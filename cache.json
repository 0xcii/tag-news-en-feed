Bitcoin has continually demonstrated endurance and growth since its  \ncreation, despite its well-known price volatility and occasional setbacks. \nFor starters,  \nBitcoin's allure stems from its scarcity and cyclical halving events. It is a  \ndeflationary digital asset with a predefined supply cap of 21 million Bitcoins.  \nThis scarcity distinguishes it from ordinary fiat currencies, which central  \nbanks can produce at will. The occurrence of Bitcoin halving events every four  \nyears slows the production of new Bitcoins.

          "description": "Bitcoin bull Cathie Wood believes gold's time has come and gone.\nThe CEO of Ark Invest weighed in on the enduring debate between the traditional safe haven asset and digital currency during a recent Bloomberg UK podcast, Merryn Talks Money. \nIn a hypothetical scenario where Wood had to choose between holding gold, a cash deposit account, or Bitcoin for a decade, she made her stance clear.\n\"It's a hedge against inflation and deflation. It's digital,\" she began, passionately advocating for Bitcoin. Wood acknowledged the time-tested appeal of gold but highlighted a crucial difference. \"Gold already has its demand; it's happened,\" she explained. In contrast, she emphasized that Bitcoin remains a fresh and evolving asset, with institutions only beginning to scratch the surface of its potential.\nWood's perspective aligns with the prevailing sentiment among younger investors who increasingly favor Bitcoin over gold. She pointed out that Bitcoin's allure lies in its technological novelty and the rising enthusiasm from millennials and Gen Z, who see it as a more attractive store of value compared to the yellow metal.\nIntriguingly, Wood made a notable observation regarding the role of both gold and Bitcoin as hedges against deflation. However, she noted that Bitcoin's recent performance suggests that it has been outshining its traditional counterpart.\nIn summary, Wood's sentiment reflects the evolving landscape of investments, with Bitcoin emerging as a powerful contender. \nTime will tell if more investors will follow suit as Bitcoin continues its recovery from 2022's brutal bear market.",

          "description": "The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is reportedly planning to expand the purview of its supervision of virtual assets to include entities that issue stablecoins. The Hong Kong regulator said it also wants to create a framework that governs banks’ provision of virtual asset custody services.\n \nHong Kong’s ‘Very Clear’ Rules\n \nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is working on expanding the scope of its supervision of virtual assets to include stablecoin issuing entities, Chen Haolian, Deputy Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has said. Speaking at the recently held Hong Kong Fintech Week, Haolian also revealed that HKMA and the region’s treasury will soon ask for the public and the banking industry’s input on this matter.\n \nAccording to a local report, the Hong Kong regulator wants to create a framework to govern banks’ provision of virtual asset custody services. Such a framework will not only ensure that customer assets are protected but it will also supposedly cement Hong Kong’s emerging reputation as a region with “very clear” rules.\n \nIn his speech at the weeklong event, the deputy secretary claimed that many European companies are interested in establishing a presence in Hong Kong. Such a presence will be used as a launchpad for the respective companies’ entry into China’s mainland market.\n \n\n \nMeanwhile, when discussing the likely impact of Web3 technology on the broader economy, Haolian argued that the technology can be the basis for solving problems in finance, education and business operations. The technology could also help improve efficiency and reduce costs, and according to Haolian, “we should seize and embrace the benefits and opportunities it brings.”\n \nConcerning blockchain, the deputy director revealed that Hong Kong has been promoting the use of this technology in the insurance industry and trade finance for more than four years.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",

A group of attorneys and blockchain engineers are building a new Bitcoin fork blockchain using an emerging legal enforcement protocol that bridges the blockchain to state and federal courts. Called Jurat, the protocol enables capabilities like freezing disputed coins or recovering stolen coins after a hack, all under the auspices of the justice system. The native coin of the new fork is called $JTC. \n \nThe primary objectives for the new blockchain are to ensure robust consumer protection for cryptocurrency users and provide on-chain enforcement for legal rights afforded in commercial transactions, property transfers, and the banking system. \n \nThe $JTC token is due to be listed on exchanges in the near future.
