          "description": "DC Circuit judges hammered the SEC’s lawyers as they defended their decision to not approve Grayscale’s move toward a spot bitcoin ETF.\nGrayscale Investments LLC participated in oral arguments on Tuesday in the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in relation to its attempts to get its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) converted to a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). In these oral arguments, the three presiding judges seemingly sided with Grayscale in their positioning.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly denied previous attempts at the introduction of a spot ETF. This has led to the firm suing the SEC, alleging that the decisions have been arbitrary and inconsistent with the Commission's decision to approve Bitcoin futures ETFs. \nIn today’s arguments, presiding judges Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan and Judges Neomi Rao continually prodded the SEC Senior Counsel Emily Parise multiple times about the SEC’s differentiation between a futures ETF and a spot bitcoin ETF. \n“[The prices] move together 99.9% of the time. So where's the gap, in the Commission's view?” asked Judge Rao. \nThe SEC response was that correlation does not equal causation, with its lawyers explaining that the key empirical question is whether fraud and manipulation in the spot markets affect futures in the same way so that they can rely on the surveillance of the future markets. Without that missing empirical piece, the SEC counsel said, the agency can't be sure it can rely on CME future surveillance to approve a spot ETF. \nQuestioning led to the pontification that the SEC had not provided sufficient evidence to explain their decision making, with Judge Rao telling Parise, “The SEC has not offered any explanation that the petitioners are wrong.”\nThe full record of the questioning can be listened to here.",

          "description": "Xrp rose higher in Tuesday’s session, as prices continued to move away from a long-term support point. Overall, sentiment in cryptocurrencies remained largely bearish, with the global market cap down 0.34% as of writing. Polygon was also in the green at the time of writing. \n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was a notable gainer on Tuesday, as the token continued to move away from a recent support point.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.3648 to start the week, XRP/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.3751 earlier in the day.\n \nThe move resulted in XRP bouncing from a long-term price floor at $0.3650, following a recent four-day losing streak.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that this took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of its own ceiling at 43.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is now tracking at 43.97, with the next visible resistance point at 45.00.\n \nShould this ceiling be hit, there is a strong chance that XRP will be trading at, or above, the $0.3800 mark.\n \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) also rose higher in today’s session, a day after bulls rejected a breakout at a key price level.\n \nMATIC/USD moved to a peak of $1.17 on Tuesday, which comes after a bottom at $1.12 the day prior.\n \nAs a result of this move, polygon bulls pushed prices further away from a recent floor at $1.10.\n \n \nOverall, it appears that this rebound coincides with the RSI moving away from a recent floor at 39.00.\n \nCurrently, price strength is tracking at 41.17, with the nearest point of resistance being at the 45.00 mark.\n \nBulls could likely target this point, and should they reach it, MATIC could move above $1.20.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect polygon to maintain this uptrend in the coming days?
