The decline saw the token fall to its weakest point in two months, breaking out of a key support point in the process. Cardano was also in the red today.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) dropped to a two-month low on Tuesday, as the token lost over 5% of its market value.\n \nAfter peaking at $0.5679 to start the week, MATIC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.5351 earlier in the day.\n \nThe sell-off saw polygon plunge to its weakest point since June 10, when price neared a breakout below $0.5000.\n \n \nToday’s move came as MATIC fell under a support point of $0.5600, with the relative strength index (RSI) also edging lower.\n \nAs of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 21.24, since slipping below a floor at the 24.00 level.\n \nShould momentum remain bearish in the coming days, it is likely MATIC will fall under $0.5000.\n \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nIn addition to MATIC, cardano (ADA) was also in the red during today’s session, falling for a second straight day.\n \nADA/USD slipped to a bottom of $0.2582 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $0.2684.\n \nThe decline sees cardano move closer to a key support point of $0.2500, following last week’s breakout below this mark.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the RSI is also edging closer to a floor of its own at 30.00, and is currently tracking at 32.56.\n \nIn the event a move occurs below this mark, ADA bears will likely look to exit short positions at $0.2400.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould cardano continue to trend lower in the coming days?
