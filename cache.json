The ETF will seek to deliver 175% of MicroStrategy's stock's daily return.\n\nJUST IN: 🇺🇸 SEC approves the first leverage long MicroStrategy ETF. pic.twitter.com/9NYrLh81sD\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 15, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nMSTX is issued by Defiance ETFs, which focuses on thematic and leveraged ETFs. According to Defiance CEO Sylvia Jablonski, the leveraged MicroStrategy ETF offers amplified exposure to Bitcoin since MicroStrategy is one of the largest corporate holders.\nAs of Q2 2024, MicroStrategy held about 226,500 Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The company took on debt to acquire most of its Bitcoin, making the stock a leveraged Bitcoin play in itself.\nJablonski said, \"Given MicroStrategy's inherent higher beta compared to bitcoin, MSTX offers a unique opportunity for investors to maximize their leverage exposure to the Bitcoin market within an ETF wrapper.\"\nLeveraged ETFs pursue daily investment objectives, meaning performance is amplified daily but varies over longer periods. MSTX carries added risks from using leverage and concentration in a single stock.\nSenior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas, commented on X that a leveraged MicroStrategy ETF \"will be the most volatile ETF you can get in the US market.\"\nThe SEC has recently allowed leveraged single-stock ETFs after years of rejecting proposals. GraniteShares and Direxion also have approval for 3x leveraged Tesla and Apple ETFs, respectively. However, leveraged equity ETFs remain a small niche, accounting for less than 1% of overall ETF assets.\nDefiance hopes MSTX can break out from the pack with the Bitcoin link. But the first-of-its-kind ETF's ultimate success will depend on investor reception and MicroStrategy's performance as a Bitcoin proxy.",
