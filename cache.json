None of the speakers at the event uttered a word about the electronic cash system or other crypto assets from the event’s main stage at Chicago’s United Center. And you’d have been hard pressed to have overheard a conversation on Bitcoin or crypto anywhere in the halls of the arena either.\nHowever, despite the fact that Democrats chose not to include Bitcoin or crypto in their official platform, some high-ranking Democrats did say this week that a Harris administration would be more pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto than the Biden administration has been — though without offering specifics. Also, at satellite events for the conference, some Democrats spoke passionately about why their party should embrace Bitcoin a…",

In this article, we dive deep into key metrics and trends to understand if the market is just cooling off or if we've already seen the peak for this cycle.\nFundamentally Overvalued?\nOne of the most reliable tools for gauging Bitcoin's market cycles is the MVRV Z-Score. This metric measures the difference between Bitcoin's market cap and its realized cap, or cost-basis for all circulating BTC, helping investors determine whether Bitcoin is over or undervalued according to this ‘fundamental’ cost of BTC.\nRecent data shows that the MVRV Z-Score has demonstrated a sustained downward movement, which might suggest that Bitcoin's u…",
