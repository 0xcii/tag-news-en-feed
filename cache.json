In line with this, a legal expert has hinted at what could happen next if the SEC were to reject these applications. \n \nApplicants To Sue SEC If Bitcoin ETF Gets Rejected\n \nLawyer and Web3 enthusiast James “MetaLawMan” Murphy mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Spot Bitcoin ETF applicants would immediately sue the SEC if all applications were denied.
