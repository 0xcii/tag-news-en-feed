Global investors flooded in like never seen before, adding almost $5 billion of inflows on the first day of trading. As a result, the crossover between traditional finance and digital assets is now firmly established, and a new door of opportunities for crypto will open as the market continues to mature. This marks the end of a decade-long struggle for legitimacy, showcasing the success of progress not only in blockchain technology itself but also in the public’s perception of money.

However this time the power stayed on and it was in large part due to an unexpected recent phenomenon: Bitcoin Mining. Bitcoin miners turned their operations off to redirect power back to critical infrastructure & reduce stress on the Texas grid.

Leveraging AI technology, the platform automatically suggests auction titles and descriptions based on uploaded item photos, enabling users to create listings in under 60 seconds.\nWith a mission to offer the lowest prices on the internet for everyday items and collectibles, according to the release, SatsCrap wants to provide buyers with various payment options, including on-chain or Lightning bitcoin, as well as fiat alternatives like credit card, Afterpay, and Cash App Pay.\nPowered by Scarce City's extensive experience in facilitating bitcoin transactions, SatsCrap aims to help redefine the future of online selling by embracing Bitcoin. The company also stated that to celebrate its launch, SatsCrap is waiving listing fees throughout February.",
