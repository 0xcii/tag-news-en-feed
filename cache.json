It would also prohibit financial institutions from interacting with privacy tools such as CoinJoin in an effort to limit the ability of users to maintain their privacy.

The token rose for a second consecutive day, hitting a key price ceiling in the process. Cardano mainly consolidated on Wednesday, as prices fell from a recent high.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) was a notable gainer on Wednesday, as prices surged to a three-week high.\n \nFollowing a low of $13.61 on Tuesday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $14.68 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result, solana moved to its strongest point since November 26, which is the last time prices were trading above a key ceiling of $14.70.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, this resistance point has yet to be broken following today’s gains, with SOL trading at $14.67 as of writing.\n \nThe 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also rose, and is currently tracking at 48.36, however it also failed to break out of a resistance level.\n \nAs of writing, the index remains below a ceiling of 49.00, which appears to be the main obstacle in place, preventing any further surges.\n \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nOn the other hand, cardano (ADA) moved away from a recent eight-day high, as price consolidated ahead of today’s FOMC meeting.\n \nADA/USD fell to a low of $0.3069 earlier in the day, which comes less than a day after hitting a peak at $0.3152.\n \nThis surge in price sent cardano to its strongest point since December 5, which is the last time price was above a ceiling of $0.3270.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it can be seen that today’s price consolidation began following a failed breakout of the 46.00 ceiling on the RSI indicator.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 43.79, with momentum appearing to be heading for a floor at 37.60.\n \nShould price strength reach this point, it is likely that ADA will be trading close to the $0.3000 support level.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect cardano to rally following today’s interest rate decision?
