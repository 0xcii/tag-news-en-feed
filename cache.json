This is because the more mining rigs are attached to the chain, the more difficult it is to perform a 51% attack.\n \nThis is only given, of course, that the hashrate is sufficiently decentralized.

Thorswap took to social media and said that the team “stands firmly against any and all criminal actions.”\n \nThorswap Pauses Amidst FTX Hack Fallout; RUNE Value Takes a Hit\n \nAfter the FTX hacker moved thousands of ether (30,000 ETH) for the first time since the November 2022 breach, onchain observers noted that the funds were sent to Thorswap and the decentralized finance (defi) application Railgun. On October 6, 2023, Thorswap updated the community and said that the dex was down for maintenance. The dex team said:\n \n\nYesterday, following a careful evaluation of the situation and consultation with advisors, legal counsel, and law enforcement, the decision was made to temporarily transition the Thorswap interface into maintenance mode.\n \nThe dex will remain paused until “until a more permanent and robust solution” becomes available. Thorchain’s native crypto asset RUNE dropped 8.6% on the news. Thorswap said the developers are doing everything they can to get the application back up and running again.\n \n\n \n“Swaps are paused. LP actions, Earn (savers), Borrow (lending), Staking actions are all fully operational,” Thorswap further detailed.\n \nConsensys product manager Taylor Monahan insisted on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that over the past four months, “more than 50% of the ether to Thorswap router to bitcoin transactions have been stolen funds.”\n \nWhat do you think about the Thorswap pause?
