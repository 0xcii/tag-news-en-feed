          "description": "According to an announcement on its website, the peer-to-peer Bitcoin platform will be shutting down before the end of February 2023.\nLocalBitcoins has announced that the exchange will be closed for service by the end of February. The long-time Bitcoin trading service was the first peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction platform for many Bitcoiners. Launched in June 2012, the exchange is one of the oldest entities in Bitcoin, establishing itself as a primary P2P player in its hey-day with over $100 million in weekly trading volume of peer-to-peer transactions.\n“Originally LocalBitcoins was established to Bring Bitcoin Everywhere and drive global financial inclusion,” the announcement reads. “We have honored that mission for over 10 years and we are proud of what we have achieved together with all of you, our loyal community.”\nThe announcement cites “challenges during the ongoing very cold crypto-winter” as reasoning for the shutdown. The exchange has informed customers that they should withdraw their funds from LocalBitcoins, as well as withdrawing their bitcoin from the LocalBitcoins wallet. It notes that customers will have 12 months to complete this process, although they encourage users to do so sooner.\nNotably, the shutdown has arrived just as P2P Bitcoin merchants and individual sellers have come under heavy scrutiny from U.S. regulatory authorities. While there is no mention of this in the announcement, it could be assumed that these recent actions have led to decreased volume on platforms like LocalBitcoins. \nDespite these pressures, alternatives such as RoboSats and Bisq still function for Bitcoiners seeking to acquire bitcoin via P2P transactions.",

          "description": "Chainlink rallied to a three-month high during Thursday’s session, despite a red wave sweeping through cryptocurrency markets. Today’s surge came as the token broke out of a key resistance level. Dogecoin, on the other hand, was victim to today’s market sell-off, falling to a ten-day low in the process.\n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nChainlink (LINK) raced to a three-month high earlier in the day, as prices broke out of a key resistance level.\n \nLINK/USD moved to a peak of $7.75 during Thursday’s session, which follows on from a bottom at $6.91 the day prior.\n \nAs a result of today’s surge, LINK jumped to its strongest point since November 8, when the token traded at a high of $9.48.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, Thursday’s rally took place as bulls broke out of a ceiling at the $7.55 level.\n \nThe 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also broke out of a resistance of its own at 59.00, and is currently tracking at 61.58.\n \nShould momentum continue in this direction, traders will likely be attempting to take profits closer to the 64.00 mark on the RSI indicator.\n \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nWhilst LINK hit a multi-month high, dogecoin (DOGE) fell victim to today’s crypto red wave, with prices falling by nearly 5%.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.09226 on Wednesday, the meme coin slipped to an intraday low of $0.08635 earlier today.\n \nThis resulted in DOGE moving to its weakest point since January 30, nearing a recent price floor in the process.\n \n \nThe aforementioned point of support is at the $0.0850 mark, which has mostly held firm since mid-January.\n \nWhilst the price floor attempted to stabilize, the support of 53.00 on the RSI indicator caved in, with the index now tracking at 50.00.\n \nDespite this, bulls have moved to buy this dip, with overall market momentum still marginally bullish, as can be seen on the moving averages.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould dogecoin rebound higher as the week progresses?
