By Dec. 31, 2023, a total of $1.51 billion was amassed, including $324.83 million in onchain fees. This surpasses the former monthly revenue record set in May, where miners collected a total of $919.22 million, with $125.92 million from onchain fees.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nIn July, miners collected a total of $865 million, with $19.21 million from fees.
