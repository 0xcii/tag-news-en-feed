The AX1 syndicate has conducted an in-depth review of the latest legal developments in the cryptocurrency space, with particular attention to the regulations, exchanges, and tax implications for both the European Union and the United States. This review aims to illuminate the evolving regulatory landscape and highlight key areas of concern and significance.\n \nThe study begins by examining the risks associated with using Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) for long-term storage of funds, particularly in light of recent CEX troubles. The review advises against using CEXs for long-term storage, even for the largest Tier 1 CEXs, due to potential risks such as regulatory enforcement, fraud, and liquidity issues​​.\n \nThe review also delves into the different crypto fiat on-ramp and off-r…",

He highlighted that MiCA brings uniformity to the registration and anti-money laundering requirements for crypto asset service providers across Europe, allowing for passporting of licenses throughout the region.\nWhen asked about the impact of MiCA on Bitcoin specifically, Vishal stated that MiCA does not differentiate between different cryptocurrencies and treats them all equally.

The newly formed exchange, which is backed by the likes of Citadel, Sequoia Capital and Fidelity, listed the coin in its offering. Litecoin was another token added to the exchange. \n \nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n \nBitcoin cash (BCH) was one of Tuesday’s notable gainers, as the token surged to a one-year high.\n \nFollowing a low of $197.30 to start the week, BCH/USD raced to an intraday peak of $236.64 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of today’s peak bitcoin cash moved nearly 18% higher, hitting its strongest point since May 2022 in the process.\n \n \nFrom the chart, a breakout above a ceiling at 80.00 on the relative strength index (RSI) appears to be one of the reasons for today’s surge.\n \nThe index is now tracking at 82.55, which is deep in overbought territory, and comes as price rose by 120% in the last seven days.\n \nBears are likely already circling the token, anticipating a potential change in direction in the coming days.\n \n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nLitecoin (LTC) was another token to be listed on the EDX platform, however prices have not risen to the extent of BCH.\n \nLTC/USD snapped a three-day losing streak on Tuesday, climbing to a peak of $89.90 earlier in the day.\n \nThis comes less than 24 hours after the cryptocurrency fell to a bottom at $86.42, despite a recent crossover of moving averages.\n \n \nThe 10-day (red) moving average rose above its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which typically signals bullish momentum.\n \nIn order for this to truly materialize, a breakout of an upcoming ceiling at 58.00 on the RSI will need to occur.\n \nAs of writing, price strength is now tracking at 56.30.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat else is behind the recent rally in bitcoin cash?
