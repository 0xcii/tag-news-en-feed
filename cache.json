The litigation that ties up developers as a result of these lawsuits is incredibly expensive, and creates major problems in the lives of developers. While funds have been put together before in order to support those who need it, rulings that reinforce the idea that Bitcoin is not a copyrighted code with limited access set important precedent. \nIt also serves as a reminder of Bitcoin's open-source nature and reinforces the idea that anyone can contribute to its development without fear of legal repercussions.
