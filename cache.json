Shortly after, around 325.19 bitcoins from January 2012 addresses were mobilized.\n \nThe initial two transfers (1 & 2) originated from wallets set up over 11 years ago on January 11, 2012. The first address shifted 145.53 BTC, while the subsequent one dispatched 21.97 BTC. Both of these transactions secured confirmation at block height 807,852 and were discovered by btcparser.com.\n \n \nIn quick succession, the address labeled “1HNnG” executed a transfer of 157.69 BTC, receiving confirmation at block height 807,853. Intriguingly, all three transactions, as per Blockchair’s privacy gauge, lacked advanced privacy measures, rendering them susceptible to transaction scrutiny.\n \nOverlapping addresses were pinpointed in these three shifts, indicating repeated address usage. Diving deeper into clustering heuristics and onchain insights, it’s evident that these three transactions likely stemmed from a singular owner. This revelation implies that in 2023 alone, 43 dormant bitcoin addresses from 2012 have been reactivated, moving their vintage coins.\n \n \nMoreover, factoring in the recent 325.19 bitcoin transaction from 2012, the year 2023 has witnessed a cumulative transfer of 3,700.97 BTC from this year, translating to a whopping $98.25 million at current BTC exchange rates.\n \nWhen the owner initially secured the coins, each bitcoin had a price tag of $6.36. Back then, the trove’s value was a modest $2,068, a stark contrast to its present worth of $8.6 million.\n \nWhat do you think about the recent sleeping bitcoin spends in 2023?

          "description": "Many Altcoins are tipped to rise significantly alongside the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, once the bull run begins. In line with this, this crypto analyst has stated the best time to buy these altcoins in preparation for this occurrence.  \n \nWhen’s The Best Time To Invest In Altcoins? \n \nAccording to the CEO and Founder of trading platform MN Trading, Michaël van de Poppe, the best time to invest in altcoins is “6-10 months prior to the Bitcoin Halving,” which happens to be around this period. The Bitcoin Halving is slated to happen sometime in April next year.\n \nPoppe stated on his X (formerly Twitter) platform that this period is the worst of the crypto market cycle but also represents the “best period to invest” as altcoins are “moving massively.”\n \n \nThe #Altcoins are breaking out…",

However, the terms of the settlement weren’t disclosed. This isn’t unusual, as some settlement agreements are kept confidential to prevent either party from disclosing the terms of the document, which the other party may want to be kept a secret. \n \nLawrence was one of many celebrities who was sued in a class action suit by investors of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX  for their role in promoting the crypto exchange, which eventually led to the company’s former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) duping…",

          "description": "Bitcoin retreated from a recent multi-week high on Saturday, as sentiment shifted bearish to start the weekend. The drop comes following a four-day win streak, leading many to see today’s declines as profit-taking. Ethereum was marginally higher.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin slipped from a two-week high to start the weekend, as bears moved to snap a recent four-day win run.\n \nBTC/USD hit a bottom of $26,240.70 earlier in today’s session, which comes following a peak at $26,840.50 the day before.\n \nThe fall appears to have come as bulls were unable to sustain recent pressure that saw BTC climb to its strongest point since August 31.\n \n \nFrom the chart, the drop coincides with the relative strength index (RSI) failing to move above a ceiling of 53.00\n \nAt the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 51.27, with a floor of 41.00 a potential target.\n \nBulls will likely look to avoid market consolidation and force a breakout of the 53.00 level, which could lead bitcoin back above $27,000.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) was marginally higher in today’s session, with the price remaining above a key support level.\n \nFollowing a low of $1,613.25 on Friday, ETH/USD rose to an intraday high of $1,652.11 earlier in the day.\n \nSaturday’s gains have somewhat eased, with the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency now trading at $1,637.80.\n \n \nLike bitcoin, this comes as bulls were unable to facilitate a break out of a resistance level, in this instance at the 48.00 zone.\n \nPrice strength currently sits at a reading of 46.39, with earlier volatility easing as the session progresses.\n \nDespite ETH now consolidating, a potential upward cross of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages could lift prices in the coming days.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill ethereum consolidate for the rest of the weekend?
