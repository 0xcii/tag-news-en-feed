We listened to our community, we learned and improved. It’s a process. Always will be. No company has the luxury to exist without challenges. But the team kept its focus. Through the fire and the flames, we carry on.\nArdoino also praised USDT reaching $95.4 billion in market cap, becoming the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, with $4 billion in excess reserves that are separated from the actual reserves backing the USDT available on the market.\nTether has not sat idle over these earnings, though, as it has slowly invested in several initiatives involving mining, energy renewables, development platforms, and artificial intelligence (AI). Ardoino mentioned Holepunch, Synonim, Northern Data, and Tether Energy, highlighting the company’s expansion into different fields to keep growing and expanding.\nThe company has also recently reinforced its compromise in the compliance area, revealing the tight integration with U.S. government agencies like the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nFinally, Ardoino revealed Tether’s plans to develop new products for 2024 and consolidate the existing ones. “They will be mind-blowing,” he concluded.\nWhat do you think about Tether’s performance in 2023?
