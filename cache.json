However, a recent report from China’s People’s Court challenges this historical stance, offering newfound recognition to virtual assets as legal property.\n \nIn a significant departure from conventional policy, the report titled “Identification of the Property Attributes of Virtual Currency and Disposal of Property Involved in the Case” asserts that virtual assets possess economic attributes that categorize them as property. \n \nThis revelation cited in a report from a local publication is a remarkable departure from China’s blanket ban on foreign digital assets, asserting that individual-held virtual assets should enjoy legal prot…",

Saturday’s surge comes despite the global market cap mostly trending lower, having fallen by 0.43% as of writing. XRP was one of the tokens to fall, dropping below a key price floor.\n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin (TON) was a notable mover in today’s session, as the token rose by as much as 10% on Saturday.\n \nAfter a low of $1.74 on Friday, TON/USD surged to an intraday peak of $1.95 to start the weekend.\n \nAs a result of the move, toncoin climbed to its strongest point since May 24, which was the last time price traded above $2.00.\n \n \nToday’s rally comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rebounded at a floor of 75.00, following a surge above 83.00.\n \nPrice strength is deeply overbought, however this has not stopped bulls from continuing to send TON even higher.\n \nThis could be a recipe for a bear trap however, with a change in direction almost certainly on the cards in the not too distant future.\n \n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was in the red to start the weekend, as the token marginally dropped below a key support point.\n \nXRP/USD fell to a bottom at $0.4886 on Saturday, which comes following a peak at $0.5081 the day prior.\n \nThis downturn comes as bears pushed price below a price floor of $0.5100 earlier in the week, with momentum continuing to slip since then.\n \n \nEver since the ripple ruling, which saw XRP price spike to an almost two-year high, the token has mostly moved lower.\n \nThe RSI is now tracking around a floor of 29.00, which is in the midst of a bear zone. However, should this level hold firm, there could be a reversal next week.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould XRP jump back above $0.5100 in the coming days?
