When you take self-custody of your own Bitcoin, you and only you are responsible for the safety of your funds.

It’s a double-edged sword: there are huge benefits to self-custody, but it also comes with responsibility.\nIf you make a mistake and send Bitcoin to the wrong address there is no undoing it. Then if someone can access your seed phrase (seed words), there is no customer support to help you, that person now has access to your money. If you lose your keys and your seed phrase backups, th…",
