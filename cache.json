This marks the largest single-day haul for the funds since March.\n\nNEW: 🇺🇸 #Bitcoin ETFs saw $886 million in inflows yesterday, the 16th straight day of inflows. \nWe are so back 🙌 pic.twitter.com/Er2KDgXr9E\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 5, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nThe ETFs have now seen 16 straight days of inflows, sparking talk of a \"second wave\" of demand. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund led inflows with $378.7 million, followed by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust at $274.4 million.\nIn total, the spot Bitcoin ETFs hold over $60 billion worth of BTC. Analysts cite renewed institutional interest and Bitcoin's price resurgence back above $70,000 as drivers of the latest wave of inflows.\nIt's the highest daily intake for the funds since March 12, when they took in a record $1.04 billion. The next day, Bitcoin went on to hit an all-time high of $73,679, showing the potential impact of the inflows.\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust also saw a rare inflow day of $28.2 million, just the seventh since converting to a spot ETF in January. It joins the renewed enthusiasm despite bleeding funds for most of the year.\nWith major firms like Fidelity and BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETFs now holding tens of billions in assets, the infrastructure for institutional Bitcoin investment continues maturing.\nThe latest inflow wave follows Australia, the U.K., and Thailand's recent approval and listing of Bitcoin-regulated funds. With the regulatory climate warming worldwide, Bitcoin ETFs are attracting capital once again.",

          "description": "In a new report, Christine Kim of the Galaxy Research team delves into the intricate governance of Ethereum, revealing how this blockchain, which underpins over 4,000 decentralized applications (dapps) and houses the largest developer community among blockchain platforms, is governed through a complex yet unofficial series of off-chain processes that involve multiple stakeholders. Ethereum, as a trailblazer in blockchain technology, follows a unique governance path distinct from Bitcoin, leaning on community-driven, decentralized processes rather than on-chain governance mechanisms.\n \nHere’s Who Controls Ethereum\n \nEthereum operates a decentralized and off-chain governance system, a deliberate design to prevent undue influence by large ETH holders or potential attackers. “Ethereum’s govern…",

          "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) is poised for a spectacular close to 2024, according to industry heavyweight Mike Novogratz. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, the Galaxy Digital CEO forecasted a price surge to $100,000 by year-end, fueled by a confluence of factors.\n \n \nBreaking Through Barriers: The $73,000 Threshold\n \nNovogratz’s prediction hinges on a crucial price point – $73,000.

His reasoning draws on the concept of “market ranges,” suggesting that once the top crypto establishes a foothold above $70,000, psychological factors could propel it further into the $100,000 territory.\n \nNovogratz said:\n \n \n“If we take $73,000 in the next couple of weeks …",
