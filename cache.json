Though the BB is a lagging indicator, like most technical indicators, including the moving average, traders associate it with tapering volatility whenever its band narrows. \n \n \nAs history shows, this “squeeze” often precedes key breakout levels (in either direction) that can shape how prices evolve in the coming sessions. …",

          "description": "A common chant from many in this space these days in response to any discussion of changes to the Bitcoin protocol is “Don’t mess with Layer 1! You can just build it on Layer 2!” This seems like a very logical thing to do, right? Why risk the security and stability of L1 when you can just build on top of it? The problem is this fundamentally fails to understand the relationship between Layer 1 and Layer 2. \nAn L2 protocol is an extension of the L1. Everything that an L2 is designed to do must ultimately reduce down to what the L1 is capable of. The blanket statement of “just do it on L2!” obfuscates numerous implicit realities of what can or can’t be done on an L2 given the current state of the base layer. For instance, imagine trying to build the Lightning Network without the existence of…",
