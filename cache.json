Reunit Wallet, an omnichain wallet built on technology developed by LayerZero & Stargate Finance, is launching a volume-based reward program.\n \nIn an effort to stimulate trading activity on its integrated platform and attract new users, Reunit Wallet is implementing a reward system for traders.\n \n\n \nStarting now, for every $100 in generated volume, users will receive 1 REUNI. Additionally, if a referral code is used, a 25% bonus will be applied.\n \nUsers who share their referral code will also enjoy a 25% bonus on the rewards generated by the traders they’ve referred.\n \nFurthermore, Reunit Wallet has plans to soon introduce a staking feature for REUNI tokens. Participants in the staking program will receive 50% of the fees generated from transactions made through Reunit Wallet.\n \nUseful links\n \n \nWebsite : https://everywhere.finance\n \nTwitter / X : https://twitter.com/EverywhereFi\n \n \nAbout Reunit Wallet :\n \nCreated by a former core-team member of Sushiswap (2020-2022), Reunit Wallet is the first natively omnichain wallet that enables seamless batch transfers across multiple blockchains with a single click. It also offers an integrated trading terminal supporting limit and market orders, providing a comprehensive and seamless trading experience.\n \nSecurity is a paramount priority for Reunit Wallet, which is why the wallet conducts a comprehensive simulation of each transaction and signature, allowing the user to anticipate the outcomes of their transaction, including token transfer confirmations or the granting of necessary permissions.\n \nContact\n \nCEO\n \nB.Naïm\n \ncontact@everywhere.finance\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis is a press release.
