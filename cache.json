          "description": "About 52 virtual currency operators have shown interest in joining Taiwan’s financial market, the Financial Supervisory Commission has said. The commission also said that it is planning to announce the region’s first virtual asset management guiding principles sometime in September.\n \nVirtual Asset-Specific Laws\n \nTaiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) recently revealed that some 52 virtual currency operators have expressed interest in joining the Taiwanese financial market. According to the regulator, some of these operators have processed the legal documents on money laundering prevention while others have yet to complete this step.\n \nAs explained in one local report, the FSC made these revelations during a public hearing conducted by a local legislator Guo Guow. In addition, the regulator also revealed that it is planning to announce sometime in September the first virtual asset management guiding principles.\n \nThe report also suggested that authorities in the region have however not ruled out setting up laws specific to virtual assets. Yet, before such laws are enacted, virtual assets will reportedly be regulated under the Money Laundering Prevention Act. As per the report, operators that fail to abide by the anti-money laundering laws face fines that range between $69,000 and $1.38 million.\n \n \nHowever, the report said under the current guidelines, aggrieved virtual asset investors cannot lodge complaints against operators with the Financial Review Center. Nevertheless, the FSC said it will still attempt to protect virtual asset users via other methods at its disposal. Some of these methods include asking operators to separate their assets from users’ funds.\n \nMeanwhile, Huang Houming, deputy director of the Securities and Futures Bureau, said after the guiding principles are released later this month, operators will be encouraged to establish associations and self-regulate.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",

The Sushi team believes the Aptos integration will unlock deeper cross-chain liquidity and elevate the trading experience across chains.\n \nAptos is a new layer one (L1) blockchain focused on scalability and claims to provide reliability, security, and usability. Its Move programming language enables developers to build Web3 applications in a different fashion. As a non-EVM chain, Aptos represents new territory for Sushi, the developers remarked.\n \n \nAccording to the announcement, “This expansion to Aptos not only unlocks a new level of deep liquidity across major blockchain networks but also significantly elevates the cross-chain trading experience.” Sushi’s team insists the decision will strengthen its leading cross-chain position by spreading to Aptos.\n \nSushi was once a top dex but volume has dropped considerably over the past few years. Defillama.com statistics show that the dex platform has $347.23 million total value locked across various protocols. Sushi’s TVL has also lost a great deal of value since November 2021, after holding more than $8 billion.\n \nWhat do you think about Sushi expanding to the L1 blockchain Aptos?

          "description": "Coinbase Cloud and blockchain infrastructure company Kiln are now allowing ethereum (ETH) users to stake any amount of ether natively. The new offering removes the previous 32 ETH minimum staking requirement.\n \nStaking for All: Coinbase Cloud and Kiln Break Down Minimum Barriers\n \nWith the integration of Kiln’s onchain staking platform, Coinbase Cloud and its clients can enable partial ETH staking. This allows wallet providers like Coinbase Wallet to give users the ability to earn staking rewards without needing to meet minimums. The press announcement notes that over 99 percent of ether wallets hold less than the 32 ETH previously required to stake on the network.\n \n“We are thrilled to have worked with Coinbase Cloud and to welcome them as the first (non-Kiln) node operator leveraging the Kiln Onchain Staking Platform,” said Kiln CEO Laszlo Szabo. The Kiln CEO added:\n \n \nThis integration with Coinbase Cloud is unique because it allows them to enable other wallets and services, including [decentralized exchanges], with the same limitless [ether] staking solution that will be offered by Coinbase Wallet.\n \n \n \nPartial ETH staking builds on Coinbase Cloud’s existing staking infrastructure. The company said its multi-cloud, multi-region setup ensures reliability alongside trusted security standards. Coinbase further discloses that staking operations occur transparently onchain through audited smart contracts.\n \nCoinbase posits that by removing staking minimums, more individual users can participate in securing the Ethereum network while earning rewards. The move comes as staked ETH ratios continue rising after Ethereum’s recent upgrade. Coinbase Cloud is currently offering this new open staking access starting with integration in Coinbase Wallet.\n \nWhat do you think about Coinbase and Kiln’s announcement?
