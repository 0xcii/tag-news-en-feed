          "description": "UPDATE, 1:35pm, 9/13/2023 - A PayPal spokesperson says its infrastructure partner Paxos was responsible for the overpayment: “Paxos overpaid the BTC network fee on Sept. 10, 2023. This only impacted Paxos corporate operations. Paxos clients and end users have not been affected and all customer funds are safe. This was due to a bug on a single transfer and it has been fixed. Paxos is in contact with the miner to recoup the funds.”\nIn a surprising turn of events, PayPal, the global online payments giant, reportedly overpaid a staggering $510,750 on a Bitcoin transaction fee. The incident, initially thought to be a \"fat-fingered\" mistake, has now been traced back to an issue within PayPal's processing system, according to a report by Mempool's Mononautical. This is the largest fee ever paid f…",
