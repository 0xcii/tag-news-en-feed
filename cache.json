Thursday’s report is expected to show that consumer prices have fallen to 6.5%, down from 7.1% the month prior. Ethereum also rose marginally higher in the day.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) rallied above a key resistance level on Wednesday, ahead of tomorrow’s U.S. inflation report.\n \nFollowing a low of $17,226.64 on Tuesday, BTC/USD raced to a peak of $17,493.32 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of the move, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed to its strongest point since December 15.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, today’s price surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a resistance point at the 60.00 mark.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 63.80. This comes as BTC continues to hover around its own ceiling at the $17,400 mark.\n \nIn order to move closer to the $18,000 zone, the RSI will first need to move beyond a ceiling of 64.00 on the RSI.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) was also marginally higher in today’s session, with prices continuing to trade below a long-term ceiling\n \nETH/USD hit a high of $1,342.76 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,324.97.\n \nOverall, ethereum remains below a resistance point of $1,350, with many expecting prices to move after the release of U.S. inflation figures tomorrow.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, the consolidation below this price ceiling comes as the RSI continues to trade under a hurdle of its own.\n \nPrice strength is now tracking at the 68.73 level, which is under a point of resistance at the 70.00 mark.\n \nETH bulls are likely still targeting a move beyond $1,400, however, in order for this to happen, the RSI level of 70.00 must first be overcome.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill cryptocurrency prices surge following the release of inflation figures?

Many countries socialize the cost of healthcare through the government on a sliding scale from total government control to private market healthcare, with a sprinkle of government-provided health insurance for the poor and the elderly.\nIn the United States, we primarily have a private healthcare system.

Moreover, they want to invest in a variety of tools with the same speed and commissions as centralized platforms.
