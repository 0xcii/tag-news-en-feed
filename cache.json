This downturn is occurring amidst a climate of fear and uncertainty impacting both the cryptocurrency and US stock markets. \n \n \nRecent data from Santiment highlights a notable shift: Bitcoin is becoming progressively less sensitive to fluctuations in equities. This suggests that while both markets grapple with volatility, their interactions may not be as intertwined. \n \nAs we move forward, price action might be influenced more by its market dynamics rather than broader stock market trends. This shift could mean that, despite ongoing volatility, the fundamental correlation between US stocks and BTC might diminish, leading to a period where BTC’s movements are increasingly drive…",

Additionally, Harris's official fundraising site does not yet display crypto donation options. So far, Harris’s campaign and Coinbase were reached out to for comment, but Fortune has not heard back yet at the time of writing.\nThe \"Crypto for Harris\" initiative, launched last month, aims to garner support from crypto enthusiasts as Harris seeks to strengthen her presidential bid. \n“She has a huge opportunity, we’re cautiously optimistic,” Haas reportedly continued. “She has not rolled out the details yet, but she has made overtures that she would like to drive crypto legislation.”\nHarris’ decision to accept cryptocurrency donations marks a strategic move to rival her opponent Donald Trump, who earlier this year embraced Bitcoin Lightning Network donations for his campaign. Trump's alignment with the Bitcoin community was further solidified when he spoke at The Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville—an event Harris notably declined to attend.",
