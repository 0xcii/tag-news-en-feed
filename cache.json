Happy 15th anniversary to Satoshi’s famous white paper that started crypto.\"\nThis unexpected celebration of the Bitcoin white paper by the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has sparked intrigue and discussion among Bitcoin enthusiasts and investors, as the SEC has to make decisions on multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications soon. Some of the worlds largest financial institutions, notably $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, are hoping to become the first applicants in the country to get approval for this product.\nThe 15th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper is significant as it marked the birth of a new era in finance and technology. Bitcoin has since challenged traditional financial systems and institutions, amassing over $670 billion in market cap as of today, and became a national currency. \nMore information on the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF race can be found here.",
