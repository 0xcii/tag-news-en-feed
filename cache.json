Cardano was also higher on Wednesday, hitting a one-month high.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP rose to its highest point since November, as markets continued to react to the latest news surrounding Ripple’s case with the SEC.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.4199 on Tuesday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4914 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThis is the strongest point that the token has reached since November 6, when prices were retreating from a high above $0.50.\n \n \nOverall, earlier gains have since eased, which comes as bulls failed to sustain a breakout on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 65.14, which is below the aforementioned ceiling at 70.00.\n \nThe 10-day (red) moving average remains in an uptrend despite the marginal decline, which sees XRP currently trading at $0.4459.\n \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) was once again higher in today’s session, as the token jumped to a one-month high.\n \nADA/USD moved to a peak of $0.387 on Wednesday, which comes a day after falling to a low at $0.349.\n \nToday’s surge saw bulls push cardano to its highest level since February 23, when price was at a peak of $0.393.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it appears that the climb coincided with the 10-day (red) moving average crossing over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nIn addition to this, the 14-day RSI is now tracking at 60.93, which is its highest reading since mid-February.\n \nA ceiling at 53.00 may await for bulls should momentum continue in this current direction, which could put a stop to the run.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould cardano begin to change direction in the upcoming days?
