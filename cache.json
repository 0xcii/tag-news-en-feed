Bitcoin also rose on the news, climbing closer to $17,000\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) moved closer to the $17,000 level on Tuesday, as traders reacted to the latest Bank of Japan policy decision.\n \nBTC/USD surged to a peak of $16,837.65 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after hitting a low of $16,398.14.\n \nToday’s move saw the token climb above a key resistance level of $16,700, with prices rising to a four-day high in the process.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the surge took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at the 46.00 level.\n \nAs of writing, the index is currently tracking at the 46.61 mark, which is its strongest point since last Thursday.\n \nShould the index continue this upward trend, we will likely see BTC move above the $17,000 level in the coming days.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also trended higher on Tuesday, as it once again rose into the $1,200 region.\n \nFollowing a low of $1,160.38 to start the week, ETH/USD raced to a peak of $1,214.73 earlier in the day.\n \nThis comes despite the fact that there has been a recent downward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.\n \n \nAs of writing, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency seems set to collide with a higher resistance at the $1,230 level.\n \nThis could prove to be challenging however, with the 14-day RSI now hovering directly below a ceiling at 47.00.\n \nShould there be a break of this key threshold, we will likely see more ETH bulls reenter the market.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill we see today’s bull run continue throughout the week?
