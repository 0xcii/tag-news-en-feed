          "description": "The Japanese government has approved a tax reform that removes some crypto taxes for corporations and conglomerates. The reform, discussed since early December, removes the unrealized gains taxes on crypto holdings for companies, paving the way for them to hold crypto assets more consistently.\nJapanese Government Approves Tax Reform to Eliminate Unrealized Gains Tax\nThe Japanese cabinet convened to approve the FY2018 tax reform, which includes a series of modifications to rules affecting companies in the cryptocurrency area. The reform included a change that removed the “unrealized gains” crypto tax that mandated companies to pay tribute based on the price change of crypto assets each fiscal year.\nA change that eliminated this tax for companies’ self-issued cryptocurrencies had already been approved earlier this year, but with this modification, crypto companies can now hold crypto issued by third parties without paying the unrealized gains taxes.\nHowever, cryptocurrency sales and purchases will continue to be taxed. This opposes the petition of the Japan Crypto Asset Business Association, which asked for eliminating the tax on crypto exchanges. According to local media, the measure will contribute to a general reduction in tax-derived income for June 2024, expected to be the largest since 1989.\nThe reform, which had been in discussion since early December, is directed to make it easier for corporations to add crypto to their treasury without paying for simply holding it. Japan is one of the few countries that applies this unrealized crypto gains tax, prompting companies to hold these assets in other countries.\nNonetheless, even after this approval, the tax reform will have to be presented to the Diet next year and will have to be passed by both houses.\nWhat do you think about the unrealized gains crypto tax exemption for companies in Japan? Tell us in the comments section below.",

          "description": "Arthur Hayes, former CEO of Bitmex and cryptocurrency market analyst, pondered about the success of an upcoming spot bitcoin ETF and its effect on the future of bitcoin. Hayes states that the popularity of these ETF derivatives might concentrate the custody of all the bitcoin in a few hands that won’t move it, forcing miners to capitulate due to a lack of activity in the blockchain.\nArthur Hayes Believes ETFs Might Cause the Demise of Bitcoin\nFormer Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes believes that the success of an upcoming spot bitcoin ETF might endanger the existence of the Bitcoin network. In his most recent blog post, “Expression,” Hayes presents a hypothetical situation in which bitcoin is all in the hands of a few financial firms, like Blackrock.\nIf this happens, Hayes anticipates this will destroy bitcoin as a store of value, given that it is different from all of the assets traded in financial markets until now.\nHayes argued:\nBitcoin is the first monetary asset in human history that exists only if it moves. But if there was never another Bitcoin transaction between two entities, miners would be unable to afford the energy it costs to secure the network.\nThe result of this would be the shutdown of the whole Bitcoin network due to the starvation of miners who will receive fees only from bitcoin transactions after the subsidy ends circa 2140.\nHayes adds that this could happen if users come to value bitcoin as a financial asset more than a store of value, favoring the purchase of derivatives instead of the cryptocurrency. However, if bitcoin suffers this fate, Hayes anticipates the birth of a similar asset to allow people to transact in a non-state-owned financial system.\n“Hopefully, the second time around, we will learn not to hand our private keys to the baldies,” he concluded.\nWhat do you think about Hayes’ opinion on the success of a spot bitcoin ETF and its effect on bitcoin?
