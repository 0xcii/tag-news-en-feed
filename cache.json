While GBTC bled funds, IBIT saw steady inflows that now make it the dominant player.\nGrayscale has witnessed accelerating outflows as investors pivot to BlackRock's ETF and other spot bitcoin products due to its high fees. On Tuesday alone, GBTC saw a $105 million exit while IBIT gained over $100 million.\nThe rise of IBIT also beats out the $11 billion Fidelity Bitcoin ETF for the top spot. Its rapid ascent to over $20 billion in assets also makes it one of the fastest-growing ETFs ever.\nBlackRock is adding IBIT to its Strategic Income and Strategic Global Bond funds this week, further validating institutional demand.
