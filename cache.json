According to a post on the Bitcoin dev mailing list, Ark offers an alternative scaling approach that allows users to send and receive funds without liquidity constraints, making it easier for recipients to get paid without an onboarding setup. Unlike other Layer 2 solutions like Lightning, Ark does not require the opening and closing of channels, reducing the on-chain footprint significantly.\n \n         \n         \n         \n        Image source \n    \nThe protocol operates using virtual UTXOs (vTXOs), which are short-lived notes that expire after four weeks.
