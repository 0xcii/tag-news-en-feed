Analysts cite renewed institutional interest and Bitcoin's price resurgence back above $70,000 as drivers of the latest wave of inflows.\nIt's the highest daily intake for the funds since March 12, when they took in a record $1.04 billion. The next day, Bitcoin went on to hit an all-time high of $73,679, showing the potential impact of the inflows.\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust also saw a rare inflow day of $28.2 million, just the seventh since converting to a spot ETF in January. It joins the renewed enthusiasm despite bleeding funds for most of the year.\nWith major firms like Fidelity and BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETFs now holding tens of billions in assets, the infrastructure for institutional Bitcoin investment continues maturing.\nThe latest inflow wave follows Australia, the U.K., and Thailand's recent approval and listing of Bitcoin-regulated funds.
