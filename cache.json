This abrupt reduction in revenue poses challenges for miners, particularly those operating on narrow profit margins.\n \n \nAccording to a report by cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, The halving’s immediate effect is a 50% decline in miners’ income, which could render some operati…",

          "description": "On March 14, 2024, El Salvador’s president-elect, Nayib Bukele, unveiled a historic bold maneuver that echoed across the Bitcoin world: El Salvador confirmed the transfer of a substantial portion of its Bitcoin holdings into cold storage, securely kept within a vault in its national borders. This strategic decision marks a pivotal juncture in El Salvador's Bitcoin journey since the introduction of the Bitcoin Law, which has drawn both admiration and skepticism worldwide.\nAmidst a cacophony of critiques ranging from allegations of human rights violations to inadequate modern infrastructure, El Salvador has stood committed, weathering storms of disapproval from traditional finance stalwarts and even fervent Bitcoin maximalists on Twitter (X) Spaces. The veil of ambiguity surrounding the size…",

          "description": "Commerceblock has released a new atomic swap protocol for use with statechains on their Mercury Layer protocol. The HSM server has introduced functionality to support atomically swapping two statechains, as well as enforcing an atomic exchange of a statechain for a Lightning payment. This is the first example of concretely defined and built interactions between statechains and the Lightning Network. Synergy between both protocols has been postulated since the concept of a statechain was originally proposed by Ruben Somsen, specifically as a way to solve the limitation of having to transfer a whole statechain UTXO at once.\nBasic Statechain Swaps \nIn order to support the new swap protocols, the HSM server needs to add some new fields to its database entries tracking each statechain it is fac…",
