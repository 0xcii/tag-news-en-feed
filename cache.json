Speaking at the annual Jackson Hole symposium, Powell hinted that more hikes were in the cards. Ethereum moved back towards a recent support point.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin continued to trade near the $26,000 region to start the weekend, as markets failed to react to Jerome Powell’s comments at the Jackson Hole symposium.\n \nPowell stated that, “We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”\n \nBTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $25,914.93 on the comments, following Friday’s high at $26,406.15.\n \n \nPrice has since moved back above $26,000, as the relative strength index (RSI) began to trend sideways.\n \nAs of writing, price strength is now tracking at 25.71, which is closer to a ceiling of 29.00 than a floor of 20.00.\n \nShould the index move beyond the 29.00 level, there could be more bulls reentering the market.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) edged lower on Saturday, as traders were underwhelmed by yesterday’s speech by the Fed chair.\n \nFollowing a peak at $1,665.14 during yesterday’s session, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,641.63 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of the decline, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moved below a support point of $1,650.\n \n \nThis week has seen ETH mostly trade between a low of $1,580 and a high of $1,690, with some occasional breakouts.\n \nFor bulls, a surge will need to occur at the resistance level of 33.00 on the RSI, in order for momentum to truly shift upward.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat is behind the recent market consolidation?
