Commenting on the crypto exchange’s entry into the South African market, Joshua Yau, the regional manager for Africa, said:\n \n“This marks a significant milestone for Bybit as we bring access to global leading products to the passionate crypto community in South Africa in line with regulatory requirements. This marks an important step in our compliance efforts. We are committed to providing a secure and seamless trading experience, industry-leading trading tools, and low-cost access that empower our users.”\n \nBen Zhou, the founder and CEO of Bybit, characterized the incursion into South Africa as the latest testimony of the crypto exchange’s commitment to its goal of making crypto trading accessible to all.\n \nRegister your email here to get a weekly update on African news sent to your inbox:\n \n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

After nine long months, the disgraced crypto founder will finally have the chance to defend himself against a wide array of federal fraud and conspiracy charges tied to the collapse of FTX, his crypto and futures exchange, and Alameda Research, the crypto trading firm he founded and – according to prosecutors – used to illegally re-invest FTX user funds.",
