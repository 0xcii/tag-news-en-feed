The ETF will track the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin ETFs through active investment. It has received approximately $53 million in initial investments at a listing price of $1 (HKD 7.75).\nThe approval of the ETFs has both positive and negative connotations — while it signals acceptance amongst traditional finance in the Asian markets, it is not truly bitcoin in the sense that one cannot exchange the ETF shares for real bitcoin, nor is the ETF itself backed by a reserve of actual bitcoin. There are claims that such “paper bitcoin” can suppress the price of real bitcoin through diversion of demand. \n\nThe first bitcoin futures ETF approved in America, the NYSE-listed ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, launched in October of 2021, with $1 billion in trading volume on its first day. Per the release, “In view of the increasing market acceptance of virtual assets, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission announced to allow the launch of ETFs tracking crypto futures for public offering on 31 October 2022, marking the first time Asian retail investors can get this type of exposure to virtual assets.”",

          "description": "Dogecoin was trading close to a three-week low on Thursday, following the release of retail sales figures in the United States. Customer spending fell by more than expected in November, dropping by 0.6% last month. Litecoin slipped for a second successive session, falling to its lowest point since late November. \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) remained in the red on Thursday, as prices fell for the ninth day out of the last eleven.\n \nThe recent decline saw DOGE hit a low of $0.08694 earlier in today’s session, which is nearly 4% lower than Wednesday’s peak of $0.09224.\n \nThis move saw the meme coin fall to its lowest point since Monday, nearing a three-week low of $0.0848 in the process.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, bearish sentiment has increased as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell from its recent floor at the 47.50 mark.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 42.40, with a floor of 40.00 the next possible destination.\n \nShould this point of support be reached, we will likely see DOGE trading near the $0.0840 level.\n \n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nLitecoin (LTC) was another notable token to fall today, with prices moving lower for a second straight day.\n \nFollowing a high of $78.96 on Wednesday, LTC/USD dropped to a bottom of $74.07 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of this drop, litecoin moved to its lowest point since November 28, when prices hit a bottom of $70.50.\n \n \nLike with dogecoin above, today’s sell-off coincided with the RSI hitting a low of 50.20, which is close to a floor of 50.00.\n \nBulls anticipating a reversal may look at this with some optimism, and could look to reenter at this point of support.\n \nHowever, should this floor fail to hold firm, then we will likely see LTC edge closer to a drop below $70.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould we see litecoin rebound in the coming days?
