Prices have risen by as much as 10% in that period, with the latest surge sending the cryptocurrency above $0.50. Solana was also higher, hitting a multi-week high of its own.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly known as ripple, was one of the biggest movers in cryptocurrency markets on Tuesday, as it rose above $0.50.\n \nXRP/USD raced to a peak of $0.5049 earlier in today’s session, after starting the week trading at a low of $0.4779.\n \nAs a result of this surge, the token moved to its strongest point since April 19, when it hit a high of $0.5390.\n \n \nToday’s rally has also led to the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hitting its highest reading since March 31.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 67.55, which is marginally below a ceiling of 68.00.\n \nIn the event this upcoming ceiling is broken, there is a reasonable chance that XRP moves closer to March’s high.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) was also in the green, as it moved close to a key resistance level of $21.50.\n \nAfter trading at a low of $20.30 during Monday’s session, SOL/USD bulls took the token to a high of $21.37 today.\n \nThis surge saw SOL hit its highest level since May 8, when the token was trading above $21.80.\n \n \nFollowing recent gains, solana is now trading 7% higher than at the same point last week, with today’s rally sending the RSI to a ceiling at 55.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is hovering marginally below this point, which has resulted in a drop from today’s peak.\n \nBulls will firstly need to overcome the ceiling at 55.00, and should they achieve this, SOL will likely move above $22.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect a breakout in the coming days?

          "description": "Umbrel, the company behind umbrelOS, has introduced a new home server solution called Umbrel Home with the intent of providing users control over their data, privacy and digital lives, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Priced at $699, Umbrel Home is aimed at making self-hosting accessible to everyone. By leveraging umbrelOS, users can eliminate the need for third-party cloud services by utilizing a wide range of self-hosted apps available in the Umbrel App Store including a Bitcoin/Lightning node, Nextcloud, Plex and Home Assistant.\n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \nAccording to the press release, Umbrel Home offers accelerated performance, featuring a 2.9GHz Quad-Core Intel CPU, 2TB NVMe SSD, 16GB dual-channel RAM, and an active cooling system while consuming just 10 watts of power. This compact home server outperforms a Raspberry Pi 4-based solution in terms of CPU performance, SSD read and write speeds, RAM and memory bandwidth the release states.\nMayank Chhabra, Umbrel's Co-founder and CEO, highlighted the company's vision for Umbrel Home, saying that \"Building a plug-and-play home server that was specifically engineered for umbrelOS has been our dream since day one. With the recent challenges in Raspberry Pi pricing and supply chain, we knew it was time to bring our vision to life, set a new benchmark in self-hosting, and make it accessible to users of all skill levels.\"\nWith privacy and data ownership concerns on the rise, self-hosting presents a modern solution that allows users to take ownership of their data, storage, access and sharing. In addition, Umbrel Home’s zero-configuration and one-click app installations from the Umbrel App Store make it easy to build a customized ecosystem tailored to individual needs.\nPre-orders for Umbrel Home are now available on umbrel.com, with shipping set to begin in June 2023. With its exceptional performance, user-friendly features and affordability, Umbrel Home aims to make self-hosting accessible to a global audience.",
