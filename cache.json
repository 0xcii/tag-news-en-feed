A press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine said the foundation aims to restore financial power to individuals and promote personal and financial freedoms. It takes a critical stance against KYC practices and, according to the release, believes that technology should empower individuals rather than control them. \nThe Vexl Foundation has also introduced the Financial Tyranny Index (FTI), which measures the extent of statist interventions in the financial space. Initial findings, according to Vexl, reveal high levels of financial state control in Western democracies such as France, Belgium, Canada and the Netherlands.\nThe Vexl Foundation's mission is supported by its mobile app, Vexl, which provides a private and secure platform for peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions without KYC or institutional interference. Lea Petrášová, CEO of Vexl.it, describes it as more than just an application, stating, \"It's the embodiment of our vision for financial autonomy.\"\nThe board of the Vexl Foundation consists of individuals with diverse experiences, including Lea Petrášová, Josef Tětek and Grafton Clark, as well as SatoshiLabs Co-founders Marek Palatinus and Pavol Rusnák. The release stated that they are dedicated to challenging the centralization of control and directing power back to individuals.\nThe foundation said it welcomes collaboration with organizations and individuals who share the vision of a free and open financial world. With donations and guidance from SatoshiLabs, the Vexl Foundation is aimed at inspiring a shift in the perception and interaction with digital finance.\nMarek Slush Palatinus emphasized the need to revisit the principles on which Bitcoin was founded, stating, \"The Vexl Foundation is our step towards that change.\"\nTo learn more about the Vexl Foundation and its initiatives, interested parties are encouraged to visit their website at https://vexl.foundation.",

          "description": "Cardano dropped to a three-month low on Thursday, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remained largely bearish. The move comes as traders continue to worry about what the recent Binance and Coinbase lawsuits could mean for the wider market. Solana also slipped to a multi-month low.\n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) plunged to a three-month low on Thursday, as traders remained nervous, following the recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits.\n \nAfter a high of $0.3376 on Wednesday, ADA/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.3196 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe drop pushed the token to its lowest level since March 15, when price was at a bottom of $0.3166.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, this decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) moved deep into oversold territory, falling to a low below 30.00.\n \nThe index has since rebounded, and is tracking at 34.21, which is marginally above a key level of resistance at the 33.00 mark.\n \nShould this upward momentum continue, bulls will look to recapture the $0.3500 level.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nIn addition to ADA, solana (SOL) sank to a multi-month low of its own during today’s session.\n \nSOL/USD fell to an intraday low of $18.29 on Thursday, which comes less than a day after the price was above $20.00.\n \nAs a result of this latest decline, solana fell to its weakest point since March 13, when the price was under $18.00.\n \n \nOverall, SOL is down by almost 9% in the last seven days, with the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) in free fall as a result.\n \nShould the trend line maintain its current course, there will be a downward cross with the 25-day (blue) MA.\n \nFor bears who still remain despite the recent oversold status, the next target will likely be $16.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould solana fall to $16.00 this week?
