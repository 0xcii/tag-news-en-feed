Capula's significant investment in Bitcoin ETFs reflects a further growing acceptance of Bitcoin among traditional financial institutions.\nThis investment aligns with a broader trend of institutional adoption, as more firms seek exposure to the potential upside of BTC. The SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has made it easier for institutions to invest in Bitcoin, providing a more accessible and regulated vehicle for participation in this burgeoning market.\nAnd despite Bitcoin's recent plunge from $67,500 to $49,000, large institutions continue to show confidence in Bitcoin. Data from Arkham indicates that major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and MicroStrategy are not selling their Bitcoin holdings, and are likely buying more. \n\nYou guys sold all your coins\n… But\nBlackRock\nMicroStrategy\nGrayscale\nFidelity\ndidn’t. pic.twitter.com/R2NY3rDPcQ\n— Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) August 5, 2024",
