Starting in 2020, under Saylor's direction, it adopted Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset.\nIt's average purchase price per Bitcoin remains around $35,000. With Bitcoin trading near $68,000, the firm is still significantly in the green on its holdings.\nThe latest $500 million capital raise comes via selling convertible senior notes to qualified institutional buyers. The notes will pay interest semiannually and mature in 2032 unless converted or redeemed earlier.\nAccording to the announcement, MicroStrategy may use the funds for general corporate purposes, but Bitcoin acquisition remains the priority. The company will also grant initial purchasers an option to buy an additional $75 million of notes.\nMicroStrategy's Bitcoin-buying obsession has made it a Wall Street proxy for Bitcoin itself. The company's stock often rises and falls with Bitcoin's price movements, with investors betting on BTC's upside.\nWith this latest capital injection, MicroStrategy is signaling its conviction that Bitcoin will continue appreciating over the long term. Saylor is ready to double down by acquiring more coins while prices remain relatively low.",

The payment service enables contributions to Trump's campaign.\nThe Biden campaign's outreach is reportedly an effort to appeal to Bitcoin and crypto-focused voters ahead of the hotly contested 2024 election. \nHowever, the news sparked a backlash from some industry figures. Critics argued it was hypocritical given the Biden administration's hostile stance toward the industry, including a recent veto of bipartisan crypto legislation.\nSources say Biden's team wants to signal a friendlier posture on Bitcoin and crypto. With the election expected to come down to razor-thin margins, Bitcoin and crypto voters could prove decisive. \nBillionaire Mark Cuban suggested Biden's indifference to crypto could hand Trump the presidency. Recent polls give Trump a double-digit lead among crypto holders.\nThe Biden campaign did not officially confirm the reports on potential crypto donations. Sources stressed talks are still exploratory as Biden gauges the Bitcoin and crypto landscape.\nThe engagement nonetheless shows Bitcoin's growing influence. Both parties realize appeasing Bitcoin supporters is now necessary, even if symbolic. With potential voters and donors at stake, expect more Bitcoin pandering as November nears.",

          "description": "Civkit, a project attempting to revitalize the global peer-to-peer economy, announced the release of its first alpha version following over a year of dedicated development. The protocol aims to enable peer-to-peer trading in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need for a centralized order book. The design is architected around Nostr and Lightning, with a reputation system at its core.\nA team of anonymous developers, led by Nicholas Gregory (Commerceblock, MercuryLayer), has been working behind the scenes to bring this vision to life. \"The project is funded by people in the global south. Much of the work has involved understanding their actual needs rather than imposing our assumptions,\" says Gregory. \"Ray Youseff and Noones have provided funding for some developers, including one who lives in the global south, allowing us to test in regions where this solution is most needed.\"\nThe Civkit Node provides a UI to create P2P trade orders. You can use this to create buy/sell orders for peer-to-peer trades, pay the hold invoices, chat with the trading partner, confirm fiat received to release payment, raise disputes (in the chat app), and view other trade orders. \nUsing a custom Nostr event type, CivKit allows orders to be shared among Nostr relays accepting these types to create a global orderbook. The escrow system returns BOLT11 invoices, locking 5% of the trade amount in a hold invoice which is released upon trade completion. A URL is provided to access the encrypted chat, which includes basic dispute features. \nThe team expects the alpha version of the Civkit reputation system to be released in two weeks. Following this, the focus will shift to federating the order book and escrow with Fedimint, and subsequently incorporating eCash support.\n\"This is a very ambitious project with a long way to go, but it's exciting to see our first tangible results,\" Gregory adds.",
