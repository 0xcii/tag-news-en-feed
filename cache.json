          "description": "On-chain analysis platform Spot On Chain has drawn the crypto community’s attention to two traders who have made impressive profits from trading Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE). This development again highlights potential rewards one could make from investing in this category of crypto tokens.  \n \nWhales Cash Out Big Time From Shiba Inu And PEPE\n \nSpot On Chain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post about a whale who had deposited 200 SHIB tokens ($6.94 million) to crypto exchanges Gemini and Crypto.com in an act of profit-taking. This trader is said to have bought 15.2 trillion SHIB with just 10 ETH about 4 years ago. \n \n \nBack then, he purchased these tokens for $29.015 million (and an average price of $0.000001625 for each SHIB). Since then, on-chain data shows that the trader has co…",

          "description": "Eleven approved Bitcoin ETFs have painted the pioneering cryptocurrency with a fresh coat of legitimacy. By receiving an official blessing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an institutional investing barrier has been lifted.\nWith this barrier gone, financial advisors, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies and retail investors can now receive Bitcoin exposure without hassling with direct custodianship. More importantly, a taint has been scrubbed off from Bitcoin, previously likened to “tulip mania”, “rat poison”, or “index of money laundering”.\nFollowing the unprecedented domino of crypto bankruptcies throughout 2022, Bitcoin price reverted to November 2020 level of $15.7k by the end of that year.

          "description": "Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back, one of the earliest cypherpunks who helped lay the ideological foundation for Bitcoin, believes that the bitcoin price is on its way to hitting $100,000, and that the move is \"overdue.\" \nBack has been involved with Bitcoin since its earliest days, contributing to technology like Hashcash, which influenced Satoshi Nakamoto's design of the proof-of-work system that secures Bitcoin and finalizes its transactions.\nIn a recent interview, Back explained his bullish perspective on Bitcoin's potential. \"I think it's kind of overdue already,\" he said about Bitcoin reaching a six-figure valuation.\n\"Bitcoin has been performing quite well, and many new applications like Strike have come online, providing easy user interfaces. The fundamentals and price have diverged somewhat, so I think the price will catch up.\"\nBack doubled down on his $100,000 prediction in a post on X saying, \"I think the reason things are muted is that $100k seems way overdue, for a few years now. There's not much bull market euphoria as the $1-5k green candles scroll by. Just tick tock $100k.\"\nBack's comments come after Bitcoin rallied in 2023 following a brutal bitcoin winter in 2022. The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January has since reignited interest in the asset class. \nThe British cryptographer is one of the most respected veterans in the space, making his bullish price prediction noteworthy. \nIn addition to pioneering early digital currency and proof-of-work research, Back is the CEO of Blockstream, a Bitcoin technology company focused on development, but that also has significant investments in mining.\nWith Bitcoin trading around $72,600 when this article was written, a jump to $100,000 would represent a 37.7% gain from current levels. \nWhile a six-figure bitcoin price remains controversial, Back believes the network fundamentals combined with increasing institutional adoption make it possible in the years ahead. \nIf the prediction comes true, it would represent a new all-time high for Bitcoin.",
