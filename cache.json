          "description": "Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

          "description": "Montana has ratified legislation that protects the right to mine bitcoin, a win for sound money in the midwestern state.\nThe Montana legislature has passed a bill that protects the right to mine bitcoin, among other provisions. The bill is designed to give Bitcoin miners the right to mine “without being subjected to undue discrimination or requirements.”\nBitcoin mining has faced difficulty with regulations at the state and local level before, so this bill provides legal certainty for the industry. Montana is among the first states to provide legal protection for bitcoin mining.\nThe new legislation would also prohibit discriminatory digital asset mining utility rates, prohibit local government powers related to digital asset mining, and prohibit specific taxation on the use of cryptocurrency as a payment method. \nAdditionally, the bill provides for digital assets as personal property. According to the bill, the Montana Public Service Commission may not establish a rate classification for digital asset mining, digital asset mining businesses or home digital asset mining that creates unduly discriminatory rates. The bill also states that digital assets used as a method of payment may not be subject to additional taxation or charges by the state or local government.\nThe bill would help Montana's economy by giving legal certainty to the digital asset mining industry, encouraging investment in Montana, and attracting new businesses to the state. The bill also helps to ensure the stability of Montana's power grid.",

          "description": "Now headed to the state Senate, HB690 rectifies language that previously encompassed Bitcoin in its goal of restricting CBDC usage.\nThe North Carolina House of Representatives has unanimously passed House Bill 690, which prohibits the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) for payments to the state or any participation by the state in Federal Reserve branch testing of CBDC. The bill is now headed to the state Senate, where it is expected to be approved as well.\nThe latest version of the bill replaces the term \"cryptocurrency\" with \"central bank digital currency,\" which is defined as a digital currency, a digital medium of exchange, or a digital monetary unit of account issued by the US Federal Reserve System or a federal agency. \nThis new edition came after lawmakers seemingly mistakenly first introduced the bill with language that would encompass bitcoin as well. The bill also prohibits any state agency or the General Court of Justice from accepting payments using CBDCs and from participating in any test of a CBDC by any Federal Reserve branch.\nDan Spuller, Director of Industry Affairs at the Blockchain Association, explained to Bitcoin Magazine how the bill could serve as a model for other states, including Tennessee and Virginia. He also expressed his support for Bitcoin, stating that \"any bill that is anti-CBDC is pro-Bitcoin.\" Spuller added that the bill’s language aimed to keep things \"fairly simple, to the point and effective.\"\nThe bill received unanimous approval from the North Carolina House of Representatives, with a vote of 118-0. After the bill heads to the state Senate, if approved, it will need to be signed into law by the governor.",
