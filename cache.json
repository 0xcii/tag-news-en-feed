          "description": "BNB was one of Wednesday’s biggest movers, as the token rebounded from a recent one-year low. The price decline came as crypto exchange Binance came under scrutiny for allegedly assisting sanctioned Russian clients in moving funds abroad. Shiba inu also rose, following recent losses.\n \nBNB\n \nBNB, the native token of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, rose by as much as 4% on Wednesday, following recent declines.\n \nAfter falling to a one-year low of $204.40 on Tuesday, BNB/USD rose to an intraday peak of $216.39 earlier today.\n \nWednesday’s rally in price comes following a recent bear run, which saw the token fall lower for seven of the last nine sessions.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the rally coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rebounding from a floor at 21.00.\n \nAs of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 29.22, which is marginally below a ceiling at 30.00.\n \nIn the event that this ceiling is broken, BNB will likely move above $220.00.\n \n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nAdditionally, shiba inu (SHIB) was also a notable gainer in today’s session, as the meme coin recovered from a recent price dive.\n \nSHIB/USD slipped to a bottom of $0.000007744 during yesterday’s session, before moving to a high of $0.00000832 on hump-day.\n \nThe rebound saw shiba inu rise from Tuesday’s breakout below a key price floor of $0.00000790.\n \n \nLike with BNB above, the move came as the RSI bounced from a floor of its own around the 40.00 mark, with a current reading of 43.92.\n \nAs of now, there is a good chance that SHIB bulls are targeting exits around a resistance point of $0.00000885.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect shiba inu to hit the aforementioned target this week? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.",

          "description": "Bitcoin continued to sit firmly below the $26,000 level on Wednesday, after breaking out of a key price floor. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has mostly consolidated in recent days, as traders await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole this Friday. \n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin moved below a key price floor late on Tuesday, as the cryptocurrency extended its streak of consolidation.\n \nFollowing an earlier high of $26,160.78, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,520.73 late during yesterday’s session.\n \nThis resulted in price diving to a five-day low, and below a recent support point at the $25,600 level.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nAs of writing, bitcoin has since rebounded and is currently trading at $25,870.08, with the relative strength index (RSI) hovering around a floor of its own at 20.00.\n \nPrice strength now sits at 19.82, which remains in the depths of a bear zone, however, it also acts as a positive for longer-term bulls, as sentiment appears to have already found a bottom.\n \nFriday’s Jackson Hole Symposium could provide a spark that markets have been missing in recent days.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) briefly fell under the $1,600 level yesterday. However, price has gone on to recover in today’s session.\n \nETH/USD bottomed out at $1,596.38 on Tuesday, following a peak of $1,662.88 earlier in the day.\n \nSimilar to bitcoin, this drop pushed ethereum to its lowest point since last Thursday, which is when markets reacted to the Spacex news.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \nETH is now trading at $1,637, and comes as the RSI bounced from a support level of 22.00, and has now moved to 23.19.\n \nThe 27.00 mark remains the target for bulls currently in the market, with a collision likely to result in ETH rising above $1,700.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCan ethereum hit $1,700 this week?

It seems likely that the comment was, at least in a way, meant to be derogatory. Perhaps this is because so few people actually understand what Bitcoin even is. Just the mention of cryptocurrency will make the majority of people roll their eyes at the scandal-ridden, casino-like and often-fraudulent topic.
