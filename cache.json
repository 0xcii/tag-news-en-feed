This is a testament to the network congestion that has plagued the blockchain over the past week. So what could be the cause of this backlog?\n \nBitcoin Inscriptions Rear Their Heads Again\n \nEarlier in 2023, the Bitcoin network was lit ablaze when its own version of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) referred to as Inscriptions became the rave of the day. These inscriptions quickly grew in popularity, congesting the network in no time and causing transaction fees to surge.\n \n \nOver the last few months though, the Bitcoin Inscriptions craze seemed to have died down completely and miners were able to return to business as usual.
