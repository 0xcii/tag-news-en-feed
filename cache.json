The company aims to seek shareholders' approval to authorize a $100 million acquisition mandate for purchasing Bitcoin, crypto, and stablecoins within a 12-month period.\nThe proposed mandate outlines the key parameters:\n\nMandate Period: The acquisition mandate spans 12 months post the ordinary resolution's approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nMaximum Amount: An aggregate limit of $100 million has been set, with a specific focus on purchasing BTC, ETH, Tether USD (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC).

The funding will derive from the Group's idle cash reserves.\nAuthorization Scope: The Board will exercise discretion concerning transaction volume, timing, and cryptocurrency selection, conducting acquisitions on licensed trading platforms like HashKey Exchange.\n\nThe company anticipates dispatching a circular to shareholders by November 30, 2023, detailing the mandate's specifics and the proposed acquisitions.",
