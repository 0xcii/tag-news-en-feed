Will transaction fees eventually be able to fill up this void?\n \nBitcoin Transaction Fees Has Been Trending Up With Each Cycle\n \nOne of the most innovative features of the Bitcoin blockchain is that approximately every four years, the block subsidy (that miners receive for solving blocks on the network) is slashed in half. Such events are called the “halving.”\n \nHalvings naturally mean that the miners’ revenues also take a heavy hit, primarily made up of the block rewards. Why does the concept of halving even exist? Well, consider the scenario if there was no halving.\n \nThe block rewards serve as the only way to mint new tokens so that they can be equated to the new production of the asset.

After the collapses of FTX, BlockFi, Celsius and many others, the merit of the “not your keys” mantra is beyond obvious. However, self-custody comes in many forms, and the security properties of a single-seed setup are not that great. That is why advanced bitcoiners should consider upgrading to a Shamir backup.\nWhat is Shamir backup?\nShamir backup is a method for securely splitting a recovery seed while adding an element of redundancy. For example, with Shamir backup it is possible to have a 3-of-5 recovery seed, where the user writes down 5 lists of recovery words, and later needs only 3 of those lists to recover the wallet.

          "description": "Toncoin was a big mover on Thursday, as the token rose by nearly 4%, closing in on the $1.90 level in the process. The rally came despite crypto price consolidation, with the global market cap largely unchanged as of writing. Stellar also surged, remaining near a recent two-week high. \n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin (TON) was one of Thursday’s notable gainers, as price rallied by as much as 4% in today’s session.\n \nFollowing a low of $1.75 on Wednesday, TON/USD rose to a peak of $1.88, earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move comes days after the token reached a high of $2.05, which was the highest point it has hit since May.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the rise in price comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped at a floor of 60.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 63.35, with the next point of resistance around 66.00.\n \nIn the event it moves beyond this level, there is a good chance that price will move back towards $2.00.\n \n \nStellar (XLM)\n \nStellar (XLM) also hovered in the green, as the price remained near a resistance level of $0.1300.\n \nXLM/USD rose to a peak of $0.1243 earlier in the day, which comes following a low of $0.1178 the day prior.\n \nThe move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average approaches an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \n \nIn addition to this, the RSI is on the cusp of breaking out of a key resistance level of 50.00, which has been held for close to a month.\n \nBulls will potentially aim to penetrate this point in the coming days, taking price near a ceiling of $0.1400.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect stellar to rally further this week?
