Since hitting an eleven-month high a week ago, the token has mostly consolidated. Avalanche was also in the green, as prices hit a one-week high.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was a notable gainer in today’s session, as prices continued to move away from a recent support point.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.4972 on Tuesday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.5256 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThis came as bulls continued to move away from a floor at $0.49500, following a breakout earlier in the week.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it appears that this took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a support of its own at 59.00 .\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 61.24, with the next visible ceiling at the 63.00 mark.\n \nAs a result of this upcoming hurdle, earlier bulls have already moved to liquidate gains, with XRP now trading lower at $0.5137.\n \n \nAvalanche (AVAX)\n \nAnother notable gainer on Tuesday was avalanche (AVAX), which moved to a one-week high.\n \nAVAX/USD moved to a peak at $18.31 earlier in today’s session, after falling to a low of $17.29 the day prior.\n \nThe surge saw avalanche climb to its strongest point since March 23, and came following a move beyond a ceiling at $18.00.\n \n \nSince then, earlier gains have somewhat fallen as a result of the RSI hitting a wall at the 56.00 level.\n \nPrice strength is now tracking at 55.63, which has resulted in AVAX once again trading below $18.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect avalanche to move back above $18.00 this week?
