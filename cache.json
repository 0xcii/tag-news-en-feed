Musk tweeted, “Excited to announce that I’ve hired a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks.” Dogecoin neared a two-month low today.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) neared a five-month low on Friday, as markets reacted to the news that Elon Musk will be stepping down as CEO.\n \nMusk, who acquired the social media company last year, has been at the helm since the takeover, but has now found a long-term replacement.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.000008746 on Thursday, SHIB/USD dropped to a bottom of $0.000008549 earlier in the day.\n \n \nAs a result of this sell-off, shiba inu moved close to Monday’s low at $0.00000835, which was the weakest point the meme coin has hit since January.\n \nLooking at the chart, this latest move occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) moved deep into oversold territory, with a current reading at 23.02.\n \nThis does give hope to longer-term bulls however, that a reversal could be on the cards.\n \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) also moved lower in today’s session, as the meme coin neared a multi-month low of its own.\n \nDOGE/USD fell to an intraday low of $0.06957 earlier on Friday, hours after trading at a peak of $0.07268.\n \nSimilar to SHIB, today’s decline almost led to dogecoin recapturing a low of $0.0692, which was its weakest level since March.\n \n \nDOGE has since bounced back from this earlier low, after bulls rejected a full breakout of a support point of $0.07000.\n \nAs of writing, the price is now at $0.07127, which seems to have occurred as traders moved to buy the dip.\n \nShould today’s low be the hard floor, there will likely be a stronger rebound in the coming days.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould DOGE climb towards $0.08000 next week?
