Amid this whirlwind, both gold and silver have enjoyed a surge, paralleling the ascent of the crypto world. In contrast, equities have faced a challenging week, with the Dow Jones plummeting over 200 points just ahead of Friday’s closing bell.\n \nGold Stands Firm in Macroeconomic Turmoil\n \nOn October 20, the quartet of leading stock indices — Dow Jones (DJI), S&P 500 (INX), Nasdaq Composite (IXIC), and the Russell 2000 (RUT) — witnessed declines ranging from 0.8% to 1.5%.

This has been the topic of the week, with many speculating how high crypto markets could surge on such potential news. Ethereum slipped from Friday’s peak.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin was hovering marginally below the $30,000 level on Saturday as a section of bulls looked to seize this week’s profits.\n \nFollowing a peak at $30,104.09 on Friday, BTC/USD has fallen to a current low of $29,816.64 during today’s session.\n \nDespite the decline, the world’s largest cryptocurrency remains higher than yesterday’s low at the $29,376.12 mark.\n \n \nThe easing of momentum comes as the relative strength index (RSI) continued its stay in overbought territory, with a present reading of 73.17.\n \nThis is the highest point the index has tracked at since February, giving some traders concerns of a potential pullback.\n \nShould this occur in the coming days, bears will likely look to push bitcoin to the $29,000 level, which seems to be the next visible floor.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) also edged lower to start the weekend, however remains above the $1,600 level.\n \nETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,593.45 earlier in the day, however bulls then pushed price to a high of $1,610.11.\n \nOverall, ethereum traders appear to still be targeting its long-term floor of $1,650, with today’s decline a possible pitstop towards this point.\n \n \nUnlike bitcoin above, ETH’s price strength has yet to climb into the overbought mark, and is currently tracking at 51.76.\n \nThis is slightly above a ceiling at 50.00, with the next firm resistance point around the 60.00 region.\n \nIn the event bulls push for this point, ethereum will almost certainly be trading above $1,650.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect ethereum to end the month above $1,650?
