Notably, Xverse wallet recently secured a $5 million funding round led by Jump Capital, with participation from BTC Inc.’s 2140 fund and financial heavyweight Franklin Templeton.\nApplications for the Ordinals accelerator are now open via the Bitcoin Frontier Fund's website.

The move comes despite the global market cap mostly trading lower to start the week, falling 0.23% as of writing. Dogecoin fell for a second straight session.\n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nChainlink snapped a four-day losing streak on Monday, despite the global market cap mostly tracking lower to start the week.\n \nFollowing a low of $7.32 on Sunday, LINK/USD jumped to a peak of $7.54 earlier in today’s session.\n \nMonday’s move sees chainlink edge closer to a key resistance level of $7.65, which was last truly broken on July 30.\n \n \nIn addition to this, an upward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages looks imminent.\n \nShould this occur, there is a strong possibility that chainlink may not only move past the aforementioned ceiling, but closer to the $8.00 level.\n \nAt the time of writing, LINK is tracking at $7.49.\n \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nOn the other side of the spectrum, dogecoin moved lower for a second straight session, following last week’s bull run.\n \nDOGE/USD fell to a low of $0.07409 to start the week, following an earlier high of $0.07615 the day prior.\n \nSince peaking at a multi-week high of $0.0776 on Saturday, dogecoin has mostly traded in the red, which appears to be largely due to profit taking.\n \n \nThis spell of bearish pressure looks to be pushing price towards a key support level around the $0.0730 region.\n \nIn addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovered close to its own floor, at the 50.00 mark.\n \nCurrently, price strength is tracking at 50.35, with the meme coin now trading at $0.07458.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould dogecoin move higher in the coming days?
