          "description": "Binance coin was one of Monday’s biggest gainers, as the token rebounded following a move close to a key support point on Sunday. The move pushed the price near a one-week high, and came as the global crypto market cap fell 0.07% lower as of writing. Solana also dropped, following a recent bull run.\n \nBinance Coin (BNB)\n \nBinance coin (BNB) was a notable gainer on Monday, as the token rose by nearly 5% to start the trading week.\n \nAfter falling to an intraday low of $232.01 earlier in today’s session, BNB/USD rose to a peak of $244.80.\n \nThis resulted in BNB hitting its strongest point since last Tuesday, when the token climbed to a high of $246.90.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that this latest rally occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 48.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 49.33, with the next visible point of resistance at 52.00.\n \nShould the index reach this point, there is a good chance that BNB will be near $250.00.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nAfter climbing to a two-month high last week, solana (SOL) was in the red on Monday, falling for a second straight day.\n \nSOL/USD hit an intraday low of $20.57, which comes less than 24 hours after price peaked at $21.53.\n \nThe move appears to be a result of profit taking, since solana reached its highest point since May 6, this past Saturday.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it seems that sentiment is still somewhat bullish, as traders opted to reject a breakout below $20.00.\n \nAs of writing, the token is trading at $21.09, with the 10-day (red) moving average still upward facing.\n \nOverall, the recent decline comes following a collision with a ceiling at $22.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould solana move back above $22.00 in the coming days?

          "description": "In a recent newsletter, Singapore-based crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital raised the question of whether the introduction of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could lead to price manipulation by institutions, similar to what has happened in the gold market. The bitcoin spot ETF filing by BlackRock and many other institutional giants has created a lot of euphoria in the market, but the manipulation issue has not been addressed much.\n \nAccording to QCP Capital, “Just like BTC, gold is seen as a competitor to the dollar, especially ever since Nixon removed the dollar from the gold standard in 1971. Having full control of gold allows institutions to defend the dollar, especially if they have various vested interests in protecting the greenback.”\n \n \nWeb3 Watch – 10 Jul 23\n \nIt’s out! In…",

Inflation is expected to drop to 3.1% in June, which would be a nearly two-year low. Ethereum also slipped on Monday, remaining below $1,900.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) started the week trading near the $30,000 level, after the price dropped below this point over the weekend.\n \nFollowing a low of $29,985.39 on Sunday, BTC/USD jumped to an intraday high of $30,427.59 in today’s session.\n \nThe rebound comes as bears rejected a breakout below a recent support point at the $29,900 level.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nBTC has mostly been consolidating for the past four days, which has led to the 10-day (red) moving average shifting direction.\n \nAfter trending upwards in recent weeks, the moving average now looks as though it has flatlined, giving way to a potential downturn in the coming days.\n \nIn addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 57.75, marginally below a ceiling at 58.00.\n \nShould it fail to break out, there is a good chance that BTC could decline further in the coming days.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) continued to trade below $1,900 on Monday, as price is nearly 5% lower than at the same point last week.\n \nETH/USD slid to an intraday bottom at $1,848.78 to start the week, a day after trading nearly $30.00 higher.\n \nOverall, this has resulted in ethereum’s 10-day (red) moving average closing in on a downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nShould this occur, the first possible target will be a price floor at $1,815, which was last hit on June 30.\n \nPrice strength is currently at a reading of 50.35, however should it move under an upcoming floor at 48.00, a sell-off will likely occur.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nIs this recent downturn a result of profit taking?
