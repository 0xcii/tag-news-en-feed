According to a spokesperson for France’s Financial Prosecutor’s Office (PNF), the preliminary investigation into four French banks and one international bank began at the end of 2021.\n \nCum-Ex Scheme at the Center of the Investigation; Societe Generale Confirms Involvement in the Raids\n \nAmid the banking crisis plaguing the industry in the United States and abroad, French enforcement authorities on Tuesday raided the offices of several major banks, including HSBC, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas, Natixis, and Exane. The PNF prosecution office noted that the raids were based on suspicion of money laundering and fiscal fraud.\n \n“The ongoing operations, which have required several months of preparation, are being carried out by 16 investigating judges and over 150 investigative agents,” the PNF said in a statement. The raids are tied to an alleged dividend arbitrage scheme known as “cum-cum” or “cum-ex” practices. The practice involves splitting dividends temporarily in order to avoid dividend taxes.\n \n \nReportedly, the practice is leveraged by the banks’ wealthy clients to avoid taxation on dividend accounts. The PNF also disclosed that six German prosecutors were involved in the case. The PNF and collaborating prosecutors believe that the alleged fraud has cost governments $108 billion. According to a report by CNBC, Societe Generale was the only financial institution to confirm the office raids. A spokesperson for Societe Generale told The Telegraph that the bank is “part of the investigation.”\n \nWhat are your thoughts on the alleged $108 billion fraud by five major banks?

While it has faced its fair share of controversies, it has also opened up new possibilities and transformed the financial sector. With the rise of cryptocurrency, there has been a surge in the number of exchanges that facilitate the buying and selling of digital assets; with the fall of FTX, traders have become more aware of whether their digital assets are within their own key, boosting the popularity of decentralized exchanges.

In February 2023, Bitcoin.com News reported that SBF’s indictment was revised to include bank fraud charges. SBF faces other charges as well, including defrauding the Federal Election Commission (FEC), wire fraud, and securities fraud. The former FTX CEO has pleaded not guilty to the charges, but three of the firm’s top deputies have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with federal prosecutors.\n \n \nThe revised filing indicates that Chinese officials reportedly seized two accounts owned by Alameda Research, SBF’s quantitative trading arm, which were allegedly held on “two of China’s largest crypto exchanges” in 2021. Once again, the revised indictment does not include any other defendants, and Sam Bankman-Fried is the only individual named.\n \nWith the addition of bank fraud charges last month and newly added bribery charges, SBF now faces a total of 13 charges from the Department of Justice in New York. He also faces lawsuits filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n \nWhat do you think about the new charges SBF faces?

The token moved to its highest point since November, which comes despite a red wave sweeping over cryptocurrency markets. The global market cap is down 2.35% as of writing.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, rose for a fourth consecutive session on Monday, as prices hit their highest point in five months.\n \nXRP/USD surged to an intraday high at $0.5029, less than 24 hours after falling to a low of $0.4573.\n \nAs a result of the move, XRP hit its strongest point since November 6, breaking out of a ceiling at $0.4950 in the process.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved to a one-week high, with a current reading of 68.87.\n \nThis is marginally below resistance at 69.00, and close to a recent seven-month high at 74.00.\n \nEarlier gains in XRP have already begun to ease, with bulls seemingly securing gains around this ceiling.\n \n \nMonero (XMR)\n \nDuring today’s red wave, monero (XMR) was a notable token to fall, as prices moved to a five-day low.\n \nFollowing a high of $163.98 to start the week, XMR/USD slipped to a bottom at $149.85 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe drop sees monero fall by as much as 7%, edging closer to a long-term support point at $146.00 in the process.\n \n \nWhilst price has yet to reach this floor, the RSI collided with a support point of its own at the 49.00 mark.\n \nBulls have since pushed the index higher, with price strength now tracking at 50.08, which comes as XMR moved away from earlier lows.\n \nCurrently, monero is tracking at $154.03, with a move towards a ceiling at $156.00 a strong possibility.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect monero to move higher in upcoming days?
