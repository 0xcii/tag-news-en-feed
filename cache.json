This isn’t an isolated event; platforms such as Binance, Deribit, Bitget, and Okx are also experiencing significant upticks.\n \nBitcoin’s Futures Landscape Heats Up\n \nFor those new to the term, in bitcoin futures, open interest (OI) represents market engagement and the volume of money or contracts actively circulating.

          "description": "So a lot of noise has been made around the Lightning vulnerability recently disclosed by Antoine Riard. Many people are claiming the sky is falling, that Lightning is fundamentally broken, and nothing could be further from the truth. I think part of the problem is that people don't really understand how this vulnerability works, firstly, and secondly many people don't understand how this individual vulnerability overlaps with other known issues on the Lightning Network that have known solutions. \nSo first, let's go through and try to understand the vulnerability itself. When a Lightning payment is routed across the network, one thing that is key to understand is how the timelocks for refunding a failed payment work. The hop closest to the receiver has a timelock of 'x', and every hop going…",
