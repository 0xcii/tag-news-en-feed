          "description": "Following a claim from an individual asserting they had lost 139 bitcoin in a hack, where 83.65 BTC was utilized as a heightened fee to expedite its mining, Antpool has disclosed its readiness to reimburse the mistakenly paid fee. Antpool specified on November 30 that the individual has a deadline of December 10, 2023, to reclaim the fee from the mining pool. \n \nDeadline Announced by Antpool for Refunding Massive Bitcoin Transaction Fee in Suspected Hack Case\n \nRecently, the cryptocurrency community observed an exceptionally large transaction fee, where 83.65 BTC, valued at over $3 million, was remitted to miners. This transaction, confirmed in block 818,087, was processed by Antpool, today’s most dominant mining pool by hashrate. Following this event, an unidentified user on the social media platform X disclosed that this fee originated from their bitcoin holdings, which were allegedly compromised by hackers.\n \nThe user also provided a signature, verifying their claim by signing a message with the private keys of the address. On November 30, Antpool issued a statement regarding the erroneously paid fee, declaring its readiness to refund the owner of the address. “On November 23rd, some user submitted 83 BTC as a gas fee,” Antpool disclosed. “The risk control system of Antpool temporarily froze the fee when packaging the transaction.”\n \n\nPlease contact us before 00:00 (UTC+8) on December 10, 2023 and verify personal identity in the following way. After verification, Antpool will refund the fee.\n \n \nConfirming the user’s identity could be crucial for Antpool, as there’s a prevailing notion that the hacker might still possess the key, and the alleged victim might actually be the perpetrator. The user is required to sign the address and forward it to Antpool’s email for verification purposes.\n \nWhat do you think about Antpool detailing that it would refund the massive fee it mined?

Virtual asset valuation losses contributed to the 81.6% drop in the operator’s net profit for the period. \n \nOperating Profit Down by Nearly 40%\n \nIn the third quarter (Q3) of 2023, Dunamu, the operator of the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit, reportedly realized an operating profit of just over $79 million (101.8 billion won). According to a Decenter report, Dunamu’s Q3 operating profit is nearly 40% lower than the $130.9 million realized in the corresponding period in 2022.\n \nSimilarly, Dunamu’s Q3 revenue, which stood at approximately $150 million, is 29% lower than the $211 million realized in the same period last year. Also, the crypto exchange operator’s Q3 net profit of $22.9 million is reportedly 81.6% lower than in the same period last year.\n \n\n \nAs per the report, Dunamu’s net profit for the period is lower due to so-called virtual asset valuation losses.\n \nMeanwhile, the report revealed that Dunamu is now working on finding ways to mitigate the effects of the recession in the virtual assets market. An unnamed company official suggested that Dunamu is hoping to achieve this by pursuing new business opportunities.\n \n“We will strive to revitalize the blockchain ecosystem and create an advanced investment environment, and do our best to provide innovative services based on Dunamu’s unique technological capabilities,” the unnamed official said.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
