During these events, the rate at which new Bitcoin is created through mining is reduced, resulting in a reduction in the asset's issuance.\nAs alluded by Zhao, this supply shock has historically had a significant impact on the price of Bitcoin, resulting in all-time highs in 2013, 2017, and 2021.\nZhao's remarks on the potential for \"all-time highs\" following the 2024 Bitcoin halving are grounded in historical trends.
