          "description": "The Blockchain Association, a nonprofit organization advocating for pro-innovation policies in relation to Bitcoin, has called for an investigation into the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its approval of Prometheum Ember Capital as a Special Purpose Broker Dealer (SPBD). In a letter to the Inspector General of the SEC, the association raises concerns about potential impropriety and ethical issues surrounding the approval process.\n\n\n\nThe letter highlights the lack of regulatory clarity regarding how U.S. securities laws apply to digital assets and criticizes SEC Chair Gary Gensler, accusing the SEC of overt hostility towards the digital assets industry while citing enforcement actions and proposed rulemaking that have impacted the sector. The approval of Prometheum as an SPBD is seen as concerning, as other companies with what the letter describes as \"legitimate business models\" have faced denials or delays in obtaining similar licenses.\nThe letter states Prometheum's license approval comes at a time when the company has no working product or assets, raising further questions. The association questions whether Prometheum received preferential treatment or leveraged personal connections to gain an unfair advantage. They express concern that SEC Chair Gensler is using Prometheum and the SPBD licensure process to impede congressional efforts towards legislation and promote what it views as a false narrative, that the law is clear regarding digital asset securities. “There's no question Prometheum is hiding something on its SEC relationship,” said Dan Spuller, head of industry affairs at the Association. \nThe Blockchain Association has submitted a request to the SEC under the Freedom of Information Act, seeking documents and communications related to the matter. They urge the opening of an investigation to address these concerns and provide clarity. The outcome of the investigation will determine whether there was any impropriety or validate the inferences made by the association.",

          "description": "On July 12, 2023, onchain data shows the U.S. government transferred 9,800 bitcoins (BTC), worth just over $300 million. These bitcoins originally came from James Zhong’s Silk Road hack. In March, the Department of Justice also moved a similar amount of bitcoins associated with Silk Road.\n \nSilk Road Bitcoin Stash Controlled by the Feds Moves, Funds Reportedly Sent to Coinbase\n \nAbout 9,800 BTC from Silk Road was moved in two transactions on Wednesday, reportedly sent to wallets controlled by Coinbase. At the time of writing, the funds held by the U.S. government are worth $302 million, based on the day’s BTC exchange rates.\n \nThe bitcoins came from James Zhong, the convicted Silk Road hacker. At the time of his arrest, federal authorities seized about 51,351.89785803 bitcoins on three separate occasions, along with a collection of precious metals and $661,900 in cash.\n \n \n🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔\n8999.90799037 #BTC sent by #US_DEPARTMENT_OF_JUSTICE (Seizure – James Zhong Via Silk Road Exploit)\n🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔\n \n️ https://t.co/r4wif5icol\n \n— OXTObserver (@OXTObserver) July 12, 2023\n \n\n \nLast March, the government sold 9,861 bitcoins for just over $200 million. The onchain activity four months prior was also detected by onchain observers and blockchain parsers. It’s speculated that all the BTC transferred from Zhong’s stash has been sold on Coinbase.\n \n \nThe selling through Coinbase is unusual as the U.S. government typically auctions off BTC with assistance from the U.S. Marshals. For example, bitcoins seized from Ross Ulbricht in the Silk Road case were auctioned, with investors like Tim Draper purchasing some of the coins. Only recently has the government started moving cryptocurrency to spot exchanges.\n \nWhat do you think about the feds sending a large stash of bitcoin on Wednesday?
