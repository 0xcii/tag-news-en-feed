Markets surged after data in China showed that consumer prices had hit an 18-month low. Ethereum was also higher on the news, moving closer to $2,000. \n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) raced above $30,000 for the first time in ten months, as markets reacted to the latest inflation data from China.\n \nConsumer prices in China rose by 0.7% in March, which is the slowest increase since September 2021.\n \nFollowing a low of $28,189.27 to start the week, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $30,160.48 earlier today.\n \n \nThis move saw bitcoin climb to its strongest point since June 9, and comes as the 10-day (red) moving average avoided a downward cross with its 24-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nIn addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) moved above a key resistance point of 68.00, and is currently tracking at 71.05.\n \nThe next visible ceiling appears to be at the 73.00 mark, and as a result, bulls may begin to secure profits, slowly vacating earlier positions.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) was also back in the green on Tuesday, with prices once again trading above $1,900.\n \nETH/USD hit a peak of $1,936.73 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,848.16.\n \nAs a result of Tuesday’s surge in price, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency neared its highest point since last August.\n \nLooking at the chart, today’s move coincided with the RSI breaking out of a ceiling at the 61.00 mark.\n \n \nAt the time of writing, price strength is at a reading of 64.04, with an upcoming resistance point at 65.00.\n \nShould ETH move beyond this point, there is a good chance that ETH will move back above $2,000.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill ethereum move to $2,000 this week?

          "description": "PRESS RELEASE. The Seasonal Tokens economy has gone through its second change of season. Like bitcoin, the four tokens – Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter – go through regular halvings of the supply from mining. Every nine months, the rate of production of one of the tokens is cut in half. On the 6th of March, the Summer halving took place. Summer went from being produced at the fastest rate of the four tokens, to the slowest.\n \nAs the market adjusts to the lower rate of supply after a halving, the token that was previously the cheapest gradually becomes the most expensive. This happened with Spring after its halving in June of last year. The same process is now unfolding with Summer. Autumn tokens, which are now produced at the fastest rate of the four, have become the cheapest token, and…",
