In January, the SEC approved several US spot bitcoin ETFs, which attracted over $200 billion in volume within just three months. \nMeanwhile, Hong Kong's first spot bitcoin ETF is set to begin trading tomorrow after receiving regulatory approval last week.\nThe success of spot bitcoin ETFs in these major financial hubs has prompted Australia to follow suit.
