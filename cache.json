          "description": "The battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs over the regulatory status of XRP took a dramatic turn last week. The latest powerplay? A Hail Mary interlocutory appeal from the authority. The agency tried appealing a past court decision allowing Ripple to use a “fair notice” defense. However, prominent lawyers vehemently oppose this, predicting its inevitable rejection.\n \nRipple’s chief counsel, James K. Filan, and Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal already called the SEC’s bluff.
