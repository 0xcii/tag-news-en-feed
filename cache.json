          "description": "Have you ever looked at the stars and noticed how everything in the universe seems connected? Famous inventor and engineer, Nikola Tesla, thought that this connection is all about energy, how often things vibrate, and the way they move. I believe that as well; our perceptions of every aspect of life can be perceived as a transfer of energy, a simple equation. Let's take a moment to view the seemingly random interactions in the world as their own version of an energy transaction. The following analogies are different ways to help us think about energy, especially how we use it and share it while also respecting nature's wisdom. Then, of course, we’ll circle back to how this all relates to understanding how Bitcoin fits into… dare I say “fixes”… this.\nFocusing on the internal, energy flows i…",
