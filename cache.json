          "description": "The Ethereum price has been on a seesaw motion in the past few weeks, oscillating between the $2,500 and $2,750 zone. The altcoin struggled to make a mark in the past week, as its value fell to as low as $2,400 at some point.\n \nWhile the price performance of the Ether token has been uninspiring in recent months, an analyst has put forward an argument to support the position that the second-largest cryptocurrency might still be in a bullish trend. \n \nHere’s Why The ETH Price Never Stopped Being Bullish\n \nIn a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Crypto Sunmoon made an interesting claim about the Ethereum price.
