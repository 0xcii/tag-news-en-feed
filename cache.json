In a statement, a spokesman for the firm acknowledged the launch date, making it one of the first companies to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong.\nOSL, a digital asset platform that acts as a sub-custodian and infrastructure service provider for two major fund managers, has also indicated that spot bitcoin products aim to launch as early as late April. This news further solidifies Hong Kong's position as a frontrunner in the race to offer investors access to Bitcoin through traditional financial instruments.\nElsewhere, some of China's top asset managers are in the final leg of preparations for the spot Bitcoin ETFs to begin trading potentially by the end of April. \nThis development is expected to attract significant interest from investors within and outside Hong Kong.\n \n                         \n                         \n                        Click the image to learn more. \n                     \n                    \nAccording to predictions by Singapore-based crypto services provider Matrixport and Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, Hong Kong Spot Bitcoin ETFs could bring in and unlock up to $25 billion in new demand. \nThis influx of capital could have a profound impact on Bitcoin and further legitimize it as an asset class.",

A recent analysis by CryptoQuant, a blockchain analytics firm, paints a picture of a changing investor landscape, with a new breed of “whales” – high-volume crypto holders – entering the fray and established players holding their ground.\n \n \nThis influx of fresh capital is significant.
