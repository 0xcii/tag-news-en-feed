As of writing, the global crypto market cap is trading 0.20% lower, however the meme coin is up by nearly 5%. Apecoin also surged in today’s session, as it rose to its strongest point since November.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) was one of Tuesday’s notable gainers, as prices of the token rose for a sixth straight session.\n \nSHIB/USD surged to an high of $0.000009593 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $0.000008603.\n \nAs a result of this latest surge in price, shiba inu climbed to its highest point since December 5.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears as though today’s rally came following an upwards crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.\n \nIn addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has risen above a recent ceiling at 65.50.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 67.50, with the next visible ceiling at the 73.00 zone.\n \n \nApecoin (APE)\n \nApecoin (APE) was another big mover in today’s session, extending recent gains to a fifth consecutive day.\n \nFollowing a low of $4.50 to start the week, APE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $4.98 earlier in the day.\n \nThe move pushed apecoin to its highest level since November 5, and came following a breakout of a price ceiling at $4.60.\n \n \nAs a result of today’s surge, the RSI on the APE chart is now at its strongest point on record, with a reading of 79.09.\n \nThis means that prices are now deep in overbought territory, which could mean that bears are preparing for reentry.\n \nDespite this potential reversal, bulls are seemingly still targeting a ceiling at $5.30, which hasn’t been hit since October 11.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould apecoin rally to hit $5.30 during the month of January?
