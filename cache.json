          "description": "Bitcoin is trading at $30,000 today, up more than $5,000 in around a week since retesting 25,000 support.\n \nMore important than the psychological level itself is the fact the push above $30,000 has turned momentum on monthly price charts bullish for the first time since August 2021. In addition, price is back above a dynamic technical resistance level that has prevented a bull run for several months. With that out of the way, crypto could soar.\n \nBitcoin Above $30,000 Triggers Bullish Crossover\n \nAs some analysts predicted, Bitcoin is indeed following stocks with a potential bull market breakout. The last several days of upside have resulted in a revisit to above $30,000. Price action is now attempting to establish support above the key level.\n \n \nThe more than 6% intraday increase in BTCUSD has triggered a potential bullish crossover on the LMACD. The crossover is the first green tick on the LMACD since it turned red in August 2021.\n \nA bullish crossover occurs when the LMACD line crosses the signal line from below. However, the crossover requires a monthly close to confirm, and several monthly closes for a full confidence signal.\n \n\n \n \nBollinger Band Signal Confluence Could Target $50,000 Next\n \nTechnical analysts often look for a confluence of signals. For example, a morning star Japanese candlestick reversal pattern is more noteworthy when at support and the RSI is oversold.\n \n \nThe chart above shows that not only is Bitcoin flirting with $30,000 resistance, it is also at the monthly Bollinger Band basis line. And all this is happening with the aforementioned bullish crossover of the monthly LMACD.\n \nWith BTCUSD above the monthly “mid-BB”, the next logical target would be the upper Bollinger Band. This is currently located above $50,000 per BTC. Historically, after crossing bullish and making it over the median, Bitcoin ultimately tagged the upper hand in the months that followed. Is this time going to be different? Or is the next stop $50,000 per coin?",

A Delaware-based subsidiary of Valkyrie Investments Inc. has filed an updated spot ETF proposal, altering the intended exchange to Nasdaq and changing the ticker to $BRRR.\nThe company, which already has a bitcoin futures ETF product listed on the Nasdaq, is likely to have been closely observing the developments in the industry, with a particular focus on other firms entering the ETF market. Notably, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, filed a spot bitcoin ETF application, perhaps taking advantage of recent regulatory scrutiny to facilitate its entry into the market. This move by BlackRock, a prominent player in traditional finance, indicates the growing acceptance and interest in bitcoin among institutional investors.\nFurthermore, WisdomTree, an asset management company, has also submitted an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. This application signals the increasing competition among firms aiming to launch bitcoin ETFs, as they recognize the demand for regulated investment products in the space, along with the first-movers advantage possible.\nIn addition, Bitwise filed a 19b-4 form to renew their spot bitcoin ETF filing, while Invesco renewed their filing for a spot bitcoin ETF.\nAs firms like Valkyrie, BlackRock, Bitwise, Invesco and WisdomTree enter the race for an ETF approval, they all equally aim to provide investors with more accessible and regulated avenues to participate in the bitcoin market. These developments underscore the continued growth and maturation of the bitcoin industry, with ETFs emerging as an important tool for investors seeking exposure to bitcoin in a regulated manner, albeit at the cost of certain properties inherent only to native bitcoin.",
