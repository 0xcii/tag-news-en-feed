Once integrated, merchants in the sector will be able to employ them to expand their user base by connecting to Paypal’s payments system.\n \nPaypal Launches On- and Off-Ramps for Web3 Payments\n \nPayments giant Paypal revealed on Monday it’s moving to further increase access to crypto by offering wallets, decentralized apps (dapps) and marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) a simple solution to enable their customers to buy and sell supported cryptocurrencies in the U.S.\n \nThis can be achieved through an integration with the Paypal On and Off Ramps, subject to applicable state laws, the company said, adding:\n \n\nOnce integrated, Web3 merchants can help grow their user base by connecting to Paypal’s fast and seamless payments experience trusted by millions, while leveraging Paypal’s robust security controls and tools for fraud management, chargebacks and disputes.\n \n \nThe fintech firm reminded that it previously launched its on-ramps to enable consumers in the United States to directly buy crypto assets with Paypal through integrations with the Metamask and Ledger wallets.\n \nAdding off-ramps will now allow crypto wallet holders in the United States to directly convert cryptocurrencies to U.S. dollars into their Paypal balance and then use the money to shop, send, save, or transfer to their bank or debit card.\n \nPaypal’s off-ramps solution is already live on Metamask, the press release noted. Last week, the popular Ethereum wallet introduced a “Sell” option allowing users in the U.S., the U.K., and some European markets to cash out ether (ETH) to major fiat currencies and have the amount sent to a bank account or a Paypal balance.\n \nDo you think Paypal will continue to expand crypto payment services for Web3 businesses?
