          "description": "Bitcoin edged lower once again on Thursday, as traders continued to capture profits following gains on Tuesday. The latest drop followed data revealing U.S. gross domestic product growth in the second quarter that undershot expectations. Ethereum likewise declined, dipping under $1,700.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin was in the red for a second consecutive session, as a mixture of profit-taking and general bearish sentiment impacted price.\n \nFollowing a peak of $27,490.77 on hump day, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,069.21 earlier today.\n \nThe sell-off comes a few days removed from bitcoin moving above $28,000, following Grayscale’s court win against the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC).\n \n \nOn a technical note, the decline coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failing to move beyond its ceiling at 53.00.\n \nAs of writing this, the index is now tracking at a reading of 47.50, with the next visible floor at the 43.00 level.\n \nShould momentum push price strength to this point, there is a good chance that the price will drop below $27,000.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nAdditionally, ethereum (ETH) was back in the red on Thursday, with price falling below the $1,700 level.\n \nETH/USD dropped to the bottom of $1,697.15 earlier in the day, which comes following a high of $1,721.62 the day prior.\n \nLike with bitcoin, the decline appears to be a result of profit-taking, after ethereum surged to a multi-week high on Tuesday.\n \n \nIn order for bulls to maintain the momentum from earlier in the week, a breakout will need to occur at the 49.00 level on the RSI.\n \nPrice strength is now tracking at 45.65, with price back above $1,700.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill momentum continue to climb in the coming days?
