CEO David Bailey praised Ordinals for unlocking \"a whole new wave of technical advancement on Bitcoin that was previously deemed impossible.\"\nDespite recent NFT market fluctuations, investments in Ordinals infrastructure are rising. Notably, Xverse wallet recently secured a $5 million funding round led by Jump Capital, with participation from BTC Inc.’s 2140 fund and financial heavyweight Franklin Templeton.\nApplications for the Ordinals accelerator are now open via the Bitcoin Frontier Fund's website. The fund aims to finalize its next Ordinals investments by Q4 2023, charting a transformative path for Bitcoin's future through the Ordinals protocol.",
