He postulates, “Wallets don’t last forever. They are often compromised or lost. When this happens, the addresses generated from those wallets become a form of toxic data: funds sent to those addresses can be easily lost forever.”\n \n \n #Bitcoin Update: @peterktodd suggests adding user-set expiration dates to $BTC addresses for silent payments. pic.twitter.com/zI…",
