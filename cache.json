Between Jan. 23, 2023, and the date of their appointment, liquidators claimed to have recovered approximately $770,000 which belonged to MTI. \n \nLiquidators’ Fees\n \nLiquidators of the collapsed bitcoin Ponzi scheme Mirror Trading International (MTI) have so far spent approximately $4.9 million (90.2 million rands) on lawyers and consultants since assuming control, a report has said. According to a Mybroadband report, a total of approximately $6.1 million has so far been disbursed while a further $7.3 million is earmarked for liquidators’ fees.\n \nIn April 2021, a Bitcoin.com News report said more than $70 million was raised from selling 1,281 bitcoins belonging to MTI. A few months later, another report said more than 8,000 BTC belonging to MTI had been “traced” and that investigators were on track to finding more.\n \n \nHowever, according to the report, between Jan.23 and the day they took control of MTI assets, liquidators have so far recovered around $770,000. While liquidators are said to be expecting an “exponential increase in the amount recovered from the so-called net winners,” they are less certain about the growth rate of their expenditure.\n \nAccording to the blockchain intelligence firm, Chainalysis, MTI was the biggest crypto scam in 2020 which netted more than $500 million for the scheme’s masterminds.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

          "description": "The Bitcoin hardware company has begun manufacturing its own chip wrapper for the Trezor Model T.\nTrezor, a Prague-based Bitcoin hardware company, has announced that it has taken control of its silicon chip supply chain.\nAccording to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the company has achieved this by facilitating the manufacture of its own key component, the chip wrapper, for its flagship product, the Trezor Model T. The new chip wrapper “improves device security and significantly shortens lead times for mass production,” the release states.\nWith the silicon chip supply chain under constant geopolitical pressure, securing the manufacturing of this important component is a source of confidence in the ability for Trezor to continue producing its products. \nŠtěpán Uherik, CFO at Trezor, commented that “The twists and turns in demand for hardware wallets and the silicon supply chain disruption that we’ve seen over the past few years was a problem that we needed to solve. By unpacking the process, identifying areas where we could take control, and collaborating with our partners in new ways, we’ve managed to make the manufacturing as agile as it can be.” \nHe added that “It also adds more design freedom for future products, helping us to sustain our leadership in the increasingly competitive hardware wallet space.” \nSatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor, also announced last year the development of an open-source chip for usage in Bitcoin hardware. Just recently, the company detailed that the initial testing on the first chip, TROPIC01, had been completed, with expectations of continued testing throughout 2023.",
