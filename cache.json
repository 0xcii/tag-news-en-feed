The firm informed its U.S. clientele that they could “withdraw and transfer” their funds to a different wallet.\n \nWallet of Satoshi Halts U.S. Operations\n \nA recent update on X (previously known as Twitter) revealed that Wallet of Satoshi (WoS), headquartered in Australia, is ceasing operations in the United States. WoS, an application available on iOS and Android, enables users to manage bitcoin (BTC) and Lightning Network transactions. Daniel Alexiuc established the company in 2018.\n \nThe announcement from WoS expressed, “We’ve made the difficult decision to remove our app from the U.S. Apple and Google app stores, and will not serve U.S. customers going forward.” The statement emphasized, “This decision doesn’t come lightly. Our commitment to providing a secure, user-friendly, and compliant platform globally is unwavering. Our top priority is the safety and interests of our customers and our company.”\n \nFurther, the WoS statement mentioned:\n \n\nWe understand this may be disappointing news and we share your frustration. We’re hopeful that future developments will allow us to revisit and possibly resume our operations in the U.S.\n \n \nThis move coincides with what was shaping up to be a record-breaking month for WoS, as observed by Kevin Rooke. “Wallet of Satoshi is on pace to process over 1.1 million Lightning payments in November,” stated Rooke two days prior. He attributed the surge in transactions this month largely to effective Lightning advertising.\n \nWhat do you think about the Wallet of Satoshi leaving the U.S. and pulling its apps from the Google Play and Apple App Store?

The extradition bids originate from both the United States and South Korea, with the final determination of Kwon’s destination resting in the hands of the court’s Justice Minister.\n \nJudge Will Decide on Do Kwon’s Extradition\n \nThe notorious Do Kwon is poised for extradition upon completing his sentence in Montenegro, though his ultimate destination remains uncertain. A recent press release reveals that South Korea seeks Kwon for engaging in fraudulent and unfair trading activities. Additionally, the U.S. also desires his extradition for similar infractions, including securities fraud and market manipulation.\n \nAccording to the press release, Kwon agreed to be extradited to South Korea. However, the court noted that due to multiple extradition requests, the Podgorica High Court must make the final determination. “The final decision on the matter will be made by the Minister of Justice of Montenegro,” the announcement specifies.\n \n \nThe announcement from the Podgorica High Court further clarifies, “If the Minister of Justice allows the final extradition of the aforementioned accused, the extradition will be executed after the completion of the criminal sentence imposed by the Basic Court in Podgorica in a case against the same individual for the criminal offense of document forgery.”\n \nWhat do you think about Do Kwon being extradited? What nation state do you think he will be sent to? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.",
