          "description": "Tron was one of the notable movers on Saturday, as the token broke out of a key resistance level to start the weekend. The move came as the global crypto market cap mostly consolidated during Saturday’s session. Stellar was another exception, as the token rebounded from yesterday’s loss.\n \nTron (TRX)\n \nTron (TRX) was a notable gainer to start the weekend, with the price surging to a 20-month high.\n \nAfter dropping to a low of $0.08035 on Friday, TRX/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $0.09317 earlier in the day.\n \nThis was the highest point tron has hit since December 2021, and comes following a breakout of a ceiling at $0.08600.\n \n \nThis coincides with the relative strength index (RSI) moving past its own ceiling at 70.00. It is now tracking at 71.35.\n \nEarlier gains have since faded, with the token now back below the aforementioned resistance level of $0.08600.\n \nThis appears to be a result of traders capturing profits.\n \n \nStellar (XLM)\n \nIn addition to TRX, stellar was also largely in the green on Saturday, as the token rebounded from Friday’s losses.\n \nXLM/USD rose to a high of $0.1674 to start the weekend, which comes a day after trading at a low of $0.1561.\n \nThis rally resulted in stellar breaking out of a recent resistance level of $0.1620, and edging closer to a 15-month high of $0.1959.\n \n \nOne of the reasons for today’s climb was the RSI racing past its own ceiling at the 70.00 mark.\n \nPrice strength is now overbought, which could prompt bears to reenter the market in anticipation of a sell-off.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat was behind today’s rebound in stellar?
