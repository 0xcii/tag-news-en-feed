Cryptocurrencies were mostly higher in today’s session, as prices rebounded from recent losses. Ethereum also surged earlier in the day, climbing closer to the $1,300 level.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) climbed higher in today’s session, with the coin surging back above the $17,000 level.\n \nFollowing a low of $16,788.78 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $17,274.60 earlier in the day.\n \nThe move saw bitcoin rally beyond its resistance level at $17,200, hitting a five-day high in the process.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, BTC has since retreated from earlier highs, as bullish momentum faded soon after the breakout.\n \nAs of writing, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 50.93, which is marginally below a ceiling at 52.00.\n \nShould the index continue to move higher, then the next target for bulls will likely be the $17,600 point.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also edged higher in today’s session, with prices rebounding from recent losses.\n \nETH/USD moved to a peak of $1,286.23 on Friday, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,227.50 during Thursday’s session.\n \nAs a result of today’s move, the coin neared a key resistance level of $1,305, rising to its highest point since Monday in the process.\n \n \nCurrently, it appears as though ethereum bulls are targeting a move beyond the $1,300 mark, however a ceiling on the RSI seems to be in the way.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 52.00, which has also been a key point of resistance in the past.\n \nBulls would need to overcome this hurdle first, in order to send prices towards the targeted $1,300 level.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat has been behind today’s rebound in cryptocurrency prices?

A version of this article was originally published on Substack.\nI was raised in a doomsday cult that taught that God was getting ready to wage the war of Armageddon and bring about the end of the current world order. The governments, all ruled by the devil, would be replaced with the Kingdom of Heaven ruled by Jesus Christ. The cult discouraged any kind of real financial planning because of this worldview.
