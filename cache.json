Their study, which cites insights from Bitcoin analyst Alex Bergeron, points out that a single entity now controls the Coinbase outputs for approximately 47% of the network hashrate—a significant concentration that suggests a shift toward oligopolistic tendencies within the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.\n \nBergeron, who has previously addressed issues of centralization, highlights that this trend may be driven by mining pools altering their payout schemes to reduce variance. This adjustment makes such pools more attractive and competitively dominant. Bergeron’s observations are supported by data from @mononautical on Twitter, showing that prominent mining pools like AntPool, F2Pool, and Bina…",
