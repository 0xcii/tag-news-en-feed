With a 60% surge in new client onboarding, a 20% increase in Asset Under Custody (AUC), a 200% upswing in fiat custody, and a 40-fold growth in staked assets. Notably, BitGo has distinguished itself as the entrusted custodian for the FTX creditors' funds under the leadership of John Ray III. Previously, the company was also selected as the distributor for the Mt. Gox creditors.\nBitGo's recent funding success comes on the heels of the launch of its Go Network, empowering institutions to trade and settle both digital assets and fiat currencies round the clock from secure custody. With a robust presence as a premier regulated custodian in more than 50 countries, BitGo consistently handles an 20% of all on-chain Bitcoin transactions by value, according to the announcement.\nBig name clients, such as Nike, have also chosen BitGo's secure and scalable wallet-as-a-service solution to navigate the intricate regulatory landscape.",

          "description": "The digital asset trust firm Bitgo, headquartered in Palo Alto, California, has secured $100 million in a Series C funding round. While the company remains tight-lipped about the participants in this financial endeavor, this fresh infusion of capital catapults the firm’s post-valuation to $1.75 billion.\n \nBitgo Raises $100 Million From Undisclosed Investors\n \nBitgo has successfully bagged $100 million in a Series C funding round, with the investors’ names under wraps, as per a Bloomberg report. Bitgo’s top executive, Mike Belshe, acknowledged the challenging market landscape. Yet, he emphasized the company’s commitment to licensing and regulatory measures, noting, “Regulatory safety is top-of-mind for everyone,” in a conversation with Bloomberg’s Hannah Miller.\n \nThis update comes on the heels of Galaxy Digital scrapping its intentions to snap up Bitgo for a cool $1.2 billion in August 2022. Earlier, in June, Bitgo had its eyes on the beleaguered crypto custodian, Prime Trust, with acquisition plans. However, the deal fell through. Prime Trust soon found itself filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the following month.\n \n \nThough the Prime Trust deal went south, Belshe indicated to Miller that a portion of this fresh capital would fuel future acquisitions. He alluded to two potential buyouts already in the pipeline, as cited by Miller. While Bitgo remains mum on this round’s backers, past investors have featured big names like Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, Redpoint, Goldman Sachs, and DRW Holdings.\n \nWhat do you think about Bitgo’s latest capital raise for $100 million?

And how fitting that it’s a cover of the first Bitcoin ape!”\nBitcoin Magazine ‘Historic Covers’ are now for sale on popular secondary Ordinals markets, including Gamma and MagicEden.",

Bearish sentiment remained high as the session progressed, with the global market cap falling by nearly 2% today. XRP also plunged in today’s session.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) fell for a fourth straight session, as bears continue to regain momentum, following last week’s gains.\n \nAfter peaking at $0.07407 on Tuesday, DOGE/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.06893 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of this fall in price, dogecoin slipped to its lowest level since July 19, when price was at a bottom of $0.0682.\n \n \nThe decline comes following a downward crossover of the moving averages, which is also known as a death cross.\n \nThis week’s bearish momentum intensified after DOGE moved below a support point at $0.0730.\n \nAdditionally, the relative strength index (RSI) also edged lower, dropping to a reading of 39.10, its lowest in four weeks.\n \n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, also remained in the red on Wednesday, dropping to a multi-week low in the process.\n \nXRP/USD bottomed out at $0.5918 earlier in today’s session, which comes following Tuesday’s high at $0.6275.\n \nSimilar to dogecoin above, today’s drop in price saw XRP move to its lowest point since mid-July.\n \n \nOne of the catalysts for the sell-off was a breakout of a support point at the 40.00 mark on the RSI indicator.\n \nThe index is now tracking at 36.76, which is its weakest point since May, a point when the price was hovering around $0.4600.\n \nBulls will hope to reject further drops in price, however will first need to drop below an upcoming floor at the 32.00 zone.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat is behind today’s decline in price?
