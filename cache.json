Straten shared a chart showing how the Bitcoin supply held by the different long-term holder segments has changed over the asset’s history.\n \nThe “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to those investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago. The holders who own coins with an age less than this threshold are known as the “short-term holders” (STHs).\n \n \nStatistically, the longer a holder keeps their coins dormant, the less likely they become to move them at any point.
