          "description": "Aside from last week’s move above $30,000, bitcoin has mostly consolidated below this level for the majority of August. Market volatility has eased, seemingly as a result of lower trading volumes due to the summer period. Despite this, history shows that bulls tend to return closer to the beginning of September. \n \nCurrent Market Status\n \nBitcoin rose above the $30,000 level last Tuesday, after Moody’s downgraded the credit rating of up to ten U.S. small and medium-sized banks.\n \nBitcoiners typically see any negative macroeconomic news to the traditional financial market, as a positive sign for future crypto adoption.\n \nHowever, following this brief rally, BTC has since declined, and has mostly traded around the $29,000 level.\n \nDespite this, could there be stronger gains in the coming weeks?\n \nAugust Outlook\n \nAt the time of writing this, bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,607.50, as traders once again attempted to climb towards the $30,000 level.\n \nThese hopes came as an upward crossover of moving averages was on the cusp of occurring for the first time since June 21.\n \n \nShould the 10-day (red) moving average crossover its 25-day counterpart, momentum will likely turn bullish.\n \nLooking at the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) pushed past a ceiling at 53.00, and looks to be heading towards a higher resistance of 58.00.\n \nIn the event of this taking place, there is a good chance that BTC will be trading above $30,200.\n \nWhere will bitcoin end the month?
