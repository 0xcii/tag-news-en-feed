          "description": "Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), the world's largest pension fund managing over $1.5 trillion in assets, has announced it will explore diversifying a portion of its portfolio into Bitcoin.\nAccording to the announcement, the GPIF will solicit information on illiquid alternative assets like Bitcoin, gold, forests, and farmland as part of its diversification efforts. While not currently invested in these assets, the move signals that the mega-fund is actively researching options beyond stocks and bonds.\nThe GPIF stated it seeks \"basic knowledge about the assets targeted for information provision\" and wants to understand \"how overseas pension funds incorporate them into their portfolios.\"\nAs a large steward of Japanese pensions, the GPIF has been actively honing the sophistication of its investment strategies. In recent years, it has allocated to a more diverse set of assets, including real estate, infrastructure, and private equity.\nBitcoin represents the most high-profile asset being researched. While risky and volatile, BTC is increasingly viewed as an inflation hedge like gold. The GPIF emphasized its announcement does not guarantee future investment, however, the implications of Japanese pension funds buying Bitcoin would be industry-shaking.\nThe exploration comes as Japan passed new laws enabling investment funds to hold Bitcoin directly. It indicates a broader move towards legitimizing Bitcoin within the world's third-largest economy.\nThe GPIF manages pensions for over 67 million Japanese citizens. Currently, 97% of its holdings are domestic and foreign bonds and stocks. Diversification beyond traditional assets would be a major shift for such an influential institutional investor.\nWith over $1.5 trillion at its disposal, even a tiny allocation to Bitcoin by GPIF could significantly impact prices and further legitimize Bitcoin.",

          "description": "Global banking giant Standard Chartered has upped its bitcoin price prediction for the end of 2024 to $150,000, a significant increase from its previous forecast of $100,000.\nIn a new report, Standard Chartered analysts cited strong inflows into recently launched spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. as a primary driver of their bullish outlook. The bank believes these \"sticky\" institutional flows will continue propelling Bitcoin's price.\nStandard Chartered has emerged as one of the more Bitcoin-friendly legacy banks, with an active research team covering Bitcoin. Previously, the bank's analysts had predicted Bitcoin would reach $100,000 by the end of 2024.\nBut with Bitcoin's strong performance in early 2024, the team is now forecasting that it will hit $150,000 within the next nine months. \nStandard Chartered Bank analysts led by Geoffrey Kendrick wrote: \"For 2024, given the sharper-than-expected price gains year-to-date, we now see potential for the price to reach the $150,000 level by year-end, up from our previous estimate of $100,000.\"\nThey expect the rally to continue into 2025, with Bitcoin potentially trading as high as $250,000 next year before settling around $200,000.\nThe updated price prediction comes as spot bitcoin ETFs got approved in the US earlier this year. Standard Chartered believes these regulated investment vehicles are bringing significant institutional demand.\nCombined with Bitcoin's fixed supply and other positive fundamentals, the bank sees room for substantial additional upside. Based on increasing mainstream adoption, Standard Chartered expects new highs.\nTheir bold call illustrates a growing willingness among major financial institutions to make ambitious bitcoin price forecasts. If achieved, a climb to $150,000 would mark a 120% gain from current levels near $68,000. For Standard Chartered, bitcoin's status as \"digital gold\" continues to strengthen.",
