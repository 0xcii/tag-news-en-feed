The Fed increased rates by 25 basis points, and have hinted that they could make an additional move in September. Ethereum neared the $1,900 level today.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) remained in the green on Thursday, as markets reacted to the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision.\n \nAfter deciding on a 0.25% hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that “It is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted.”\n \nBTC/USD surged to an intraday high of $29,675.55 on Wednesday, following an earlier low of $29,162.46.\n \n \nThe move began after the relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a floor at 42.00. It is now hovering around a ceiling at 47.00.\n \nThe exact reading is at 46.65, which has prompted some earlier bulls to abandon previous positions, and secure profits instead.\n \nTraders are likely waiting for the upcoming gross domestic product (GDP) data out later today, before making the next move.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) also edged higher on Thursday, as bulls pushed the cryptocurrency towards the $1,900 level.\n \nFollowing a low of $1,849.98 on Wednesday, ETH/USD moved to peak at $1,886.97 earlier in today’s session\n \nThis is the highest point ethereum has traded at since Monday, when price traded marginally above $1,890.\n \n \nToday’s rally came as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency broke out of a ceiling on the RSI at 48.00.\n \nDespite this, the recent crossover of 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages, means sentiment is predominantly bearish.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 48.95, with price at $1,876.43.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill ethereum hit $1,900 today?

These block rewards are the only way to introduce new coins to the supply, so the rate at which miners hash these blocks can serve as the production rate of the cryptocurrency.\n \nNaturally, if miners would keep on improving their ability to mine these blocks, they would earn rewards faster, and thus, mint coins at a faster rate. Given the basic economics of demand and supply, though, the market being flooded with new tokens would mean that the asset’s value would go down.\n \nIn reality, Bitcoin doesn’t fall …",
