This strategic decision marks a pivotal juncture in El Salvador's Bitcoin journey since the introduction of the Bitcoin Law, which has drawn both admiration and skepticism worldwide.\nAmidst a cacophony of critiques ranging from allegations of human rights violations to inadequate modern infrastructure, El Salvador has stood committed, weathering storms of disapproval from traditional finance stalwarts and even fervent Bitcoin maximalists on Twitter (X) Spaces.
