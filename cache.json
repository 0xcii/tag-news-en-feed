Using a set of charts, TechDev offers a new perspective on Bitcoin’s price dynamics.\n \nIs Bitcoin Halving Overrated?\n \nIn a recent post on X, TechDev asserts, “Still waiting on the halving? The ~3.5 year liquidity cycle has been running before Bitcoin existed.” The chart provided by TechDev illustrates a juxtaposition of Bitcoin’s price movements with a liquidity signal derived from major central bank balance sheets.\n \n \nThe striking feature in this chart is the series of sinusoidal lines that seem to predict pivot points in Bitcoin’s price …",

The DeFi community nowadays is split between “yes” and “no” as an answer to this question after the resurgence of a six-year-old proposal. Since the controversy around sidechains involves advanced crypto language, let’s cover the basics first and then take a deeper look into the pros and cons of the proposal as well as any potential solutions. \nBefore we delve into the specifics of BIP-300, it's worth mentioning that there are alternative approaches to expanding Bitcoin's utility that don't involve sidechains. One such approach is merged mining, which allows Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) to be shared with more chains at no extra cost.

In a move to strengthen its supervision of banks involved in stablecoin activity, the Federal Reserve announced new guardrails in August. \n \nThis heightened attention on stablecoins is driven by concerns that private entities are essentially creating private money, which could pose risks to the stability of the financial system. \n \nMichael Barr, vice chair of the Federal Reserve for Supervision, has called for a robust federal framework to regulate stablecoins. He emphasized the importance of well-regulating private money, especially those stablecoins that are linked to fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, as they inherently rely on the trust of the central bank.\n \n \nBarr’s Assertion: …",

          "description": "BTC Inc., through its Ordinals-focused division Rare BTC, has brokered the sale of inscription number 76 for 1.7 BTC, which is equivalent to approximately $61,000 at the time of sale.\nThe sale is indicative of the active interest and perceived value in the Ordinals space, with Rare BTC positioning itself as a key player in the market for these distinctive bitcoin-based digital artifacts and unique satoshis.\nThe bitcoin ecosystem saw Ordinals generate a craze earlier this year, between May and June, with trading volume nearing that seen on Ethereum NFTs and leading to a spike in bitcoin fees. After a somewhat dull summer, Ordinals activity is back and already nearing the highs seen in May. Notably, yesterday public Ordinals trading volume in the preceding 24 hours surpassed Ethereum NFT’s for the first time.\n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \nRare BTC specializes in the sale of rare satoshis and Sub-100 Ordinals, considered to be highly sought after in the digital collectibles space. This recent transaction follows a previous successful brokerage by Rare BTC, where inscription number 20 was sold for 3 BTC.\nThe company’s role in the Ordinals market includes connecting collectors, artists, and independent brokers to facilitate transactions. BTC Inc.'s established network within the Bitcoin community and its reputation for reliability play a crucial part in completing these sales, particularly as it offers escrow services to ensure secure exchanges between buyers and sellers.\nThose interested in acquiring or selling prime Ordinal inscriptions, or seeking brokerage partnerships, can reach out to Rare BTC through their email at rare@b.tc or DM on Twitter (X). Further information about their services and offerings can be accessed on their website.\nBitcoin Magazine was a pioneer in the Ordinals space, having inscribed its own historic print magazine covers into the bitcoin blockchain among the first 100,000 inscriptions. The oldest cover, Historic Cover #1, sold for 1.25 BTC at auction.",

He wrote: \n\"In nature, positive feedback loops like exist with Bitcoin are lethal; the only thing that’s even kept Bitcoin alive this long is its novelty. Either it will remain a novelty forever or it will transition from novelty status to dead faster than you can blink.\"\nSince then, Bitcoin, the world's most famous cryptocurrency, has defied critics and naysayers like Lynch, surging an astonishing 15 million percent in value since. Indeed, Bitcoin has consistently defied the odds, transforming from a niche experiment into a global financial phenomenon.\nStill, the post, unearthed today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo is notable for proving just how wrong Bitcoin critics can be, with Lynch specifically arguing that economies need intervention and that Bitcoin would fail because it lacked it.\n\"The reason this can’t happen with government currencies is that government currencies *are* backed,\" he wrote. \"They’re backed by bullets. If demand for USD starts to fall faster than the USG would like, the USG can just raise taxes without increasing spending, increasing demand and reducing supply simultaneously. There’s a bunch of stuff the FED can do, of course, and the FED tends to act first, but its operations are harder to explain. This is obviously not a perfect mechanism, since bubbles are still blown and popped, but even this mechanism is not available with Bitcoin.\"\nToday, more and more people are seeing just how destructive that intervention can be, with central banks struggling to contain inflation around the globe.",
