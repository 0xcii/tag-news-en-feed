          "description": "The XRP price action continues to be a concern for many in the XRP community. Some have gone as far as stating that the crypto token’s price is suppressed. This pro-XRP legal expert, however, thinks otherwise as he provides a different perspective on XRP’s relatively tepid movement. \n \nXRP Holders Need Deeper Conviction\n \nIn a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bill Morgan said that convictions (likely in reference to XRP holders) need to be “deeper than a day, week, or month of price action.” He mentioned how he doesn’t read much into a month’s price action in the crypto market. \n \n \nBefore then, the legal expert had highlighted how XRP’s price action hasn’t been great, as it is down over 2% over the last month. Although the 2% drop seems to be significant to Morgan, he was choosi…",

          "description": "In a recent development in the high-profile case of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, a request for postponement of the sentencing hearing was firmly denied by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan. Bankman-Fried’s legal team had sought a four to six-week adjournment, citing the need for additional preparation time. However, the court’s refusal to grant this extension marks a significant moment in this ongoing legal saga.\n \nSam Bankman-Fried Sentencing Date Proceeds as Kaplan Denies Delay\n \nThe defense, representing Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), submitted a formal request for the adjournment of the sentencing hearing, originally scheduled for March 28, 2024.
