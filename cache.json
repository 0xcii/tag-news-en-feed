          "description": "Cardano has been struggling in the market over the last few weeks, completely erasing its gains from March. This continuous decline has put the digital asset in a perilous position as it has dropped drastically on the list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n \nCardano Bows Out To Toncoin And Dogecoin\n \nThe first negative headwinds for Cardano began to blow when Toncoin, a cryptocurrency enjoy serious backing from Telegram, began to rise. As the Toncoin price rose, so did its market cap and in not time it was on its way to knocking a number of assets from their positions.\n \n \nAfter beating Dogecoin, the Toncoin price continued to rise, reaching over $7.
