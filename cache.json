The chosen consortium, Fahrenheit, includes Arrington Capital, a blockchain-based venture capital firm. In addition to the consortium acquiring the company, a new board of directors, primarily appointed by creditors, will oversee the new company formed as a result of the purchase.\nCelsius also revealed that it has secured a backup bid from the Blockchain Recovery Investment Consortium (BRIC), a holding company affiliated with Gemini Trust, owned by the Winklevoss twins, ensuring an alternative option in case the deal with Fahrenheit falls through.\nAccording to Celsius, Fahrenheit will provide the necessary capital, management expertise, and technology to navigate the bankruptcy.

The bearish market conditions, rising energy costs, and increased difficulty levels have made it increasingly difficult for miners to remain profitable. \n \nHowever, according to a recent Twitter thread by Mitchell, a researcher at Blockware Solutions, the tides are shifting, and the outlook for Bitcoin mining is looking positive.\n \nIs The Future Of Bitcoin Mining Bright?\n \nMitchell suggests that to be bullish on mining, one must also be bullish on Bitcoin. BTC has proven to be a resilient asset, with a fixed supply and a growing list of use cases. Mitchell highlights the potential collapse of fiat banking and debt-ceiling increases as factors that make Bitcoin an attractive investment.\n \nRelated Reading: $32 Million Cryp…",

          "description": "Bottlepay, a popular consumer app for Bitcoin transactions, has announced its closure on Monday, July 24, 2023, leaving users with the task of withdrawing their funds. The company stated that all accounts will be closed, and users are urged to withdraw their funds either as Bitcoin or fiat currency (GBP/EUR) from the Bottlepay app before the closure date. \nFailure to withdraw funds by the closure date will result in Bitcoin being converted to fiat currency and returned to the nominated bank account, while any fiat left in the account will be returned to the nominated bank account as well.\nIn a statement, Bottlepay advised users to utilize the app's downloads feature to save transaction statements before the closure date. The company emphasized that Bitcoin transactions can have tax implications, making the downloaded information valuable for future reference. As the closure date approaches, Bottlepay may contact users who still have Bitcoin or fiat currency in their accounts, either through the app or via email. However, the company cautioned users to be aware of potential scams and never initiate an offboarding process outside of the app.\nRegarding the next steps, users are advised to download their transaction history and close their Bottlepay accounts. Instructions on how to withdraw funds from Bitcoin and fiat accounts, as well as how to download transaction history and close accounts, can be found on the app.\nIn a closing note, Bottlepay expressed gratitude to its customers and apologized for the inconvenience caused by the closure. While the company refrained from making specific recommendations about what to do with Bitcoin funds, users were encouraged to exercise due diligence when selecting alternative custodial wallets or converting Bitcoin to fiat currency.
