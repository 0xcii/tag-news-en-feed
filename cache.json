Overall, crypto prices were marginally higher as of writing, with the global market cap currently up 0.49%. Xrp, formerly known as ripple, also rose, with prices nearing a key resistance level.\n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) was in the green on Friday, as prices surged for a second straight session.\n \nADA/USD raced to a high of $0.2623 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after the token was trading at $0.2482.\n \nThe move saw the token climb towards a resistance level of $0.2685, and it is currently trading at its highest point since Monday.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, Friday’s gains come as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has moved closer to a ceiling of its own at 32.00.\n \nThe index is currently tracking at 30.18, with the price slipping from earlier highs, and trading at $0.2586 as of writing.\n \nIn order for bulls to hit the ceiling at the $0.2685 mark, this upcoming ceiling of 32.00 on the RSI must first be broken.\n \n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, also rose on Friday, as the token extended a recent bull run, in hopes of breaking out of a key resistance point.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.3424, XRP/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.3531 earlier in today’s session.\n \nToday’s high is the strongest point that the token has traded at since Sunday, when it was at a top of $0.3555.\n \n \nDespite this recent climb in price, sentiment in XRP still appears to be bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) extending its downwards cross with the 25-day (blue) MA.\n \nIn addition to this, the 14-day RSI is currently tracking at 39.65, which is close to a ceiling of 41.00.\n \nIf bulls are unable to force a breakout of this level, we will likely see XRP once again move lower.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect xrp to break its current resistance of $0.3565 this weekend?
