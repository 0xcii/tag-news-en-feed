The “exchange whale ratio” here is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 Bitcoin transfers to exchanges and the total exchange inflows.\n \nHere, the 10 largest transactions going toward exchanges are assumed to be coming from the whales, which means that the indicator’s value tells us what part of the total exchange inflows is being contributed by these humongous holders right now.\n \nWhen the whale ratio has a high value, it means a large percentage of the exchange deposits ar…",

Now, it is being co-opted by the very same, and zealous newcomers to crypto think that’s a good thing, while still giving lip service to peer-to-peer values. Ignoring the problems with fiat money, they beg political interests and bad actors to regulate Satoshi’s digital innovation. One such actor, Joe Biden, has been in the news recently complaining about not getting enough tax money from struggling Americans. To Biden and his elitist ilk, the destruction of crypto’s possibilities for economic sovereignty is a goal. Taxation is a key means to make that happen. To the crypto OGs, taxation is still theft, and permissionless, peer-to-peer exchange is still the answer.\n \nStop the Sugar-Coating: Why Taxation Is …",
