The decline came following Friday’s move above $32.00, which took the price to an eight-month high. XRP has also rebounded today, and looks to be heading for its recent high over $0.9400.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) was one of Wednesday’s notable movers, as the token ended a three-day losing streak.\n \nFollowing a low of $25.12 on Tuesday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $26.57 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move is the first time solana has trended higher since consolidating a recent eight-month high.\n \n \nFrom the chart, today’s rebound seems to have occurred as a result of the relative strength index (RSI) bouncing from a floor at 66.00\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is at 69.40, with an upcoming resistance point of 71.00 a possible destination for bulls.\n \nShould this ceiling be broken, there is a good chance that solana could head back towards $30.00.\n \n \nXRP\n \nSentiment remained largely bullish in XRP, formerly ripple, as traders once again attempted to push prices above $0.8200.\n \nXRP/USD jumped to a peak of $0.8155 earlier in today’s session, before slipping to a current point at $0.7999.\n \nSince climbing to $0.9479 last week, volatility in the token has skyrocketed, with both new buyers, and profit takers, battling for positions.\n \n \nMarket uncertainty has marginally faded, as a result of the RSI breaking out of a ceiling at 73.00. It is now tracking at 75.07.\n \nDespite the next visible point of resistance being at 89.00, price is already overbought, which could lead to a prolonged sell-off.\n \nAs of writing, XRP remains largely unchanged at the $0.8000 mark.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould XRP hit $0.9000 before the end of July?
