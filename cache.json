Speculators believe the new platform will allow users to make crypto payments. XRP, on the other hand, fell to a ten-day low.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin surged by as much as 5% to start the week, as traders reacted to the news Twitter was rebranding to X.\n \nFollowing the announcement, Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino tweeted that “X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.”\n \nDOGE/USD hit an intraday high of $0.07718 earlier in the day, following Sunday’s low at $0.07056.\n \n \nFrom the chart, the move came after a breakout occurred at the $0.0760 level, pushing the meme coin to its highest point since May 6.\n \nThis resulted in the relative strength index (RSI) escaping its own ceiling at 63.00, and it is currently at 65.46.\n \nTraders will likely continue targeting the $0.08000 level.\n \n \nXRP\n \nXRP plunged to a ten-day low on Monday, as market sentiment seems to have shifted bearish in recent days.\n \nAfter surging to a high of $0.7506 on Sunday, XRP/USD has started the week at a low of $0.6901.\n \nThis is the lowest level the token has traded at since June 13, when price was trading below $0.5000.\n \n \nAs a result of the decline, the RSI edged below a floor of 57.00, and is currently at a reading of 56.72.\n \nShould the index extend its drop under this point, bears will likely look to take XRP back towards $0.5600.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould you see XRP rebound in the coming days?
