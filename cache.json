          "description": "Solana moved to a six-week high on Wednesday, as markets reacted to the latest inflation figures from the United States. The consumer price index (CPI) fell to 5% in March, lower than the 5.2% sum many had expected. Ethereum classic also moved higher, nearing a multi-week high.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) extended yesterday’s 15% gain on Wednesday, as the token rose for a fourth straight session.\n \nSOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $24.34 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after the price was at a low of $22.42.\n \nFollowing today’s surge in price, SOL move to its strongest point since February 21, when it traded at a high of $24.71.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, Wednesday’s rally came as solana bulls took the token beyond a key resistance level of $24.00.\n \nOne of the catalysts for this breakout was the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which moved beyond a ceiling of its own at 64.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 66.65, which is marginally below a higher resistance level of 68.00.\n \n \nEthereum Classic (ETC)\n \nEthereum classic (ETC) continued to trade in the green in today’s session, as prices reached a fresh multi-month high.\n \nFollowing a low of $20.75 on Tuesday, ETC/USD has moved to a high of $22.18 as of writing.\n \n \nToday’s move has seen ethereum classic climb to its highest level since March 18, and comes following a breakout beyond a ceiling at $21.50.\n \nSimilar to solana, this has resulted in price strength moving past its own obstacles, and it is now tracking marginally below another hurdle at the 64.00 mark.\n \nShould the index find a way past this point of resistance, there is a good chance that ETC will head towards $23.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect ethereum classic to maintain this rally?

Here’s what impact it may have on the market, according to Glassnode.\n \nHow Will Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Impact The Market?\n \nLast September, Eethereum successfully transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, meaning that stakers replaced miners as validators on the network.

Anyone that has been locking coins into this contract, however, has been unable to withdraw them so far, as only deposits have been allowed.\n \nThis will finally change with the “Shanghai upgrade,” which is an …",
