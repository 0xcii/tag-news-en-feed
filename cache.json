With the President’s signature, this move will permit Bitcoin trading and payments in Brazil, among other developments that will follow.\n \nPreviously, according to the text of the bills, Brazilian residents were not allowed to use crypto, such as Bitcoin, as legal tender in the country, just as El Salvador did.
