The total value of the crypto market fell by 1.4% within the previous 24 hours, landing at $1.17 trillion as of Tuesday morning (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).\n \n \nThe day’s largest losers included PLS and HEX, two tokens tied to Richard Heart’s projects. In addition, COMP, AAVE, SNX, GMX, and APE sustained losses ranging from 4.87% to 11.35% over the last day.\n \n \nBitcoin (BTC) dropped 1.61% against the US dollar, while ethereum (ETH) fell by 1.72%. With its network’s impending halving event in less than 24 hours, litecoin (LTC) managed to ward off losses and maintained a 0.73% increase as of 11 a.m. on Tuesday.\n \nNevertheless, like bitcoin and various other cryptocurrencies, LTC prices slipped throughout the late hours on July 31. According to coinglass.com data, LTC derivatives traders encountered $2.63 million in liquidations, with $1.88 million in long positions.\n \n \nOf all cryptocurrency derivatives markets, $92.95 million was liquidated over the past day; bitcoin (BTC) positions accounted for $22.38 million and ETH for $16.73 million in liquidations. XRP saw $4.66 million in liquidations, while CRV registered $5.87 million over the previous 24 hours.\n \nApproximately $80.20 million of these liquidations originated from long positions and $12.76 million from shorts. In the last 12 hours alone, there were $13.88 million in liquidations, which included $7.79 million in long positions.\n \nWhat do you think about the $92 million in liquidations over the past day?

Overall, the global market cap was mostly in the red, dropping by 1.44% as of writing. Stellar fell to a one-week low, following a four-day losing streak of its own.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana slipped for a third consecutive session on Tuesday, as the token dropped to a one-week low.\n \nSOL/USD hit a bottom of $23.16 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after price peaked at $24.38.\n \nTuesday’s low is the weakest point solana has hit since July 25, when the token traded under the $23.00 level.\n \n \nOne of the catalysts of this decline appears to be the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a support point at 51.00\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 48.84, with the next visible price floor at 45.00.\n \nThere is a strong chance that SOL bears could push the token towards $20.00, should bearish momentum intensify.\n \n \nStellar (XLM)\n \nStellar (XLM) was another notable token to drop on the first day of the new month, edging lower for a fourth straight day.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.1558 to start the week, XLM/USD retreated to a low of $0.1465 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThis is the lowest point that stellar has hit since last Wednesday, and comes as bears made an attempt to collide with a floor at $0.1445.\n \n \nLike with solana, today’s sell-off in XLM was as a result of the RSI breaking out of a floor at the 59.00 zone.\n \nCurrently, price strength is tracking at 57.11, with the 10-day (red) moving average starting to point downward, following an extended uptrend.\n \nA destination of $0.1250 might be a long-term target, especially in the event of a breakout below $0.1445.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat price point do you expect stellar traders to target this month?
