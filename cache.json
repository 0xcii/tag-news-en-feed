The announcement details:\n \n\nThis is the most extensive seizure of bitcoins by law enforcement authorities in the Federal Republic of Germany to date.\n \n“The bitcoins were seized after the accused voluntarily transferred them to official wallets provided by the BKA [Federal Criminal Police Office],” the police detailed. “This means that a final decision has not yet been made about the utilization of the bitcoins,” they added. At the time of writing, the seized BTC is worth $2.13 billion.\n \n \nThis case involves a 40-year-old German male programmer and his business partner in an ongoing investigation into suspected unauthorized commercial exploitation of copyrighted works and subsequent money laundering.\n \nThe German programmer is accused of operating movie2k.io, which was once Germany’s most successful illegal video-sharing site. The authorities shut the site down in 2013. According to the police, the accused took the profits from the site and invested in bitcoin. He was arrested in 2019.
