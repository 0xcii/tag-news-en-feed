The move saw price rise by as much as 7%, despite the global crypto market cap mostly in the red in today’s session. Toncoin remained higher, following recent gains. \n \nAvalanche (AVAX)\n \nAvalanche (AVAX) was a big mover on Friday, as the cryptocurrency rose by as much as 7% during the day.\n \nFollowing a low of $9.85 on Thursday, AVAX/USD rose to a peak of $10.80 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move pushed avalanche to its highest level since August 29, past a key price ceiling of $10.00 in the process.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) also escaped a resistance level of its own at 65.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, price strength now resides at 68.54, which is its highest point since mid-April this year.\n \nThe next target for current buyers will likely be $11.00, however with the price now overbought, a reversal could also be on the cards.\n \n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin (TON) was in the green for a second straight session, moving closer to a key resistance level in the process.\n \nTON/USD jumped nearly 3% higher on Friday, peaking at the $2.15 level at the time of writing.\n \nOverall, this is the strongest point TON has hit since the end of September, when price last collided with a ceiling of $2.25.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that this occurred as the RSI continued to close in on a ceiling at the 57.00 mark.\n \nWith price strength now at a reading of 54.22, the chances are high that a move to 57.00 will result in toncoin trading at $2.25.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect toncoin bulls to push price above $2.25 this weekend?
