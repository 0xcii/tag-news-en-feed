          "description": "Over the past ten years, fervent supporters of digital currency have engaged in intense debates: Is bitcoin (BTC) designed as peer-to-peer electronic cash as illustrated in Satoshi’s groundbreaking white paper, or does it serve as a digital store of value, similar to gold? Additionally, a central question emerges regarding the primary role of money: should its capacity as a medium of exchange take precedence over its value preservation attributes? The following Learning and Insights explainer delves into the Austrian school of economics, shining a spotlight on Carl Menger’s “On the Origins of Money.”\n \nFrom Spontaneous Social Institution to Currency: Menger’s Insight Into Money’s Evolution\n \nRather than debating whether bitcoin (BTC) should function as a medium of exchange (MoE) or a store…",

The executive stressed: “I just think people make a mistake to look at real-time numbers and not look at the future. And the future has quantitative tightening. We’ve been spending money like drunken sailors around the world.”\n \nJamie Dimon’s Economic Warning\n \nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned about where the U.S. economy is headed at the Barclays 21st Annual Global Financial Services Conference in New York on Monday.\n \nThe executive cautioned: “I just think people make a mistake to look at real-time numbers and not look at the future. And the future has quantitative tightening. We’ve been spending money like drunken sailors around the world, this war in Ukraine is still going on.” Dimon emphasized:\n \n\nTo say the consumer is strong today, meaning you are going to have a booming environment for years, is a huge mistake.\n \n“If and when you have a recession, which you’re eventually going to have, you’ll have a normal credit cycle, which I think is quite predictable. In a normal credit cycle, something always does worse than normal,” he described.\n \nThe JPMorgan boss opined: “There’s a lot of fiscal stimulus taking place out there. And the large one from Covid is still running through. The largest QE is still running through. So we’re still living on that, and that’s really strong. And of course, that drives everything, including business results.”\n \n \nDimon further explained that “businesses feel pretty good because they look at their current results” and see that “they’re not so bad.” However, he cautioned:\n \n\nBut those things change. And we don’t know what the full effect of all these things are going to be 12 or 18 months from now.\n \nDo you agree with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon? Let us know in the comments section below.",
