We encourage governments and corporations to all hold bitcoin as a reserve asset.”   \nMARA said it aims to leverage its technological expertise to support Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem.\n“Prior to last year, the company used to hold all of its bitcoin,” said Salman Khan, MARA’s chief financial officer in the press release. “Given Bitcoin’s current tailwinds, including increased institutional support and an improving macro environment, we are once again implementing this strategy and focusing on growing the amount we hold on our balance sheet. Bitcoin’s recent price decline, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet, afforded us an opportunity to add to our holdings. We look forward to continuing to leverage our technological expertise to support Bitcoin and distributed digital asset ecosystems.”  \nJust last month, MARA announced that it was using the heat generated from its Bitcoin mining to heat a town of 11,000 in Finland. \n\nJUST IN: Marathon is now warming a town of over 11,000 in Finland using heat from #Bitcoin mining 🤯 🇫🇮\n pic.twitter.com/BUEzj7zqOi\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 20, 2024",
