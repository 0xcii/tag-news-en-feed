With a good number of traders still choosing to bet against the price of the pioneer cryptocurrency, the odds that a price reversal is on the horizon have become higher.\n \nBitcoin Shorters Take Center Stage\n \nAs shown in a report that was shared by on-chain data tracker Santiment, crypto investors are becoming increasingly short on Bitcoin. The chart that was posted on X (formerly Twitter) shows short positions completely overwhelming the long positions for now.\n \n \nNow, in times where long positions are dominating, it means that long traders are paying shorts, and in this case, prices are more likely to drop.
