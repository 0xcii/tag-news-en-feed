Sales rose by 0.2% last month, which is more than the 0.5% sum many had forecasted. Ethereum has remained resilient, climbing back above $1,900.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) slipped below $30,000 on Wednesday, following the latest retail sales data from the United States.\n \nAfter climbing to a peak of $30,184.18 on Tuesday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $29,556.43 earlier today.\n \nThe decline came in the midst of a five-day win-less run, which occurred soon after last week’s move close to $32,000.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nBulls have since started to fight back, with bitcoin now back above $30,000, helped by the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nThe index found a support point at the 50.00 mark, and has so far resisted a breakout of this level.\n \nOne area of concern for bulls is a recent downward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages, which could result in a future sell-off.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) was marginally lower on hump-day, as price briefly broke out of the $1,900 level.\n \nETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,878.72 earlier in the day, but has gone on to record a high of $1,918.12.\n \nSimilar to bitcoin, ethereum has been trending lower for five straight days, prior to Wednesday’s rebound.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the RSI is heading towards a ceiling of 55.00, following today’s bounce back, which could be enough to take ETH to a key price point of its own.\n \nThe target appears to be the $1,930 mark, which was last hit during the weekend’s trading session.\n \nIn the event this ceiling is broken, there is a good chance that ethereum could make another run towards $2,000.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \n Could ethereum hit $2,000 this week?
