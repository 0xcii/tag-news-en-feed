          "description": "The police in the Australian state of South Australia recently seized cryptocurrency worth $1.5 million from an alleged dark web drug dealer. Police also recovered a “large quantity” of the synthetic opioid nitazene as well as tens of thousands of dollars in cash.\n \n‘Illicit Activity on a Dark Web Marketplace’\n \nPolice in South Australia, a state in the southern central part of Australia, recently seized cryptocurrency worth $1.5 million from an alleged dark web drug dealer. According to an ABC News report, law enforcement also confiscated a “large quantity” of drugs and electronic devices from an unnamed 25-year-old man.\n \nExplaining how the operation against the alleged drug peddler was carried out, Adam Rice, the South Australian Detective Superintendent, said:\n \n“The investigation identified illicit activity on a dark web marketplace, attributed that activity to a real-life person in South Australia, identified and traced cryptocurrency used in the offending and then ultimately led to a successful search and seizure operation.”\n \n \nAmong some of the drugs seized during the raid on a residential house and two storage units was a synthetic opioid known as nitazene. Authorities in the state are concerned the drug, which is highly toxic and has never been approved for human consumption, could be linked to two overdose cases in which one person died.\n \nMeanwhile, the report also revealed that law enforcement officers also recovered tens of thousands in cash when they raided premises in Adelaide Hills.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",

It can enable pretty much any arbitrary computation, and use that computation to enforce what happens to bitcoin on-chain. \nIt requires no consensus changes to Bitcoin at all. The trick is lifting all of that logic off-chain and being able to challenge a few steps of the computation on-chain if the other party asserts a dishonest outcome.

This comes hot on the heels of Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, transferring a cool $3.79 million in ether within a mere ten days.\n \nEthereum Foundation Parts With Ethereum in $2.76 Million Stablecoin Deal\n \nThrough the decentralized platform, Uniswap, the Ethereum Foundation executed the 1,700 ETH for $2.76 million USDC swap. Eagle-eyed observers and the sharp team at Scopescan didn’t miss a beat. “The Ethereum Foundation has just sold 1.7K ETH ($2.76M) for USDC,” announced Scopescan at a bright and early 4:25 a.m. Eastern Time on Monday. Naturally, this stirred some buzz in the crypto sphere.\n \n“Ethereum Foundation sold 1,700 ETH for $2.7 million because: They are paying to their workers. They are building new projects. They’re supporting new devs and projects. Don’t panic,” advised a fervent ether enthusiast.\n \nThis transaction trails Buterin’s recent move of shipping $3.79 million in ether to centralized platforms within a span of ten days. Data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that the Ethereum Foundation’s coffers still boast a staggering 316,761 ether, valued at a whopping $501 million. Additionally, they’re sitting on a nest egg of around $49 million in wrapped ether (WETH).\n \n \nHistorically, the Ethereum Foundation has been transparent with its finances, releasing periodic reports. It’s anticipated that this latest trade might feature in their upcoming disclosure. Today, ETH’s value dipped by over 3%, seemingly influenced by tensions arising from the Israel-Hamas strife. The crypto giant, second only in market cap, has seen its value slide below the $1,600 mark, currently trading at $1,578 per token.\n \nWhat do you think about the Ethereum Foundation parting ways with 1,700 ether?
