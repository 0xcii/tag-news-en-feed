We therefore grant Grayscale's petition and vacate the order.\"\n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \nIt is important to note that this does not mean GBTC is automatically being converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, although this victory does bring us one step closer to that reality. The order is being vacated and sent back to the SEC. The SEC now has 45 days to appeal and file for an en banc hearing, which means the case will be heard by all 17 judges on the court instead of just the three that were involved in today's decision, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. \n\"The Commission neither disputed Grayscale's evidence that the spot and future markets for bitcoin are 99.9% correlated, nor suggested that market inefficiencies or other factors would undermine the correlation...The Commission’s unexplained discounting of the obvious financial and mathematical relationship between the spot and futures markets falls short of the standard for reasoned decision making,\" Circuit Judge RAO. continued.\nThe price of GBTC pumped over 19% on the news and Bitcoin rose above 5%.",

The Conference Board index is expected to fall to a reading of 116 in August, from 117 the month prior. Ethereum was also marginally lower.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin slipped slightly during Tuesday’s session, as markets began to anticipate the upcoming consumer confidence report from the United States.\n \nBTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,914.93 earlier in today’s session, following a peak of $26,406.15 on Monday.\n \nThe decline sees bitcoin remain in consolidation, however some traders are optimistic about this ending as the week progresses.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, one of the reasons for this long stretch of price uncertainty is the relative strength index (RSI) failing to surge past resistance.\n \nIn this case, the aforementioned ceiling is at the 33.00 mark, which has remained intact for nearly two weeks.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 30.72.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) edged marginally lower on Tuesday, as it continued to trade close to a support point of its own.\n \nFollowing a high of $1,665.14 to start the week, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,641.63 earlier in the day.\n \nThe move saw ethereum once again fall below a support point of $1,650, which it has hovered around for the last ten days.\n \n \nAs of writing, the index remains in oversold territory, with a reading of 30.92, and appears to be heading for a floor at 29.00.\n \nShould it reach this point there is a strong chance that ethereum will move under $1,630.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould today’s report trigger the return of bulls?
