Finzer emphasized the impact this move could have on creators and artists, for which he noted, “We are ready to stand up and fight.”  \n \n \nThe SEC has long been scrutinizing the cryptocurrency and digital asset landscape, targeting various companies, including Coinbase, Uniswap, and Kraken, for perceived regulatory violations. \n \nFinzer criticized the SEC’s regulation by enforcement approach, arguing that it stifles innovation and poses risks to “hundreds of thousands” of artists and creators who lack the resources to navigate complex legal battles.\n \nOpenSea Pledges $5 Million To Support Creators\n \nFinzer also referenced a lawsuit filed against the SEC by musician “Songadaymann” and conceptual artist Brian L. Frye, who fear that their creative works might be classified as unregistered securities offerings. \n \nAccording to Finzer, this legal uncertainty could jeopardize the livelihoods of many creators in the NFT space. Finzer further noted:\n \n\nNFTs are fundamentally creative goods: art, collectibles, video game items, domain names, event tickets, and more. We should not regulate digital art in the same way we regulate collateralized debt obligations.\n \n \nIn response to the SEC’s actions, OpenSea has committed $5 million to support legal fees for NFT creators and developers who receive Wells notices, reinforcing their stance that every creator, regardless of scale, should be able to innovate without fear of regulatory repercussions.\n \n \nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

The outflow ended an eight-day streak of positive inflows totalling $756 million.\nOn Tuesday, the Bitcoin ETF offering from Ark Invest saw the biggest outflow, at $102 million. Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust and Bitwise's Bitcoin ETF also posted net outflows of $18 million and $7 million, respectively.\nBlackRock's Bitcoin ETF saw no inflows after a $224 million inflow on Monday, its largest in over a month, while Fidelity's and other Bitcoin ETFs also saw no changes in inflows or outflows.\nThe largest contributor to yesterday's outflows seems to have been investors' profit-taking after Bitcoin surged past $60,000 early this week. Since then, Bitcoin has pulled back around 10% below $60,000 upon this news.\nThe ETF outflows came as leading financial institutions expanded their bitcoin product offerings. On Tuesday, CME Group launched a new Bitcoin futures contract aimed at retail traders.
