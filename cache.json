The global crypto market cap is nearly 10% higher at the time of writing, with the likes of bitcoin trading at a 17-month high. Cardano also surged, recording a 2-month peak.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was one of Tuesday’s biggest movers, as the token rose by as much as 10% today.\n \nAfter trading at a low of $0.5267 on Monday, XRP/USD climbed to a peak of $0.581 earlier in the day.\n \nThis surge resulted in XRP rising to its highest point since August 18, when price was on the cusp of breaking into the $0.60 region.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the move came after the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nShould bulls intend to maintain this recent round of momentum, they will first need to break a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI) of 72.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 71.70.\n \n \nCardano (ADA )\n \nAdditionally, cardano (ADA) rallied to a multi-month high during today’s session, breaking a key resistance level in the process.\n \nADA/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $0.2911 on Tuesday, after starting the week trading at a low of $0.2626.\n \nToday’s surge in price has sent the cryptocurrency to its strongest level since August 13, and comes after six days of consecutive gains.\n \n \nThis has resulted in price strength now residing in overbought territory, with a current reading of 75.70.\n \nLooking back at the chart, this is the highest the index has hit since January, and was the catalyst for bulls to break a price ceiling of $0.280.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nIs the $0.30 level attainable in the coming days?

The chart which already shows Solana’s price surge above $30 suggests an almost 100% leg-up from this high level.\n \n \nBabenski uses the Solana weekly chart in which they see the price breaking out.
