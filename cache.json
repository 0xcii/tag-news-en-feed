TIA announces $100m funding round. TIA deal was OTC token sale ‘done months ago’. Polymarket considers token, trying $50m raise. Maybe we will pay off debt with crypto: Trump. Harris unlikely to give full crypto policy pre-election. 13m Binance users’ data may have been leaked. Caroline Ellison likely won’t serve time in jail.",
