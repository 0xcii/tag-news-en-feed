          "description": "The parallel market exchange rate of the Cuban peso versus the greenback recently dropped to CUP200 per dollar, a level last seen in Oct. 2022, a report has said. Pavel Vidal, a former economist at the Cuban central bank, said the peso’s depreciation has caused the “impoverishment of the economy and families in dollar terms.”\n \nPeso Down by More Than 20% in 2023\n \nAccording to data provided by El Toque, the Cuban peso’s exchange rate on the parallel market recently matched an all-time low of 200 per dollar last seen in Oct. 2022. The peso’s latest plunge means the currency, which is officially pegged at CUP25:USD1, has now depreciated by over 20% in 2023 alone and by more than 50% in under 12 months.\n \nAs per a report, the peso’s latest plunge has further eroded the purchasing power of Cuban salaries which rarely exceed an equivalent of $25 or 5,000 pesos per month. The currency’s accelerated depreciation is coming at a time when the country’s leader, Miguel Diaz-Canel, has joined other world leaders in advocating for an alternative to the U.S. dollar.\n \n\n \nCommenting on the likely impact of the Central American state’s ongoing currency woes on the population, Pavel Vidal, a former economist at the Cuban central bank, said the peso’s depreciation has left many residents worse off.\n \n“The exchange rate shows the impoverishment of the economy and families in dollar terms,” Vidal, a tutor at Colombia’s Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali, said.\n \nAlthough Cuba is reported to have carried out some market reforms, Vidal insisted that such reforms have failed to boost domestic production. The tutor also argued that the market reforms had failed to contain inflation.\n \nHowever, Cuban officials including President Diaz-Canel have consistently blamed the country’s economic woes on sanctions imposed by the U.S. in the 1960s.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",

          "description": "Hong Kong's leading financial institution, HSBC, has made a significant move by allowing its customers to trade Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This development marks a notable shift in the stance of traditional banks towards bitcoin, as HSBC has previously been cautious in embracing it.\nReporting by CoinDesk highlighted that HSBC's decision to enable bitcoin ETF trading for its customers comes after several prior developments that saw other banks also allow such activity. Notably, Samsung Asset Management launched the Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prior to that, the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF launched on the same platform, receiving approximately $53 million in initial investments. \nThe decision by HSBC to allow its customers to trade bitcoin ETFs comes amidst a surge of institutional interest in bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., potentially igniting a race between countries to attract capital with these products. \nThe developments are also indicative of the evolving attitudes towards bitcoin among financial institutions. As traditional banks begin to embrace bitcoin, it signals a potential shift towards wider adoption and integration of bitcoin into the mainstream financial system. The merits of this are debatable, but on the surface, that appears to be what these moves signify.\nETFs are popular investment vehicles, and the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs would open up new opportunities for institutional investors to participate in the bitcoin market within a regulated framework. While this comes at the cost of many of the inherent properties that make bitcoin valuable, institutions prefer the rails of regulation and are more likely to be trusting of firms like BlackRock. There are, of course, exceptions to this such as MicroStrategy, a company that holds its own bitcoin.",
