          "description": "Despite the first pause in a historic series of interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, Bitcoin price appears unaffected, maintaining a steady price range between $25,000 and $28,000. \n \nAmid the market digesting the Fed’s interest rate decision, the leading cryptocurrency has so far exhibited a muted reaction to the central bank’s latest, less-hawkish move. But why?\n \nFederal Reserve Puts Rate Hikes — And Bitcoin — On Pause\n \nMinutes ago, the Federal Reserve, in a remarkable decision, held its key interest rate steady, temporarily halting what had been the sharpest flurry of rate hikes in four decades. While a pause was expected to provide some direction to the market, Bitcoin, currently trading at $25,800, has remained stable within its current price range.\n \n \nIn their fight against rampant inflation, Federal Reserve officials have hinted at the possibility of two more rate hikes later this year. This projection surpasses the expectations of many market analysts and economists.\n \nTypically, such monetary policy adjustments by central banks have the potential to jolt global financial markets. Yet, the cryptocurrency’s muted response to the recent Federal Reserve actions remains noteworthy. Despite numerous potential catalysts for price fluctuations, the leading cryptocurrency is demonstrating a degree of price stability that belies its reputation for volatility.\n \n\n \n \nLooking Ahead At The Fed’s Fight Against Inflation And Impact On Crypto\n \nLooking ahead, the Fed’s continued effort to combat inflation through more rate hikes could introduce further variables into the crypto market landscape. As a potential yet thus unproven hedge against inflation, Bitcoin might yet see movement that bucks the trend.\n \n \nInvestors and observers will be watching closely as the year unfolds. The prevailing question is whether Bitcoin will maintain its current uncharacteristic stability, or whether the anticipated Federal Reserve actions will eventually trigger a more substantial response.",

This decline comes as overall market sentiment remains bearish, following last week’s actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Cardano was also back in the red today.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, dropped by over 9% in today’s session, as traders seemingly moved to secure recent gains.\n \nXRP/USD rose to a ten-week high of $0.5614 on Tuesday, however today’s sell-off has sent the token to a bottom at $0.5009.\n \nThe decline comes as bulls were unable to maintain yesterday’s breakout of a key resistance level at $0.5490.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the shift in sentiment came as the relative strength index (RSI) retreated to a floor of its own at 52.00\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking marginally above this point at 52.11, with a ceiling of 58.00 the possible target for bulls.\n \nIn the event it reaches this level, it is likely that XRP will once again be trading above $0.5500.\n \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) was another notable token to move into the red on Wednesday, with the price remaining close to a key support point.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.2895 on Tuesday, ADA/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.2699 today.\n \nAs a result of the move, cardano remained near its long-term price floor at $0.2700, which was broken over the weekend.\n \n \nSaturday’s drop sent ADA to its weakest point since January, however this decline was short lived, with bulls sweeping in to buy the dip.\n \nDespite rebounding in recent days, the RSI continues to track below 30.00, which is a sign of current bearish pressure.\n \nBulls are likely looking at the $0.3000 level as a short-term target, however there will likely be a high level of volatility preventing this point from being hit.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill there be a price recovery in cardano this week?
