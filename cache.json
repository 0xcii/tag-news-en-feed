          "description": "Taiwanese law enforcement recently revealed the seizure of more than 320 million USDT stablecoins from an alleged money launderer. The seizure has been described as Taiwan’s largest bust ever from a single individual.\n \nLamborghini and a Lexus Seized\n \nTaiwan’s law enforcement recently said it nabbed the four individuals behind what is being described as the region’s “largest virtual currency money laundering syndicate.” In a statement, the region’s law enforcement bodies said one of those arrested who is only identified as Qiu is said to have laundered more than 320 million USDT stablecoins. Three more individuals were also arrested alongside Qiu, the statement added.\n \nAccording to a local language report, the now-seized funds relate to an investment fraud case operated by Qiu which was uncovered back in October 2022. However, despite the unmasking fraud scheme, law enforcement agents did not immediately arrest Qiu who is said to have frequently travelled to Malaysia and other South East Asian countries.\n \n \nHowever, it was upon his return to Taiwan in June 2023 that agents finally detained Qiu and his accomplices and seized their mobile phones. As stated in the report, officials only discovered the extent of Qiu’s money laundering activities after they examined the accused’s mobile phones. As per the report, the value of the virtual currency during the raid on Qiu is believed to be the highest amount ever seized from one individual.\n \nBesides the virtual currency, Taiwanese law enforcement is reported to have recovered two vehicles, a Lamborghini URUS and a Lexus LM luxury from Qiu’s residence. Laptops, credit cards, drugs, and three expensive watches were also seized.\n \nMeanwhile, prosecutors from the Taichung District Prosecutor’s Office are said to have set Qiu’s bail at just over $3,000 and $600 for one of his accomplices.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",

According to the bank, the authors of the message had seemingly “modified text eked from an old policy” by a previous governor in 2007.\n \n \nPress Release: No Plans To Redenominate The Naira pic.twitter.com/mBMvZogLWs\n \n— Central Bank of Nigeria (@cenbank) October 31, 2023\n \n\n \nNigerians Told to Ignore the Message\n \nThe Nigerian Central Bank has refuted claims in a widely circulating text message that it plans to redenominate the faltering local currency in January 2024. In a statement released by its director of communications, the bank said the Nigerian public should ignore the “misleading” message whose objective is to cause chaos.\n \n \nAccording to the bank, the said text message, which has been dismissed before, is now seemingly gaining traction and has sparked several debates on such a policy’s impact on the economy.\n \n“We wish to reiterate that the contents of the message are misleading. The authors of the message, in their mischief, modified a text eked from an old policy by a previous CBN Governor in 2007 to make it appear recent,” the central bank’s statement said.\n \nWhile acknowledging that it is considering reforms, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) however said it has not taken steps to redenominate the naira as stipulated in the CBN Act of 2007. Meanwhile, the bank has since urged Nigerians to ignore the “speculative” message which is “calculated to cause panic in the polity.”\n \nRegister your email here to get a weekly update on African news sent to your inbox:\n \n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
