The more people who can’t afford it the bigger the divide between rich and poor. You can't have a fence because you can't have a li…",

This step marks BlackRock as the first asset  \nmanager to list its iShares ETFs on each of Cboe's listing exchanges worldwide.\nDave Howson, the Executive Vice President and Global  \nPresident at Cboe Global Markets, mentioned: \"This latest listing of  \niShares ETFs on Cboe Australia is a major milestone and a significant step  \nforward to deliver on Cboe's global listings vision.

Cboe is one of the largest ETF listing venues in the  \nUS, hosting over 680 ETF listings. According to the press release, Cboe  \nAustralia accounts for up to 40% of the Australian ETF daily trading volume.\nLast month, The US Securities and Exchange  \nCommission approved the applications of 11 firms for spot Bitcoin ETFs. These  \nETFs were authorized to be listed on US stock exchanges, including NYSE Arca,  \nNasdaq, and Cboe BZX, and are available for trading starting today.\nThe approved issuers are ARK 21Shares, Invesco  \nGalaxy, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, Valkyrie, BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise,  \nHashdex, and Franklin Templeton.\nBitcoin ETFs Poised for Record Inflows\nAnalysts speculate significant inflows into Bitcoin  \nETFs, estimating between $50 billion and $100 billion in the first year.  \nHowever, the SEC’s Chief Gary Gensler clarified the approval’s scope,  \nemphasizing it does not reflect approval for crypto asset securities.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.",
