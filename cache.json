          "description": "Crypto Twitter has been engulfed by a tantalizing controversy that has the entire community buzzing – the explosive, albeit fleeting, rise and precipitous fall of a new memecoin named BALD, launched on Base, and the unexpected name tied to it – Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the founder of FTX.\n \nThe BALD memecoin, humorously named after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, launched on July 30 and took off on an unbelievable 290,000% gain within its first 24 hours. However, it wasn’t long before the euphoria turned sour as the anonymous deployer of BALD withdrew 10,705 ETH ($20 million) and 224.6 million BALD from liquidity, causing the token’s price to plummet by over 90%. Despite allegations of a ‘rug pull’, the deployer denied these accusations.\n \nIs SBF The Puppet Master Of BALD?\n \nThis chain of ev…",
