Close collaboration and wider community engagement with Ordinals is encouraged and supported,\" he said.\nOperating as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Open Ordinals Institute will accept tax-deductible donations, enabling a transparent and sustainable funding model. Previously funded privately and through personal gifts, this shift ensures the protocol's neutrality while supporting developers.\nOrdinals core developer Ordinally echoed this sentiment in a statement, saying that the non-profit organization presents itself as \"the cleanest way\" to compensate developers without compromising the neutrality of the protocol.\nThe Ordinals.org website will facilitate community updates and resource sharing related to the Ordinals protocol development.\nDonations to support the Ordinals core team and the Open Ordinals Institute can be made at Ordinals.org. The organization expects IRS approval for tax-deductible status in 2023, currently accepting Bitcoin donations.\nThe Open Ordinals Institute's establishment assures a promising future for the transformative Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, facilitating its continuous growth and development.",

The total value of the crypto market fell by 1.4% within the previous 24 hours, landing at $1.17 trillion as of Tuesday morning (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).\n \n \nThe day’s largest losers included PLS and HEX, two tokens tied to Richard Heart’s projects.

With its network’s impending halving event in less than 24 hours, litecoin (LTC) managed to ward off losses and maintained a 0.73% increase as of 11 a.m. on Tuesday.\n \nNevertheless, like bitcoin and various other cryptocurrencies, LTC prices slipped throughout the late hours on July 31. According to coinglass.com data, LTC derivatives traders encountered $2.63 million in liquidations, with $1.88 million in long positions.\n \n \nOf all cryptocurrency derivatives markets, $92.95 million was liquidated over the past day; bitcoin (BTC) positions accounted for $22.38 million and ETH for $16.73 million in liquidations. XRP saw $4.66 million in liquidations, while CRV registered $5.87 million over the previous 24 hours.\n \nApproximately $80.20 million of these liquidations originated from long positions and $12.76 million from shorts. In the last 12 hours alone, there were $13.88 million in liquidations, which included $7.79 million in long positions.\n \nWhat do you think about the $92 million in liquidations over the past day?
