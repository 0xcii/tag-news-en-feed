Prices rose by as much as 17% in today’s session, as the global cryptocurrency market cap also trended higher. Polkadot was once again in the green, with the token hovering close to a two-month high of its own. \n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) rallied on Wednesday, as the meme coin surged to a two-month high, following declines on Tuesday.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.00001053, SHIB/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.00001289 earlier in today’s session.\n \nToday’s move saw shiba inu climb to its strongest point since early November, when prices last collided with a ceiling at the $0.00001290 level.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the move came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rebounded from a support point at 76.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at a level of 80.31, which is deep in overbought territory.\n \nEarlier gains have also been wiped out, and the meme coin is currently trading at $0.0000124.\n \n \nPolkadot (DOT)\n \nPolkadot (DOT) continued to trade near a two-month high, as the token remained near a key resistance level.\n \nDOT/USD jumped to a high of $6.19 earlier in the day, before selling off following the release of U.S. retail sales figures.\n \nSales in the world’s largest economy fell by 1.1% in December, more than the decline of 0.8% many had expected.\n \n \nAs a result of the news, earlier gains have now been erased, with the price currently trading at $5.69.\n \nThe RSI has also given way, with price strength falling below a floor of 70.00, and currently tracking at 64.25.\n \nShould this reversal worsen, DOT could be heading to a floor of $5.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill polkadot continue to move lower as the week progresses?

This afternoon’s economic release is expected to show a cooling off of sales, as consumers prepare for a recession. Ethereum also rose on the news, as it continued to hover close to $1,600. \n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) rose above a key resistance level at $21,400 in today’s session, hitting a fresh multi-month high in the process.\n \nFollowing a low of $21,120.16, BTC/USD raced to a peak of $21,438.66 in the early hours of Wednesday’s session.\n \nThis surge in price saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency climb to its strongest point since September 13.\n \n \nThe move comes as markets prepare for the release of U.S. retail sales figures, which are expected to decline to -0.8%, from -0.6%.\n \nFrom the chart, price strength continues to hover in overbought territory, with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) tracking at 87.92.\n \nThe next visible point of resistance is at the 90.00 mark, which could pose a challenge for longer-term bulls.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) also moved marginally higher on Wednesday, as it continued to trade near a ceiling of $1,600.\n \nETH/USD jumped to a high of $1,594.00 on hump day, less than 24-hours after falling to a bottom of $1,562.06.\n \nToday’s gain in price now means that ethereum has climbed higher for ten of the last eleven sessions.\n \n \nAs of writing, the 14-day RSI is tracking at 84.18, which like bitcoin, is deep in overbought territory.\n \nLooking at the chart, the last time ETH traded at this point in early November, it was followed by a significant drop in price.\n \nMany technical traders will likely pay attention to this, and a fear of history repeating itself could lead to many liquidating current positions.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill strong retail sales data help boost crypto prices further?
