During that period, 5.3 million SHIB tokens were burnt in a single transaction, contributing significantly to this surge. \n \n \nSHIB’s burning program was recently one of the major talking points in the SHIB community as Shiba Inu team member Ragnar drew the community’s attention to how this was setting SHIB up for…",

You are responsible for your own funds, you are responsible for keeping them safe, you are responsible for everything. This can be a daunting prospect, but there are ways to approach self-custody simply.\nSecuring your Bitcoin can be thought of similarly to building a house. First, you have to lay a foundation, then you build a frame on top of that, from there you fill in the walls, insulation, utilities, etc. For each piece of the house you want to add, you need to have completed the previous piece properly or the entire house will be unsafe and unstable. \nWhen it comes to Bitcoin security, your seed phrase is the foundation of your security.
