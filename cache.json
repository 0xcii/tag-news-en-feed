          "description": "On-chain data suggests a Bitcoin indicator may finally form a pattern historically associated with bull runs.\n \nBitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Reversed Their Trend Recently\n \nAccording to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the recent activity of the hodlers has been typical for bull markets in the past. IntoTheBlock defines “hodlers” as investors who have held their Bitcoin since at least one year ago.\n \nMore specifically, the addresses that have kept their coins still on the blockchain for at least a year (that is, they haven’t involved the coins in any transactions) qualify as long-term holders (LTHs).\n \n \nNote that the cutoff for the LTHs used by other analytics firms ranges between five to six months, which differs from the one-year threshold used by IntoTheBlock.…",
