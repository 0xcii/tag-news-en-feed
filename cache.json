The move came as the global cryptocurrency market cap surged, as U.S. inflationary pressures continued to cool off. Ethereum classic was also in the green, with price hitting a two-month high.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) was one of Friday’s notable movers, as the meme coin moved to a six-week high.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.000009227 on Thursday, SHIB/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.000009711 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of today’s surge, the meme coin hit its highest point since December 5, when it traded as high as $0.00001016.\n \nLooking at the chart, the move came as shiba inu climbed beyond a ceiling at the $0.00000945 mark.\n \n \nIn addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved past a ceiling of its own at 68.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 71.74, which is deep in overbought territory.\n \n \nEthereum Classic (ETC)\n \nEthereum classic (ETC) was another big gainer in today’s session, with prices moving closer to a two-month high.\n \nETC/USD rose to a high of $21.76 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after hitting a bottom at $20.02.\n \nThis move pushed the token to its strongest level since November 10, when ETC hit a resistance of $23.00.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, bulls appear to be attempting to take ethereum classic back to this point, if recent bullish momentum can be sustained.\n \nThis will likely be made difficult by a resistance level of 67.00 on the RSI, which hasn’t been broken since last August.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect to see ethereum classic hit $23.00 in the coming days?
