Energy surpluses allow for every form of wealth creation, which in turn produce new technologies to effectively harness yet more energy. This truth has inspired famous concepts such as the Kardashev scale, which measures civilizations by their ability to harness energy resources towards useful ends. \nCompute is a natural continuation of this endeavor. Modern digital technology transforms ever greater quantities of electricity into advanced value-creating processes.
