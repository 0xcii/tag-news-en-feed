          "description": "Bitcoin cash was once again in the red on July 5, as traders continued to secure gains following a recent 15-month high. The token fell for a third straight session, whilst the overall global crypto market cap also slipped on Wednesday. Monero was another notable token to fall in today’s session.\n \nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n \nBitcoin cash (BCH) slid by as much as 9% on Wednesday, as traders continued to capture profits following a recent bull run.\n \nThe cryptocurrency surged to a 15-month high last Friday, after climbing to a peak at $329.71.\n \nHowever, the price dropped to an intraday low at $258.17 in today’s session, a day after trading at $281.46.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, BCH has now dropped for a third straight session, a sell-off which started after the relative strength index (RSI) fell below a ceiling at 81.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 65.73, which is marginally below a floor around the 66.00 level.\n \nOverall, the decline seems to be a result of profit taking which came once the RSI moved deep into overbought territory.\n \n \nMonero (XMR)\n \nMonero (XMR) was also in the red in today’s session, dropping lower for a second consecutive session.\n \nFollowing a peak at $169.52 on Tuesday, XMR/USD moved to a bottom at $161.89 earlier in the day.\n \nThe decline comes as the token failed to break out of a ceiling at $173.00 on Monday, after hitting its highest point since February 4.\n \n \nOne of the reasons for this was also due to the RSI, which was unable to move past a resistance level of 73.00.\n \nCurrently, price strength is now tracking at 63.86, and appears to be headed to a floor at the 58.00 mark.\n \nShould the index move to this floor, there is a possibility that XMR will drop to $160.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat is the lowest point monero could hit this week?
