          "description": "A recent revelation by a SlowMist security researcher has highlighted a new type of attack aimed at cryptocurrency holders using Apple devices. The researcher disclosed that a malicious phishing program has been detected on the Apple App Store which he described as the newest form of attack targeting Apple IDs.\n \nCryptocurrency users have been warned to be particularly cautious as many of them rely on iCloud to back up their wallets. This is because, in the event of an attack, their assets could be at risk of loss if their 2FA gets compromised.\n \nThe malicious phishing program is able to do this by replicating normal applications. And subsequently, the attacker adds their own number to the trusted two-factor authentication list, thereby gaining control over the account permissions.\n \nRelat…",

Even within the U.K., tales of students leaving with £90,000 (about $115,000) of debt are not uncommon, which raises the question of the value that can be realized by a university degree when offset by this considerable cost. \nTo help manage the scale of this expenditure, it is now common for students to have part-, if not full-time, jobs, with recent figures showing this is the case for the majority of students in the U.K. The same article also stated that the time some students spend on university work suffers as a result of the time they dedicate to paid employment. \nAs a university educator, this situation causes me great personal discomfort, with students t…",
