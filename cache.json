Although no new tokens were added to two of the funds, Grayscale revealed that it added Lido DAO’s native cryptocurrency and governance token, LDO, to the Defi Fund.\n \nLDO Added to Grayscale’s Defi Fund\n \nGrayscale Investments, the digital asset manager, announced its second-quarter 2023 update, which covers fund rebalancing and a new token addition to the Defi Fund. The Digital Large Cap Fund and Smart Contract Fund experienced no changes in terms of added or removed tokens.\n \nNonetheless, Grayscale disclosed in the update that it included Lido’s LDO token in the assortment of decentralized finance (defi) tokens held within the Defi Fund. The digital asset manager utilized cash proceeds to acquire the lido (LDO) token for the fund.\n \nLDO holds the second-largest weight in the fund’s portfolio of coins, with uniswap (UNI) being the largest, representing 45.46% of the fund’s holdings, while LDO now accounts for 19.04%. Following UNI and LDO in terms of weight are AAVE (11.53%), MKR (10.82%), CRV (7.03%), and SNX (6.12%).\n \n \nLDO ranks as the 33rd largest market capitalization out of nearly 10,000 crypto assets within the crypto economy. On Saturday, July 8, 2023, LDO increased by 2% against the U.S. dollar, but it has experienced a loss of more than 10% over the past 30 days.\n \nLooking at six-month statistics, LDO is down 1%, and it remains 73% lower than the all-time high recorded on August 20, 2021. Currently, with the inclusion of LDO in the fund’s portfolio, Grayscale’s Defi Fund’s assets under management (AUM) stand at $3,144,411 as of July 7.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on Grayscale’s addition of Lido’s LDO token to the Defi Fund and its impact on the fund’s portfolio?

Today’s move came following a breakout of a key price level, despite the global crypto market cap consolidating. Avalanche also rallied, climbing by as much as 10%.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) was a notable gainer in the crypto market for a third straight day, with today’s move taking price to an eight-week high.\n \nFollowing a low of $20.19 on Friday, SOL/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $22.40 to start the weekend.\n \nAs a result of the surge, solana raced past a ceiling of $22.00, hitting its highest point since May 6 in the process.\n \n \nFrom the chart, the move occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped beyond a ceiling at the 69.00 mark.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 70.70, with the next visible point of resistance at 75.00.\n \nShould the index reach this point, there is a good chance that SOL will climb to $23.00.\n \n \nAvalanche (AVAX)\n \nAnother notable gainer on Saturday was avalanche (AVAX), which rose by nearly 10% in today’s session.\n \nAVAX/USD climbed to a high of $13.85 earlier in today’s session, a day after trading at a low of $12.60.\n \nThe move resulted in avalanche jumping to its strongest level since June 9, after breaking out of a resistance level of $13.50.\n \n \nOne of the catalysts of this rally was the 14-day RSI breaking out of its own ceiling at the 57.00 mark.\n \nThe index is now tracking at 58.73, and looks to be making strides for a higher point of resistance at 62.00.\n \nAdditionally, the 10-day (red) moving average has just avoided a downward crossover, with momentum once again shifting upward.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect avalanche to hit $15.00 in the next few days?
