In some ways, yes, the beginnings of institutional involvement were apparent. Most notably, MicroStrategy led the way with its ongoing purchases of BTC as a treasury asset, and Tesla partly joined in this endeavor, although not nearly to the same extent, and with some selling later, while as well as holding BTC, the carmaker very briefly accepted it as a payment option.\n However, as 2022 …",
