He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

But it may happen at some point,” he was quoted by Russian news outlet Tass as saying. The official emphasized:\n \n\nWe all need to work to ensure that this threat of global confrontation, of a hot, full-scale World War III should not materialize.\n \nCommenting on the current conflict between Russia and Western countries, he stressed that Russia has no desire to see a war break out.\n \nHowever, he said: “But world tensions are white-hot indeed.”\n \n \nNoting that he and his friends “used to talk about confrontation with the United States, about confrontation between the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Alliance,” the Russian official stressed:\n \n\nBack then it seemed like some kind of hypothetical, far-fetched and impossible scenario. But I can’t say that now, however sad this may sound.\n \nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said this week that anti-Russia sanctions will have a detrimental impact on the global economy, with the potential to spark a global economic crisis. To reduce its dependence on the USD after the U.S. seized about $300 billion of its foreign reserves, Russia is pushing for the BRICS to gain global influence. The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are also working on creating a currency.\n \nWhat do you think of the Russian official’s statement about World War III?
