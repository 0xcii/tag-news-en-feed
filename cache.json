Here’s what the previous cycles looked like at the same point.\n \nNext Bitcoin Halving Is Only Around 280 Days Away Now\n \nThe “halving” refers to a periodic event where Bitcoin’s block rewards are permanently cut in half. The block rewards are what miners receive as compensation for solving blocks on the network.\n \nThis event takes place every four years, with the next one being scheduled to take place sometime next year. The exact estimates differ between different mining-related platforms, but in the context of the current discussion, the next halving is assumed to be taking place in about 280 days.\n \nHistorically, halvings have held immense importance for the cryptocurrency, as the block rewards are essentially the o…",

Prices rose as traders continued to react to a recent tweet from Elon Musk. Another notable gainer was polkadot, which rose nearly 7% higher.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) was a notable mover during Friday’s session, as the meme coin climbed to a multi-month high. This occurred as price continued its reaction to a recent Elon Musk tweet.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.06855 on Thursday, DOGE/USD surged to an intraday peak of $0.07639 earlier today.\n \nThis resulted in dogecoin hitting its strongest point since May 6, when its price peaked above $0.0800.\n \n \nOne of the catalysts behind today’s move was a breakout of the 62.00 level on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is now at 64.24, with an upcoming resistance point of 66.00 a possible target for buyers.\n \nEarlier momentum has marginally faded, with DOGE now trading at $0.074.\n \n \nPolkadot (DOT)\n \nAdditionally, polkadot (DOT) also rallied to end the week, as the token rose by as much as 7% in today’s session.\n \nDOT/USD jumped to a high of $5.69 on Friday, which was a day after the price fell to a bottom at $5.15.\n \nAs a result of this rally, polkadot peaked at its highest level since last Friday, when it reached a then two-month high of $5.74.\n \n \nThe token edged lower after bulls were unable to extend gains towards a key resistance level of $6.00.\n \nOverall, this appeared to come as price strength failed to surge past its own ceiling at the 60.00 mark.\n \nAt the time of writing, the indicator is now closing in on this point, and in the event it breaks beyond this zone, DOT will likely climb past the $6.00 mark.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect polkadot to hit $6.00 this weekend?
