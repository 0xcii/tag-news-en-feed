          "description": "Polygon (MATIC) has been on the lower performance end when compared to other cryptocurrencies in the space. However, this muted performance could be a precursor to a bullish momentum outside of the general market recovery, something that has become a norm for the MATIC price. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified Polygon’s potential in this aspect, expecting the price to rise as high as $1.82 once a major level is breached.\n \nPolygon Gearing Up For Bullish Breakout\n \nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez points out that the Polygon price is looking toward breaking a significant resistance. Mainly, such a breakout would be the catalyst for the expected price surge which could trigger a 100% price increase.\n \n \nAs the analyst explains, the trigger for this would be a daily or weekly candlestick c…",

          "description": "In November, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), a principal measure of inflation, registered a modest rise of 0.1%, maintaining a consistent annual increase of 3.1%. This minor growth in prices reflects subtle economic shifts, with energy costs witnessing a marked reduction, in contrast to the gradual rise in expenses for housing and food.\n \nU.S. Inflation Rate Holds Steady: Minor CPI Rise Amid Falling Energy Costs\n \nThe data released on Tuesday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics highlighted a significant 2.3% fall in energy prices. This decline, led by a 6% drop in gasoline and a 2.7% fall in fuel oil prices, played a pivotal role in moderating the overall inflation rates. The latest inflation figures had a subdued effect on Wall Street, as major stock indexes exhibited little fluct…",

Inscriptions are definitely not good for bitcoin, but how bitcoiners are trying to stop them will be far worse than any damage inscriptions could have ever caused.\nInscriptions work by embedding images or other data into the bitcoin blockchain by using a trick in bitcoin script. They essentially put the data in an unreachable code block followed by the real spending conditions so the user can claim the ordinal/NFT. It is quite an ingenious trick but has broke a lot of the assumptions many bitcoiners were operating under. Previously, the main way to embed data into bitcoin was OP_RETURN, which is basically an op code exactly meant for embedding data but had two problems for t…",
