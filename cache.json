Overall, cryptocurrency markets rebounded from recent losses, with the global market cap up 5.90% at the time of writing. Avalanche also surged, hitting a one-week high.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) surged to a ten-month high earlier in the day, as prices rose for a third consecutive session.\n \nMATIC/USD moved to a peak of $1.39 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after trading at a low of $1.27.\n \nAs a result of Thursday’s high, MATIC/USD jumped to its strongest point since April last year.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, polygon has had a mini-bull run this week, after bouncing off a floor at $1.20, leading up to a move to a ceiling at $1.35 today.\n \nEarlier gains have marginally eased, however, with the relative strength index (RSI) moving close to a ceiling at 70.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 68.22, with MATIC/USD at the $1.37 mark.\n \n \nAvalanche (AVAX)\n \nAvalanche (AVAX) extended recent gains on Thursday, leading to prices hitting a one-week high.\n \nFollowing a low of $18.39 on hump-day, AVAX/USD raced to an intraday high of $20.31 earlier in the day.\n \nThis resulted in avalanche climbing to its highest point since February 8, when the token last collided with a ceiling at $21.00.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the initial surge took place following a break beyond a resistance at 55.00 on the RSI indicator.\n \nHowever, at the time of writing, price strength appears to be moving back towards this level.\n \nShould bears continue to push momentum lower, there is a strong chance AVAX could fall to a floor below $18.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect avalanche to hit $21.00 this week?
