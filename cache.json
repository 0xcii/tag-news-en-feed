          "description": "World Wide Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee says cryptocurrency is “really dangerous” and “only speculative.” While claiming that crypto is for those who “want to have a kick out of gambling,” he noted that it could be useful for remittances.\n \nSir Tim Berners-Lee on Crypto\n \nSir Tim Berners-Lee, the British computer scientist who is widely credited with the invention of the World Wide Web, shared his thoughts about cryptocurrency on CNBC’s “Beyond the Valley” podcast, published last week.\n \nBerners-Lee called cryptocurrency “dangerous” and likened it to gambling. Claiming that “cryptocurrency can be 100% speculative” and “not linked to anything at all,” he opined:\n \n\nIt’s only speculative. Obviously, that’s really dangerous.\n \nHe asserted that crypto is for “if you want to have a kick out of gambling, basically.” He also compared cryptocurrency to the dot-com bubble, noting that people were valuing various internet stocks “because of what they imagined other people will value them in the future, so in other words it wasn’t based on revenue or anything real so the bubble came.” He further stressed: “Investing in certain things, which is purely speculative, isn’t what, where I want to spend my time.”\n \n \nHowever, Berners-Lee said cryptocurrencies could be useful for remittances. He shared:\n \n\nHaving been using it for remittances, that seems to be the most useful thing, if you transfer stuff into blockchain because you can get that immediately to your family.\n \nThe British computer scientist emphasized: “Just don’t keep the currency … get rid of it, put it back into USD.”\n \nWhat do you think about Tim Berners-Lee’s view on crypto? Let us know in the comments section below.",
