He explained:\n \n\nThe new Orb is coming and the next iterations will look quite different.\n \nFurthermore, Blania clarified that this new version of the Orb will be more friendly and appealing, similar to an Apple product. He also acknowledged that the current design was polarizing, with some people loving it and some hating it due to its sci-fi-like appearance.\n \nWhile there was no announcement of the precise date of the reveal of this upgraded Orb, Blania stated that it would be launched in the first half of 2024 and that it had already been field-tested.\n \nThe Wordcoin project, launched officially in June, already has more than 3 million unique users in 120 countries, registering more than 190,000 signups just in the last week.
