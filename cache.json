          "description": "Bitcoin price is soaring at this very moment, now above $43,000 and potentially aiming much higher with a spot ETF approval almost a certainty.\n \nWhile an all-time high in USD terms is still more than $20,000 away, the top cryptocurrency by market cap is about to set a new record high against its arch-nemesis: the banking system.\n \nBitcoin Was Built To Win Against The Banking System\n \nBitcoin was born out of the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. Included in the Genesis block that started the Bitcoin blockchain is a headline from The Times speaking to bank bailouts at the time.\n \nWhile central bankers print money at a whim and inflate the money supply, there will ever only be 21 million BTC. 15 years later, Satoshi’s invention is winning in the war against the traditional banking system.\n \n \nSince the start of the year, there has been weakness in the banking sector due to economic distress, rising interest rates, and a flight of capital from regional banks. The weakness in banks and strength in Bitcoin recently could send BTC versus banks to new all-time highs.\n \n\n \n \nBTCUSD Versus BKX Flirts With New All-Time Highs\n \nPutting BTCUSD up against the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, representing the 24 largest “national money centers, regional banks and thrift institutions,” we can see that Bitcoin is poised to make new all-time highs.\n \nWhile the dollar has been strong in 2022 and 2023, the banking sector has not, hence the discrepancy between BTC trading against the BKX and USD.\n \n \nIn the past, however, all-time highs in the BKX has translated into new record highs on the dollar trading pair, so the price action remains significant.\n \nBitcoin price is currently at $43,700 and climbing, making all-time highs about $25,000 away still. But with an ETF on the way, BTCUSD could catch up soon enough.",

This week, it reached a new milestone with its market capitalization surpassing the $1 billion threshold. The token’s value has soared by 676% in the past month and by 189% in just the last week alone.\n \nORDI Token’s Meteoric Rise\n \nDuring this period of widespread gains in the crypto sector, ORDI, a BRC20 token and the first of its kind built on the Bitcoin network, has achieved a market valuation of $1 billion. As of the latest update, ORDI’s trading price stands at $59 to $61 per unit, marking a significant 189% increase in value against the U.S. dollar. The coin’s trading range for the day has fluctuated between $39.94 and $63, bringing its current market value to $1.22 billion.\n \n\n \nWith a current market valuation of $1.22 billion, ORDI now ranks 57th among the more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies in existence. In addition to its 676% rise over the past month, ORDI has skyrocketed by 1,851% from its all-time low of $2.86 per coin, recorded on September 11, 2023.
