In addition, the governor said the Central Bank of Nigeria’s stringent guidelines help to create a “very safe” banking system. \n \nPriority Given to Depositors\n \nAccording to the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, a recent review of Nigerian banks’ bond portfolios showed that the country’s financial institutions had no direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Emefiele, who made the remarks during a meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee, added that the central bank’s so-called prudential guidelines help to ensure that only healthy banks are allowed to operate.\n \nSome of the guidelines and considerations used by the CBN include banks’ non-performing loans (NPL), which averaged 4.2%, and the capital adequacy ratio of 13.7%. According to Emefiele, these ratios, as well as the banks’ average liquidity and loan-to-deposit ratios of 43% and 52% respectively, indicate that Nigerian banks are “very safe.”\n \n\n \nAlso, in his remarks published by Nairametrics, Emefiele implied that the central bank has and will always prioritize bank customers.\n \n“We will rather dispose of shareholders than make depositors lose money,” Emefiele said.\n \nTo support this claim, Emefiele is quoted in the report stating no Nigerian depositor has lost money to a failed bank since 2003.\n \nRegister your email here to get a weekly update on African news sent to your inbox:\n \n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

Bundchen claimed that she only invested in FTX because her financial advisors recommended it. \n \nBundchen and Brady’s Shareholding in FTX\n \nGisele Bundchen, a fashion model and the estranged wife of former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, has said she only invested in Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX because her financial advisors told her to do so. In remarks published in the Daily Mail, Bundchen suggested that she, just like other FTX investors, was “blindsided” by the crypto exchange’s spectacular collapse.\n \nAccording to the Daily Mail, the celebrity model reportedly held more than 680,000 shares in the collapsed crypto exchange, which were at one point valued at $57 million. Brady, on the other hand, held more than 1.1 million FTX shares when the crypto exchange collapsed. Besides being a shareholder, Bundchen was the crypto exchange’s ambassador and just like Brady, she also appeared in FTX’s Super Bowl advertisement.\n \n\n \nBundchen Says She Wants Justice for FTX Victims\n \nAfter FTX abruptly stopped operating, Bundchen and other celebrities were accused of engaging in deceptive practices. In a billion-dollar lawsuit filed by attorneys Adam Moskowitz and David Boies in Nov. 2022, Oklahoma resident Edwin Garrison also accused the celebrities of promoting unregistered securities.\n \nHowever, despite her role in promoting the crypto exchange, as well as her perceived closeness to Bankman-Fried, Bundchen is quoted in the report claiming she too wants justice to prevail.\n \n“It’s just…terrible. I’m so sorry for all of us that this happened, and I just pray that justice gets made,” the fashion model reportedly said.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
