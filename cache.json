During this period, the network added 22,502 ether, valued at $35.31 million, to its total supply.\n \nEthereum’s Growing Inflation Fueled by Onchain Downturn\n \nPreviously, Ethereum maintained a deflationary stance, primarily due to the London hard fork’s EIP-1559 and the notable shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Yet, the past few months saw a marked decline in onchain activities.\n \nConsequently, the EIP-1559’s fee-burning mechanism has been torching fewer ethers. Just 17 days back, Ethereum’s issuance rate was slightly inflationary, standing at 0.270% annually. But as of now, it hovers around 0.448%, marking a rise of 0.178%.\n \n \nFast forward to September 24…",

The meme coin fell to a seven-week low on Monday, however bulls have moved to buy the dip. Toncoin was another token to rise, reentering the $2.00 region in the process.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) climbed back above a key support level in today’s session, after traders opted to buy a recent dip in price.\n \nAfter slipping to a low of $0.05866 on Tuesday, DOGE/USD rose to an intraday peak at $0.05945 earlier in the session.\n \nAs a result, DOGE continued to move away from a price floor at $0.05840, which was broken on Monday, sending price to its lowest point since mid-August.\n \n \nToday’s rebound comes after the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced away from its own support at 32.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 33.72, which is still close to the oversold region.\n \nThe next visible point of resistance now stands at 37.00, and if broken, there is a good chance that DOGE rises past $0.06000.\n \n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin (TON) was another big gainer on Wednesday, as the token jumped away from a support point of its own.\n \nTON/USD peaked at $2.03 earlier in the day, which came hours after hitting a low at the $1.98 mark.\n \nWednesday’s surge occurred as traders chose to maintain a floor at the $1.95 level, with a ceiling at $2.10 now a possible target.\n \n \nIn order to get there, price strength, which is now sitting at 46.42, will need to break a ceiling at 48.00.\n \nThere will be some difficulty in achieving this however, as the medium-term momentum in TON remains bearish, following last week’s downward crossover of moving averages.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat else could be behind today’s rebound in toncoin?
