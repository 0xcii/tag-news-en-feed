After a mostly bearish weekend, crypto markets eased back into the green to start the week. Shiba inu was a notable exception, as it extended a recent downtrend. \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) continued to move away from a recent support point of $0.5380 on Monday, as bulls’ momentum made a partial return to the market.\n \nAfter trading at a low of $0.5479 on Sunday, MATIC/USD surged to an intraday peak of $0.5624 earlier today.\n \nThe rally saw polygon climb for a third straight day, pushing price closer to a one-week high in the process.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the surge took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 31.00.\n \nAs of writing, price strength is now tracking at 33.61, which is its highest point since August 16.\n \nShould momentum continue to surge, the next target for bulls will likely be around the 43.00 mark.\n \n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) dropped lower for a fifth straight session to start the week, hitting a six-day low in the process.\n \nSHIB/USD fell to a bottom of $0.000007911 earlier in the day, following a high of $0.000008118 the day prior.\n \nHowever, as the day progressed, the cryptocurrency has rallied, and as of writing is currently trading at $0.000008156.\n \n \nThis comes as the RSI bounced from a floor of 40.00, and is now tracking at 43.93, marginally below a ceiling of 45.00.\n \nIn the event that this upcoming resistance point is broken, it is likely SHIB will move past $0.00000850.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCan shiba inu bulls regain market sentiment this week?
