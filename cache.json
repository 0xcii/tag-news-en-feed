In addition to solana, cardano and polygon were also removed. XRP also trended higher in today’s session.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) moved close to the $20.00 level on Friday, despite news that Robinhood was removing the token from its platform.\n \nAccording to reports, the removal will occur on June 27. This comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) determined that several tokens on Coinbase and Binance were securities.\n \nFollowing a low of $18.56 on Thursday, SOL/USD moved to an intraday high of $19.30 during today’s session.\n \n \nToday’s surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) neared a resistance level of 43.00\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.14, with SOL at the $19.08 level.\n \nDespite earlier gains easing after the reports, SOL remains above yesterday’s low.\n \n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, managed to avoid Robinhood’s hit list, surging by over 3% on Friday as a result.\n \nXRP/USD jumped to a peak at $0.5324 earlier in today’s session, which comes less than 24 hours after the price bottomed out at $0.5184.\n \nFriday’s surge in price led to the token briefly breaking out of a key resistance level of $0.5320.\n \n \nThis comes as the RSI collided with a ceiling of its own at 64.00, with bears so far rejecting a breakout.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking marginally lower at 63.50, with longer-term bulls targeting a higher ceiling at 70.00.\n \nShould they reach this point, there is a good chance that XRP will trade close to $0.5800, which was last hit in March.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill Robinhood continue to delist more tokens?
