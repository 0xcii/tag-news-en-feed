A group of attorneys and blockchain engineers are building a new Bitcoin fork blockchain using an emerging legal enforcement protocol that bridges the blockchain to state and federal courts. Called Jurat, the protocol enables capabilities like freezing disputed coins or recovering stolen coins after a hack, all under the auspices of the justice system.

It was more like 90-10 in Ripple’s favor. If Ripple ends up paying $20M or less it’s a 99.9% legal victory.”\n \nEmploying his characteristic humor, Hogan likened his legal musings to resolving a marital disagreement, saying, “I was in a small argument with my wife last night, which means, I am thinking about ‘damages’ this morning.” He then shifted to discuss the legal aspects sur…",
