If this breakout were to play out as the analyst predicts, then the Dogecoin price could be looking at a brand-new all-time high in the next year.\n \nBitcoin Breaking Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern\n \nIn the analysis posted on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, the pseudonymous crypto analyst who goes by the name Trader Tardigrade on the social media platform, pointed out that the Dogecoin price has been in a Falling Wedge. This Falling Wedge has persisted as the price had succumbed to bearish pressure which eventually saw it fall below $0.1.\n \n \nHowever, the bullish part about Falling Wedge patterns like the one observed on the Dogecoin chart is when the price…",
