The drops came as the wider crypto market cap also slipped. It is trading 2.87% lower as of writing. Shiba inu also edged lower in today’s session.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) fell by as much as 3% on Tuesday, as bearish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets.\n \nDOGE/USD dropped to a low of $0.06163 earlier in the day, following a high of $0.06329 the day prior.\n \nThe decline came as the meme coin failed to move beyond a key resistance level at the $0.0640 level.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the downward pressure came after the relative strength index (RSI) slipped below a floor at 47.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 44.37, with the 40.00 mark a potential target for sellers.\n \nShould this point be hit, there is a strong possibility that dogecoin will be trading below the $0.06000 region.\n \n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nIn addition to DOGE, shiba inu (SHIB) also edged lower today, as prices approached a key support point.\n \nFollowing a high at $0.000007479, SHIB/USD declined to a bottom at $0.000007258 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of this surge, the world’s second largest meme coin closed in on a price floor at the $0.00000710 level.\n \n \nWhilst SHIB has not hit this point yet, the RSI has collided with a floor of its own at the 43.00 mark.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking marginally below this point at 42.88, however should this downward trend continue, SHIB will almost certainly hit $0.00000710 in the coming days.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect meme coins to rebound this week?

This is the first major non-consensus update to the Bitcoin reference implementation in quite a while, and is going to have a lot of interesting implications for users bootstrapping nodes. \nTo give a little context about the feature, I think it'll be useful to give a little history lesson. When a Bitcoin Core node first turns on and starts syncing the blockchain it doesn't actually validate the entire historical chain. It can, but it doesn't by default, the reason being to save time and resources when bootstrapping. It validates the entire set of blockchain headers to make sure the proof-of-work is valid, but it doesn't actuall…",
