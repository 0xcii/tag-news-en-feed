The judge found that the operators of the facility were in contempt of another judge's court order.\nUnder the agreement, US Bitcoin would be required to comply with a series of standards for noise reduction and permit applications. These include limiting noise production from the facility to no more than 65 decibels and submitting completed applications for all permits needed to comply with the city's new “high energy usage overlay district,” the report details.\n\nThey would also have to compensate the city in several ways, including paying an upfront, non-refundable $50,000 fee upon execution of the agreement. In addition to the $50,000 upfront fee, US Bitcoin would be required to pay the city a $100,000 compliance fee within 30 days of the agreement's effective date.\nThe company would also be required to reimburse the city for $180,000 in attorney fees and costs tied to its enforcement action against the company, as listed in the agreement.\nThe Niagara Falls City Council still has to approve the agreement.",

Avalanche was also in the green, as prices hit a one-week high.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was a notable gainer in today’s session, as prices continued to move away from a recent support point.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.4972 on Tuesday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.5256 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThis came as bulls continued to move away from a floor at $0.49500, following a breakout earlier in the week.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it appears that this took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a support of its own at 59.00 .\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 61.24, with the next visible ceiling at the 63.00 mark.\n \nAs a result of this upcoming hurdle, earlier bulls have already moved to liquidate gains, with XRP now trading lower at $0.5137.\n \n \nAvalanche (AVAX)\n \nAnother notable gainer on Tuesday was avalanche (AVAX), which moved to a one-week high.\n \nAVAX/USD moved to a peak at $18.31 earlier in today’s session, after falling to a low of $17.29 the day prior.\n \nThe surge saw avalanche climb to its strongest point since March 23, and came following a move beyond a ceiling at $18.00.\n \n \nSince then, earlier gains have somewhat fallen as a result of the RSI hitting a wall at the 56.00 level.\n \nPrice strength is now tracking at 55.63, which has resulted in AVAX once again trading below $18.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect avalanche to move back above $18.00 this week?
