          "description": "The Bitcoin and crypto market is starting into a very quiet week today in terms of upcoming events. Both crypto related events as well as notable macro data are very scarce this week. The most important macro data are the ISM Services PMI (on Wednesday 10:00 am EST) and the initial jobless claims (on Thursday at 8:30 am EST). However, neither event is likely to have a significant impact on the dollar index (DXY) and thus Bitcoin and crypto.\n \nDue to this, we are making an exception this Monday and looking at the entire month of September rather than the upcoming seven days in our weekly preview. September holds several extremely important events in store, and could also provide a few surprises.\n \n#1 Bitcoin Spot ETF Decision?\n \nThe spot Bitcoin ETF approval is still the most important cata…",
