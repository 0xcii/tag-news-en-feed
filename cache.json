While you can still withdraw your sats, creating new or refilling existing Lightning wallets on LndHub node will no longer be possible.”\nThe post proceeds to request that users remove funds from their BlueWallet custodial Lightning wallets as soon as possible. It is also made clear that regular BlueWallet Bitcoin wallets will not be impacted by this change, nor will self-custody Lightning wallets –– where users connect to their own Lndhub.\n“Lndhub started as a weekend experiment on a new fringe technology barely used at the time called the Lightning Network,” the blog explains. “Today, with the availability of more mainstream services offering scalable solutions, Lndhub has fulfilled its purpose in its current form.”\nUsers will still be able to access Lndhub as a software and self-hosted solution, able to connect to their own LndHub from BlueWallet or other software that supports the LndHub API specification.\nThe post concludes with an optimistic take, saying that “This may sound like bad news, but this essentially means BlueWallet going forward will only support self-custody solutions. This is good for bitcoin and BlueWallet users.”",

The charges include operating an unlicensed money transfer business and conspiring to commit bank fraud.\n \nSBF Gets 4 New Charges Tacked Onto His Indictment\n \nThe former CEO of FTX was originally indicted 72 days ago by a federal grand jury in Manhattan, and prosecutors charged the crypto exchange co-founder with eight different offenses. The charges include conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n \nA new indictment was unsealed by the court on February 22, 2023, adding four new charges to SBF’s case. The charges include operating an unlicensed money transmitter and conspiracy to commit bank fraud. “Exploiting the trust that FTX customers placed in him and his exchange, Bankman-Fried stole FTX customer deposits and used billions of dollars in stolen funds for a variety of purposes,” the new indictment reads.\n \nThe newly revised indictment did not name any other defendants, and it alleges that SBF “corrupted the operations of the cryptocurrency companies he founded and controlled—including FTX.com and Alameda Research.” The revised indictment further adds that SBF “perpetrated this multibillion-dollar fraud through a series of systems and schemes that allowed him, through Alameda, to access and steal FTX customer deposits without detection.”\n \n\n \nIn addition to operating an unlicensed money transfer business and bank fraud, SBF is accused of defrauding customers in connection with the purchase and sale of derivatives. Furthermore, SBF faces a charge of making unlawful political contributions and defrauding the Federal Election Commission.\n \nWhat impact do you think these new charges will have on SBF’s case?
