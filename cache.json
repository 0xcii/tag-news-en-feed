Rather than being backed by fiat currency or a basket of assets, flatcoins are pegged to purchasing power or the Consumer Price Index (CPI). \n \nThis means that the value of a flatcoin would fluctuate to reflect changes in the cost of goods and services, making it potentially more resilient to inflation and economic fluctuations.\n \n …",

The capital raised will be used to bolster Nestcoin’s finances and further develop the startup’s non-custodial wallet. \n \nImpact of FTX’s Collapse on Nestcoin\n \nThe Nigerian Web3 startup Nestcoin recently secured $1.9 million via a strategic funding round which was led by Hashed Emergent, a report has said. Existing investors that participated in the round include Alter Global, Magic Fund, CMT Digital, and 4DX Ventures while Adaverse and Base Ecosystem Fund were the two new investors.\n \nThe startup’s latest fundraising success came almost a year after it lost access to a stash of stablecoins which were held at the now defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX. As reported by Bitcoin.com News in November 2022, Nestcoin initially responded to the loss of access to digital assets worth millions of dollars by reducing its employee headcount.\n \n \nAccording to a Techcrunch report, the loss of access to funds also forced Nestcoin to re-evaluate its business model. Commenting on what the re-evaluation process has done for the startup, Yele Bademosi, the CEO of Nestcoin, said:\n \n“During this transition period, we were trying to make the best decision when there were no good decisions. It helped that we were open and transparent with our investors and community. We had to make tough decisions regarding cutting product lines. We had to transition from a venture studio and investment holding company to a single-product company.”\n \nMeanwhile, the report revealed that Nestcoin is planning not only to use the raised funds to bolster its finances but also to develop its non-custodial wallet further.\n \nRegister your email here to get a weekly update on African news sent to your inbox:\n \n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
