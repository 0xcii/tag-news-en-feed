Additionally, we ended the month with $133.8 million in unrestricted cash on hand.” \nMarathon Digital has accrued one of the largest public bitcoin holdings in the industry, second only to Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy. According to the firm’s update, the sale was not made out of any form of distress, but was a strategic financial move. \n“In prior press releases and earnings calls, Marathon has indicated that the Company intends to sell a portion of its bitcoin holdings to cover operational expenses as production begins to ramp,” the update states. “With production improving, Marathon opted to sell 1,500 BTC during January 2023.”\nMarathon, like other bitcoin miners, had to weather a 2022 that saw various industry challenges, from increasing electricity prices to widespread contagion that decimated the price of bitcoin. \nDespite these challenges, the update explained the optimistic position of the company, saying, “As we look ahead, our focus for the year is to energize more miners and to optimize their performance. We remain confident in our ability to scale Marathon into one of the largest and most energy efficient Bitcoin mining operations globally by installing approximately 23 exahashes of computing power near the middle of 2023.”",
