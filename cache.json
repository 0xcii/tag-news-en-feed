The Hub is a one-click install Lightning Node application that aims to make self-custodial Lightning use as painless as possible. Users can sign up to join the waitlist here. \nAlby Hub integrates a one click Lightning node, a self-custodial Lightning wallet, and an app store that enables easy connection between a user’s Lightning wallet and other applications such as Damus, Stacker News, podcast apps, and external Lightning wallets to control their nodes with. \nEasy migration from Alby’s web wallet to Alby Hub is supported. \nThere will also be an Alby Hub Cloud plan for 21k satoshis a month to easily spin up an Alby Hub instance run in the Alby Cloud. The plan includes live channel management support and setup support, and access to the Alby Buzz community. Alby Hub will also be made available as a DIY tool to install on your own desktop or server. It will even be possible to run on a Raspberry Pi Zero. \nAlby Hub was developed to remove the friction in running your own self-custodial Lightning Node. Given the dominance of custodial Lightning solutions in the space currently, the goal of Alby Hub is to make it as painless as possible for users to manage their own Lightning funds in a self custodial environment, making them a truly sovereign Lightning user. \nMichael Bumann, the founder of Alby, had this to say: \n“At Alby, we always focused on building tools and protocols to natively use the Lightning Network on the web like the Alby Extension, which changed the way Lightning is used in web browsers. With Alby Hub, we are now taking Lightning Network self-custody to the next level by rethinking the utility behind running a lightning node. What does a node and wallet look like that can integrate with any bitcoin-powered app with just a few clicks? With Alby Hub, users now have endless possibilities for self-sovereign payments on the web without the technical overhead.”\nJoin the waitlist here now.",

          "description": "Luxury sports car manufacturer Ferrari announced it will expand the ability to pay with Bitcoin and crypto to its European dealerships starting this month. The move comes after Ferrari first began accepting Bitcoin and crypto payments at its US dealers last year.\n\nJUST IN: Luxury Cars Manufacturer Ferrari to accept #Bitcoin and crypto payments in Europe. pic.twitter.com/PxT7Z7OwbP\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 24, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nFerrari said the rollout to Europe will occur by the end of July, enabling customers to purchase new vehicles using Bitcoin and crypto. The company plans to expand the Bitcoin payment option to dealers worldwide by the end of 2024, where legally permitted.\nFerrari continues its partnership with leading Bitcoin payments processor BitPay to process the payments. When a purchase is made in Bitcoin, BitPay instantly converts it to traditional fiat currency for Ferrari's dealers to remove exposure to Bitcoin and crypto volatility.\nThe ability to pay with Bitcoin and other crypto caters to Ferrari's tech-savvy customer base with sizeable Bitcoin wealth. It also taps into growing mainstream adoption, as more major companies accept Bitcoin payments including Microsoft, AT&T, and travel site Expedia.\nFerrari said accepting Bitcoin and crypto provides customers with additional flexibility and convenience in purchasing the company's luxury vehicles. The automaker saw strong demand after enabling Bitcoin payments in the US last year.\nAs luxury and high-end brands adopt Bitcoin payments, it helps legitimize the asset class as a currency and not just an investment. The ability of consumers to spend Bitcoin at more retailers was also cited as a factor in the recent Bitcoin market rally.",
