The decline came as crypto bank Silvergate confirmed that it will be winding down operations. Ethereum also edged lower.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) fell for a fourth straight session on Thursday, as markets reacted to news that Silvergate Bank will be liquidating its operations.\n \nFollowing a high of $22,198.90 on Wednesday, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $21,609.99 earlier today.\n \nThe decline in price pushed bitcoin to its lowest point since February 13, when it traded at a bottom of $21,366.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, this latest sell-off coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) falling to its lowest point since November 28.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 36.86, which is marginally below its support point at 37.00.\n \nDespite this, BTC remains above its own floor at $21,600, and should this zone hold steady, there is a chance prices could rebound heading into the weekend.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) also remained in the red in today’s session, registering a third consecutive drop in price.\n \nETH/USD moved to a low of $1,530.43 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $1,563.41.\n \nSimilar to bitcoin, this drop resulted in the world’s second largest cryptocurrency slipping to its weakest level since mid-February.\n \n \nOverall, ethereum is down nearly 7% in the past seven days, and this comes as the 10-day (red) moving average extended a crossover of its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nAs of writing, the RSI is also tracking at a multi-month low at 40.57, which was last hit on December 19.\n \nShould this trend continue, there is a strong possibility that ETH could fall to a floor at $1,500.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nIs there a possibility that ethereum could rebound this week?
