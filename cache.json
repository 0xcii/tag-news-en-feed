          "description": "Two prominent crypto industry groups, the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Freedom Alliance (CFAT) of Texas, have filed a lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to contest a newly implemented rule expanding the definition of a “dealer” in securities. \n \nThe complaint, lodged in a federal court in Texas, alleges that the SEC exceeded its authority and approved an arbitrary and capricious rule.\n \nCrypto Industry Takes Legal Action Against SEC\n \nIn the lawsuit, the crypto firms argue that the new rule is “vague, overly broad” and fails to provide clarity on its implications for crypto market participants. \n \nIn particular, under the SEC rule, developers of automated software and liquidity providers for certain trading protocols could fall within the definition of…",
