The bank moved to increase rates by 50 basis points, despite the recent banking crisis. As a result of this many now expect that the Federal Reserve will continue to increase rates also.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) fell by over 5% on Thursday, as markets reacted to the latest interest rate decision from the ECB.\n \nMany believe the Federal Reserve could take a similar approach, hiking rates despite the recent turmoil within the banking system.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.07313, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday low of $0.06814 earlier in today’s session.\n \n \nAs a result of the decline, DOGE was once again trading below a key price floor at the $0.07000 mark.\n \nThe decline comes as bears snapped a five-day win streak on Wednesday, with some of this sentiment carrying over to today.\n \nThe catalyst for this appears to be a failed breakout of the ceiling at the 44.00 level on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).\n \n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nIn addition to DOGE, shiba inu (SHIB) was also in the red in today’s session, with prices trading close to a key price floor.\n \nSHIB/USD slipped to a low of $0.00001024 earlier in the day, which comes a day after hitting a high of $0.00001098.\n \nThursday’s drop in price has seen the meme coin close in on a long-term support point at the $0.00001020 mark.\n \n \nHowever, a collision was averted, as the RSI bounced from a floor of its own, at the 38.00 zone.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 39.13, with an interim resistance at 41.00 a possible target.\n \nShiba inu has now marginally recovered from earlier lows, and as of writing, is trading at $0.00001049.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill the Federal Reserve increase rates?
