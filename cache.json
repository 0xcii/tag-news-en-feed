The bot made it possible for DOGE users to easily tip their favorite creators without much hassle, and with this ease of use, promoted the adoption of the meme coin. However, it seems Twitter no longer wants the bot on its platform.\n \nTwitter Suspends Dogecoin Tipping Bot\n \nOn Wednesday, Doge Designer on Twitter drew attention to the fact that the Dogecoin tipping bot had been suspended on Twitter. The bot which uses the hand @MyDogeTip was seemingly suspended earlier in the week with no explanation as to why.\n \n \nTo this end, Doge Designer tried to draw the attention of Elon Musk to the suspension. The account now displays the generic “Twitter suspends accounts that violate the Twitter Rules”…",
