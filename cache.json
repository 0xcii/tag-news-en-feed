Noting that he already warned of this giant crash in his Rich Dad’s Prophecy book, the famous author stressed: “This next crash may turn into a depression.”\n \nRobert Kiyosaki on Giant Crash and a Depression\n \nThe author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has once again sounded the alarm about the U.S. economy. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.\n \nKiyosaki wrote on social media platform X Wednesday: “Soft landing is a fantasy. Crash landing more likely. I warned of this giant crash in my book Rich Dad’s Prophecy pub 2012.” He continued:\n \n\nThis next crash may turn into a depression.\n \nThe renowned author also shared in an X post on Sunday that the Israel-Hamas war has motivated him to buy an electric vehicle. “The war is about oil,” he said. “Higher gas prices will make the poor poorer.” He proceeded to reiterate his recommendation of buying gold, silver, and bitcoin, which he believes to be the best investment for unstable times.\n \n \nThe well-known author has repeatedly expressed concerns about challenging times ahead for the U.S. economy. Last week, he similarly cautioned about a possible next Great Depression and a war, predicting “really hard times ahead” for millions of people. Kiyosaki also previously warned of the “greatest real estate crash ever,” emphasizing that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes will also crash stocks, bonds, and the U.S. dollar.\n \nWhat do you think about the warnings by Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki about the next crash turning into a depression?

          "description": "After the notable appearance of a mega whale on December 4, another block reward from the Satoshi era was moved on December 7, at a block height of 820,156. This transaction marks the 21st block reward from 2010 to be spent in the initial week of December.\n \nSleeping Bitcoin Stash Stirs After a Decade\n \n\n \nOn Thursday, December 7, 2023, a dormant stash of 50 bitcoin (BTC) stirred into action for the first time in over ten years. This movement of the so-called ‘sleeping bitcoins’ was detected by the blockchain parsing platform btcparser.com. Echoing the activity seen on December 4, where a series of 20 blocks were utilized, the original address divided the funds between two separate Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) addresses.\n \n\n \nThe originating address, known as “18JkK,” was established on July 24, 2010. From this, it transferred 1 BTC to the address labeled “32Xas” and a further 48.99 BTC to “3DD4X.” Nevertheless, the transaction was conspicuous in terms of privacy, garnering a low privacy score of 5 out of 100 from Blockchair’s privacy analysis tool. This was attributed to identifiable issues like matched inputs and outputs.\n \n\n \nWhile the transfer of 50 BTC may seem modest compared to the 1,000 BTC moved by the spender of 20 block rewards on December 4, its current value of $2.18 million is striking, especially when contrasted with its July 2010 worth of just $15. Moreover, instances of moving bitcoins from 2010 have become notably scarce in 2023, with more frequent sightings of 2012-era bitcoins.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe specific block reward, number 69,986, spent on that Thursday marked its first movement in over a decade. Importantly, it wasn’t part of the collection of block rewards linked to Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Notably, Satoshi was active during that July but departed the community permanently in December 2010.\n \n\n \nWhat do you think about the 2010 block reward awakenings in December?
