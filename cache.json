The proposal was ostensibly seen as a step towards modernizing financial regulation, and has sparked backlash in the crypto community.\n \nThe proposed rule by the CFPB seeks to define a market for general-use digital consumer payment applications.

Pushing things off-chain is attempting to make the use of the scarce resource that blockspace is much more efficient to accommodate a materially larger user base than the blockchain can facilitate on its own. Jevon’s Paradox states that in the presence of elastic demand for something, when the efficiency of using that thing increases, i.e. the cost per use decreases, the aggregate demand for that thing among participants will increase. \nThe typical example given is the fuel efficiency of cars. If cars suddenly become twice as efficient at using gasoline, people will travel more as the cost of travel has been cut in half. With people traveling more often beca…",
