And could this bigger cycle reflect the way humans adopt new technologies? And is it possible we have seen something similar before with another technology like the internet? In this article, we will be diving into a new theory that suggests that Bitcoin is moving through a larger 16-year cycle which can help us predict the direction of the Bitcoin price in the coming years. \nThe Regular 4 Year Cycle\nBitcoin tends to go through 4-year cycles which are divided into 2 parts, the uptrend and the downtrend.
