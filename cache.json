Here’s how much percentage of the network is sustainable today.\n \n52.6% Of The Bitcoin Mining Network Is Now Using Sustainable Energy\n \nOne of the most talked about controversies around cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has been their potential negative impact on the environment. BTC uses a “proof-of-work” (PoW) consensus system to validate transactions on the blockchain. This means that chain validators called miners compete against each other using vast amounts of computing power to be the first to solve a mathematical puzzle and get to set transfers in the next block.\n \nMiners require specialized computing units for this purpose which can be power-hungry.

The MDK as Block “currently envisions it” would have four components:\n\nA “powerful, reliable, industrial-grade” bitcoin mining hashboard.\nA custom controller board designed to work with the hashboard.\nOpen-source firmware, a software API and a web front-end, that would allow developers to modify the key performance parameters of the hashboard.\nAnd extensive reference materials and support documentation “to facilitate easy customization of the hashboard.”\n\n“The intention behind the MDK is to provide developers with a suite of tools to help unlock creativity and innovation in bitcoin mining hardware,” describes the blog. “With the MDK, we see a significant opportunity to increase the accessibility and openness of bitcoin mining hardware, in order to accelerate innovation in the field.”\nThe post ends with a promise of future updates in the coming weeks and months, and a call to action for feedback that can be directed to mining@block.xyz.",

          "description": "DC Circuit judges hammered the SEC’s lawyers as they defended their decision to not approve Grayscale’s move toward a spot bitcoin ETF.\nGrayscale Investments LLC participated in oral arguments on Tuesday in the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in relation to its attempts to get its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) converted to a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). In these oral arguments, the three presiding judges seemingly sided with Grayscale in their positioning.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly denied previous attempts at the introduction of a spot bitcoin ETF. This has led to Grayscale suing the SEC, alleging that the decisions have been arbitrary and inconsistent with the Commission's decision to approve Bitcoin futures ETFs. \nIn today’s arguments, presiding judges Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan and Judge Neomi Rao continually prodded the SEC Senior Counsel Emily Parise about the SEC’s differentiation between a futures ETF and a spot bitcoin ETF. \n“[The prices] move together 99.9% of the time. So where's the gap, in the Commission's view?” asked Judge Rao. \nThe SEC response was that correlation does not equal causation, with its lawyers explaining that the key empirical question is whether fraud and manipulation in the spot markets affect futures in the same way so that they can rely on the surveillance of the future markets. Without that missing empirical piece, the SEC counsel said, the agency can't be sure it can rely on CME future surveillance to approve a spot ETF. \nQuestioning led to the pontification that the SEC had not provided sufficient evidence to explain their decision making, with Judge Rao telling Parise, “The SEC has not offered any explanation that the petitioners are wrong.”\nThe full record of the questioning can be listened to here.",
