Straten has provided an estimation for the cost of a 51% attack on the BTC blockchain. A “51% attack” in the context of Bitcoin is when a single group takes control of more than 50% of the hashrate on the network and thus, effectively gains hold of the blockchain as a whole.\n \nThe “hashrate” here refers to a measure of the total amount of computing power that the miners have connected to the BTC network right now.
