Starting the year with a market value of $66.3 billion on January 1, 2023, it has surged to $90 billion in 340 days. This expansion represents more than a 35% increase, adding $23.7 billion to USDT’s market capitalization since the year’s commencement.\n \nTether’s market capitalization now represents 5.369% of the total $1.68 trillion crypto economy. Not only does tether hold the third position among over 10,000 digital currencies in terms of market valuation, but it also leads in daily trading volume with $23 billion. USDT’s principal trading pairs involve major fiat currencies such as the USD, EUR, TRY, MXN, and THB.\n \nWhile year-to-date data indicates a more than 35% rise in USDT’s market cap, 5.5% of this upswing occurred in the preceding month. According to Tether’s transparency page, of the $90 billion total, the Tron network accounts for $47.82 billion and Ethereum for $41.01 billion, with the remainder distributed across various other blockchain platforms.\n \n \nLooking back to March 16, 2015, USDT’s market value was a modest $251,000. Over eight years, the coin’s market cap has soared by a massive 35,912,812%. Tether’s aggregate market valuation is on the brink of entering the world’s top 100 assets, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and companies, in terms of market capitalization. In order to achieve this feat, USDT will need a market cap of more than $130 billion.\n \nWhat do you think about the stablecoin tether and its market cap growing to $90 billion?

Reports indicate that he is indeed set to be extradited to the United States, with a senior Montenegrin justice official privately confirming the extradition plans. \n \nThis development follows Kwon’s legal team’s unsuccessful attempts to circumvent the extradition process, including their appeal of a late November decision approving the extradition.\n \nThe charges against Kwon were brought forth by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in February. The Terra Luna founder stands accused of orchestrating a multibillion-dollar crypto asset securities fraud. \n \n \nWith Do Kwon’s extradition imminent, a trial will likely ensue to address the crimes he committed during his tenure as the head of Terra Luna.\n \n \nFeatured image from Reuters, chart from TradingView.com",
