The support will start with Bitcoin token standard and stamps (SRC-20) on Feb. 5, followed by atomicals (ARC-20), runes, and dogecoin’s doginals (DRC-20) later in the same month.\n \n\n \nAccording to a statement, Okx will also add DRC-20, ARC-20, and Runes standards to its marketplace in late February, enabling users to trade these inscriptions with zero fees. The Web3 firm has said its ultimate goal is to help drive the adoption of Web3 and power its next growth phase.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCommenting on the addition of new inscription standards, which make Okx one of the leading one-stop inscriptions ecosystems in Web3, Okx Chief Technology Officer Jason Lau said:\n \n\n \n“Okx strives to drive mainstream adoption of technologies on the leading edge of Web3, and our new inscriptions ecosystem is evidence of our commitment to this mission. By empowering users to easily buy, sell, create, and trade leading token standards on one platform with zero trading fees, Okx is simplifying access and removing barriers so users can explore and realize the potential of inscriptions.”\n \n\n \nAs per the statement, the Okx wallet’s inscriptions tool already supports the minting of inscriptions on 23 networks, including Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche-C, and Arbitrum One. In addition, the Web3 company’s inscription offering is said to be the industry’s most advanced, with liquidity across multiple inscription standards.\n \n\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

The Chumps FOMO [fear of missing out] buy the Pump only to puke out their purchases with the Dump.” Brandt opined:\n \n\nIt is the Hump…Slump…Pump…Dump that keeps a bull trend healthy. Let’s see if HSPD works its magic once again.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBrandt regularly provides analysis of bitcoin’s price. He has also made several bullish statements about the cryptocurrency. On Jan. 18, he wrote on X: “I have a macro bias in bitcoin in a very broad sense — that BTC is a best candidate to be a tremendous store of value against the destruction of fiat.” On Jan. 6, he wrote: “Bitcoin is primary a store-of-value IMO and still has massive opportunities to appreciate. I think everything is junk, including ETH.”\n \n\n \nHowever, the trader is skeptical about the impact of the Bitcoin halving on the price of BTC. On Dec. 21 last year, he explained on X: “The Bitcoin halving hype is a whole lot of excitement over nothing. Sure, halving hype might temporarily impact price. But the reduction of supply as % of daily volume is the size of a gnat’s ass.”\n \n\n \nWhat do you think about Peter Brandt’s bitcoin price analysis? Do you think a bitcoin bull run is coming soon?
