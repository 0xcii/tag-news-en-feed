Paypal detailed that the stablecoin asset will be available to select Venmo users and fully roll out for all users “in the coming weeks.”\n \nPaypal Stablecoin PYUSD Makes Its Way to Venmo\n \nPaypal has disclosed that Venmo users can now leverage the firm’s proprietary stablecoin, PYUSD. The rollout is starting with select Venmo users, but soon all Venmo customers will be able to “able to purchase PYUSD and send it to friends and family on Paypal, Venmo, and compatible external wallets.”\n \nThe company notes that transfers between Paypal users and Venmo are “fast and free,” with the exception of blockchain network fees. PYUSD is an ERC20 token, which means the coin is subject to fees associated with the Ethereum fee market and block space.\n \nFor example, etherscan.io indicates that the cost to transfer an ERC20 token on September 20, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. (ET), ranges from $2.65 to $2.91 per transaction. Paypal further mentions in the announcement that PYUSD is now available on various platforms, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Kraken, MetaMask, Ledger, Phantom, Bitpay, and Fireblocks, among others.\n \nThe payments company also highlights its recent approval by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The latest development comes on the heels of PYUSD’s first transparency report, which unveiled the backing of cash and U.S. Treasury reverse repurchase agreements as reserves.\n \n \nAs of September 20, approximately 44.37 million PYUSD coins are in circulation. A total of 698 distinct addresses currently hold PYUSD, with these wallets collectively executing 3,354 transfers since the currency’s launch. Additionally, the top 100 holders jointly possess 99.96% of the PYUSD supply, equivalent to 44,358,474.05 PYUSD tokens.\n \nWhat do you think about PYUSD being supported by Venmo?

Hirsch discussed crypto assets and exchanges Tuesday at an SEC forum in Chicago.\n \nSEC Crypto Head Forewarns Tougher Enforcement\n \nWhile the crypto community has focused on the XRP case and lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may target more violators soon. David Hirsch, head of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, made the statements, as reported by Coindesk.\n \nOn Tuesday at the Securities Enforcement Forum Central in Chicago, Hirsch said the SEC will “continue to bring those charges.”\n \n“We’re going to continue to be active as to intermediaries,” Hirsch told the audience. “That can be brokers, dealers, exchanges, clearing agencies or any others who are active in this space, are within our jurisdiction and not meeting their obligations, either through registration or failure to provide adequate or complete disclosures.”\n \n \nThe SEC has cracked down on several high-profile crypto companies such as Binance, Bittrex US, and Coinbase. More recently it has been focused on a couple of non-fungible token (NFT) projects that raised millions without disclosure.\n \nHirsch insists more enforcement is coming. “We’re going to continue to conduct investigations, we’re gonna be active in the space, and adding the label of [decentralized finance] is not going to be something that’s going to deter us from continuing our work,” the SEC official remarked.\n \nThe SEC official noted the regulator has significant ongoing litigation. Beyond enforcement actions against exchanges and brokers, the market capitalization of crypto coins that the SEC claims are crypto securities stands at $85.4 billion.\n \nWhat do you think about the SEC’s crypto chief and his statements at the forum in Chicago?
