He expects the next crash to be the “$1 quadrillion derivatives market.”\n \nRobert Kiyosaki on Interest Rate Hikes, Market Crashes\n \nThe author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, reiterated his warnings of market crashes and the danger of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates this week. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.\n \nKiyosaki tweeted Thursday:\n \n\nRaising interest rates will crash stocks, bonds, real estate, & $ U.S. dollar. Next crash: $1 quadrillion derivatives market. $1 quadrillion is $1 thousand trillion.\n \nThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) on Wednesday. While a number of people expect the Fed to start cutting rates soon, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that rate cuts are not in the Fed’s base case.\n \n \nThis was not the first time Kiyosaki has warned about stocks, bonds, real estate, and the U.S. dollar crashing. Last week, the famous author discussed a “crash landing ahead” as bank bailouts began following the collapse of major banks, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. He also predicted the end of the U.S. dollar, calling the USD “fake money.”\n \nThe renowned author also recently predicted that the world economy is on the verge of collapse, expecting bank runs, frozen savings, and bail-ins. In February, he said that everything will crash. Earlier this year, he said we are in a global recession, warning of soaring bankruptcies, unemployment, and homelessness.\n \nWhat do you think about Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki’s crash warnings?

          "description": "The crypto asset xrp rose by as much as 5% on Saturday, following declines of a similar amount during yesterday’s session. This comes despite the global crypto market cap moving lower, falling by 0.51% at the time of writing. Litecoin was also higher to start the weekend.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was back in the green on Saturday, as the token rebounded from Friday’s losses.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.418, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4501 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move came as bullish momentum increased at the price floor of $0.4250, after bears failed to sustain an earlier breakout.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the rebound took place as the relative strength index (RSI) moved away from its own support, at 58.00\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 60.77, and seems to be heading towards a ceiling at the 63.00 mark.\n \nThe 10-day (red) moving average has also extended its upward cross versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could be a sign of upcoming gains.\n \n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nLitecoin (LTC), was another notable mover to start the weekend, as prices remained close to a multi-week high.\n \nLTC/USD climbed to a peak of $93.97 on Saturday, which comes less than 24 hours after a low of $89.87.\n \nAs a result of this, litecoin is now trading close to a ceiling of $94.00, and a recent three-week high of $96.11.\n \n \nOne catalyst for the rally was a recent crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.\n \nIn addition to this, the RSI is now tracking at 57.07, which is marginally above a resistance level of 56.00.\n \nShould bullish momentum continue to rise, there is a strong possibility that LTC will move beyond $100.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect litecoin to move higher in the upcoming days?

In addition, the governor said the Central Bank of Nigeria’s stringent guidelines help to create a “very safe” banking system. \n \nPriority Given to Depositors\n \nAccording to the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, a recent review of Nigerian banks’ bond portfolios showed that the country’s financial institutions had no direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Emefiele, who made the remarks during a meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee, added that the central bank’s so-called prudential guidelines help to ensure that only healthy banks are allowed to operate.\n \nSome of the guidelines and considerations used by the CBN include banks’ non-performing loans (NPL), which averaged 4.2%, and the capital adequacy ratio of 13.7%. According to Emefiele, these ratios, as well as the banks’ average liquidity and loan-to-deposit ratios of 43% and 52% respectively, indicate that Nigerian banks are “very safe.”\n \n\n \nAlso, in his remarks published by Nairametrics, Emefiele implied that the central bank has and will always prioritize bank customers.\n \n“We will rather dispose of shareholders than make depositors lose money,” Emefiele said.\n \nTo support this claim, Emefiele is quoted in the report stating no Nigerian depositor has lost money to a failed bank since 2003.\n \nRegister your email here to get a weekly update on African news sent to your inbox:\n \n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
