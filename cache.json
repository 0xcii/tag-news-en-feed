The association's vision extends towards empowering local talent across various sectors to leverage Bitcoin and foster their initiatives.\nStartups Primal.net and PeakShift have played pivotal roles in realizing HUB21's vision and by giving their support. The launch of HUB21's website offers a gateway to a diverse range of upcoming events, which can be viewed here.",
