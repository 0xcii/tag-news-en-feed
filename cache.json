Because we invest at the early stages of a new technology’s development, we invest in equity rather than tokens, only receiving tokens on a pro-rata basis. We firmly believe that for a token to be valid, it should serve a crucial role; in essence, removing the token should disrupt the core value proposition and underlying architecture. Merely having tokens for their sake, or avoiding them without reason, raises immediate red flags. In much of Web3, there's an overflow of tokens made just to have a token. Projects which may have otherwise succeeded but fail due to their token’s economic unsustainability and lead to significant financial losses for investors.
