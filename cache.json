This latest acquisition further cements MicroStrategy's position as one of the most prominent institutional investors in Bitcoin.\nThe move comes as no surprise to those following MicroStrategy's journey in the world of cryptocurrencies. The company first ventured into Bitcoin investments in August 2020 when it made its initial purchase. Since then, it has continued to accumulate Bitcoin, even using debt to finance some of its acquisitions.\nAll the while, Saylor has continued to assert that Bitcoin is \"underestimated\" compared to other crypto market opportunities, as this video from Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo shows. Saylor has repeatedly said that altcoins are overvalued and should be sold.\nWith the growing recognition of Bitcoin's value as a store of value and a potential hedge against economic uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether more institutions will follow in MicroStrategy's footsteps.",
