Additionally, this month marked a record in fee collection, with miners securing $324.83 million in onchain transaction fees.\n \nBitcoin Miners Smash Records — Highest Monthly Haul of $1.51 Billion in December 2023\n \n\n \nDecember 2023 has set a new benchmark for monthly revenue garnered by bitcoin (BTC) miners through block discovery and transaction verification. By Dec. 31, 2023, a total of $1.51 billion was amassed, including $324.83 million in onchain fees. This surpasses the former monthly revenue record set in May, where miners collected a total of $919.22 million, with $125.92 million from onchain fees.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nIn July, miners collected a total of $865 million, with $19.21 million from fees. December, however, marked a significant increase, standing 1.64 times greater than May’s record, representing a growth of 64.27% or an additional $590.78 million. At the moment, according to bitinfocharts.com, December’s onchain transaction rates are soaring, with the average fee at 231 satoshis per virtual byte (sats/vB) or $20.86 per transaction.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nOn Dec. 31, 2023, the median-sized fee is noted at $9.60 per transaction or 106.3 sats/vB. Moreover, on Dec. 17, 2023, fees spiked to as much as $40 per transfer, averaging around $37.43 per transaction — the year’s peak in on-chain fees, surpassing the previous high of $31 on May 8, 2023.\n \n\n \nAlso, on Dec. 17, the hash price of Bitcoin — the value of a single petahash per second (PH/s) produced daily — hit a 2023 zenith of $133.62 per PH/s, exceeding the earlier record of $125.64 per PH/s on May 8. Despite the high onchain fees, miners face a backlog of over 496,000 unconfirmed transactions and congestion of 430 blocks.\n \n\n \nWhat do you think about the record-breaking haul bitcoin miners gathered in December 2023?

While the crypto asset lost 41% over the two-week span and more than 20% this past week, BONK is still up by 272% over the last 30 days.\n \n\n \nHowever, with prices at $0.00001446, the value of BONK is down 57% since the ATH of $0.00003416 per unit on Dec. 15, 2023. Despite the loss, BONK is still the third largest meme coin asset by market capitalization under DOGE and SHIB, and its overall valuation today is $887 million. BONK’s market cap is above the fourth largest meme coin CORGIAI’s $633 million valuation.\n \nThere are 56.02 trillion BONK in circulation as of Dec. 30, 2023, and 566,773 addresses hold BONK. The top ten wallets command 33.72% of the circulating supply and the top 20 holders command 40.49% of all the BONK. The top 100 BONK holders command 55.08% while the top address holds 11.68%.\n \n \nThe future trajectory of bonk (BONK) remains uncertain as the market’s whims could either further its decline or foster a resurgence. Amidst its current volatility, other meme coins are vying for the spotlight, each aspiring to replicate BONK’s earlier success.
