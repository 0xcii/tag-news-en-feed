He said if the crypto were to burn 1 million tokens per day, then it would take about 1,157,174 years to reduce its entire supply to 100 billion tokens.\n \nMeanwhile, $XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan commented on Jeff’s tweet by saying that “so, you’re saying it’s possible.” In other words, his comment appears to mean that it would be impossible and unrealistic for the crypto to take those years to burn its tokens to about 100 billion tokens.\n \nBurning Will Be A Continuous Endeavor But Will Depend On Management\n \nShiba Inu, the second most valuable meme token b…",

This would not be the first time that Elon Musks’ businesses have facilitated bitcoin transactions. Musk has previously accepted bitcoin for his Tesla electric vehicles, but later retracted the ability due to concerns about renewable energy. \nWhile there are no firm plans to implement this interoperability, Musk has firmly reiterated since his taking over of the social media firm that he wants to see it become more of a generalized “super app.” This multifunctionality approach would benefit greatly from the increased functionality of cheap, instantaneous payments using a platform like the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\nTwitter previously tested “tipping” through the Bitcoin Lightning Network via Jack Mallers’ Strike, later adding the ability for users to add a Bitcoin address to directly receive their tips.",

The Binance Card is currently already available in many European countries. \nThe Brazilian version will \"allow all new and existing Binance users in Brazil with a valid national ID to make purchases and pay bills with cryptocurrencies.\" It will charge a 0.9% fee per transaction involving bitcoin, according to the blog, and there will be an offered 8% in cashback on select purchases, while allowing ATM withdrawals without fees.\nBrazil is one of the company’s top 10 markets, according to Binance, and the card will allow new and existing users in the country to pay bills and shop with cryptocurrencies at Mastercard merchants. The launch of the prepaid card is part of Binance's effort to \"broaden the connection between traditional finance and crypto.\" The card has already been launched in Argentina and is being rolled out in Brazil next. \nBrazil is one of the largest potential markets in the world, simply by the numbers alone.

          "description": "Polygon retreated from a multi-month high to start the week, as traders moved in to secure recent gains. Chainlink also moved lower, as prices were unable to break out of a key resistance level. Market sentiment in cryptocurrencies shifted today, with the global market cap trading 2.11% lower as of writing.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) was one of Monday’s most notable movers, with prices retreating from recent gains.\n \nMATIC/USD slipped to an intraday bottom of $1.11 to start the week, less than 24 hours after rising to a high at $1.19 on Sunday.\n \nSunday’s move pushed polygon to its strongest point since November 8, as prices neared a ceiling of $1.20.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the decline in MATIC commenced following a failed breakout of a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 62.98, after failing to move beyond a resistance level of 73.00\n \nPrice strength now seems to be looking for a floor, with a target of 60.00 a possible destination for sellers.\n \n\n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nChainlink (LINK) was also lower to start the week, as the token was unable to move beyond a key price ceiling over the weekend.\n \nFollowing a high of $7.45 on Sunday, LINK/USD declined to a low of $6.98 earlier in the day.\n \nLike with polygon, today’s decline in chainlink came after a failed breakout of the resistance level at $7.50.\n \n \nAs of writing, LINK is back above $7.00, as earlier declines have somewhat eased. This comes as the RSI moves closer to a point of support.\n \nThe index is currently tracking at 56.06, with a floor of 55.00 the next visible target for bears.\n \nBulls are likely still present, however, and could look to make a move above $7.50 in the coming days.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould we see polygon move above $7.50 in the next few days? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.",
