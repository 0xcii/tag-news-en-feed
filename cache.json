          "description": "What’s the main reason behind cryptocurrencies’ success? One word – decentralization. Bitcoin offers what global banks can’t. Every major bank you know or are a client of is centralized and, thus, controlled by a central authority. This means you can freely own and control your funds, but your bank account is reliant on banking intermediaries. \n \nWith Bitcoin, this isn’t the case. Without intermediaries and by utilizing blockchain technology, transaction fees are reduced significantly, and you can transfer your funds without geographic restrictions. However, it doesn’t mean you can buy Bitcoin anonymously without effort. You still have to provide personal details due to financial regulations, even in the crypto world. Not to mention the fact you can connect a person’s identity with their B…",
