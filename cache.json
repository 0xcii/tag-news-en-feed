Trump also made several other promises, including getting Russia’s President Vladimir Putin to make a deal with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “very quickly.”\n \nDonald Trump’s Warnings\n \nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump made several promises and predictions during an interview with Fox News Sunday. He was asked about his plan to get the U.S. economy growing again and whether he thinks the U.S. is going into a recession. “If people think Trump is going to be elected, you’ll never have a recession … because people will start investing,” the former president claimed, adding:\n \n\nIf people think I’m not, you’ll have more than a recession. You’re going to have a depression.\n \n“But, what I would do is very simple. I’ve got to get interest rates down. We have to get rid of inflation because inflation is a country killer,” he stressed, noting that the Biden administration is “putting the interest rates at a point nobody can borrow.”\n \n \nTrump also made a number of other promises. For example, he said: “We’ll close up the border. We’ll become energy independent, then we’re going to be energy dominant. We’ll be taking care of Europe. Energy prices are going to come down. I will get [Russian President] Putin to make a deal with [Ukrainian President] Zelenskyy very quickly. We’re going to have a great world again.” Moreover, Trump opined: “If we don’t win in ’24, this country is finished. I really believe that.”\n \nIn April, the former president warned that the U.S. dollar is crashing and soon will “no longer be the world standard.” In addition, he cautioned that “we are very close” to a third world war.\n \nWhat do you think about the warnings by former U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the U.S. economy and the dollar?
