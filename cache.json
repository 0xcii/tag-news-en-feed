The purchase expands Ripple’s regulatory licenses and infrastructure to bolster its position in enterprise blockchain solutions.\n \nRipple Acquires Fortress Trust\n \nThe acquisition provides Ripple with Fortress Trust’s financial, regulatory, and technological infrastructure to serve the growing enterprise cryptocurrency market. “We’re excited to bring on this team and its technology to accelerate our business,” said Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO.\n \nWith the purchase, Ripple gains Fortress Trust’s Nevada trust license, adding to Ripple’s existing licenses and approvals. Fortress was launched in 2021 by Scott Purcell, former CEO of the now-defunct crypto custodian Prime Trust.\n \nThree years after Purcell’s departure, Prime Trust entered receivership when a proposed acquisition fell through. The company was then shut down by regulators and filed for bankruptcy after losing control of significant customer funds.\n \n \nKnown primarily for cross-border payments, Ripple has expanded into areas like liquidity and tokenization. The company says the purchase will improve experiences for existing products and allow exploration of new offerings. The deal is pending due diligence and approvals.\n \nWhat do you think about Ripple purchasing Fortress? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.",

This ruling, made in November 2022, concurred with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stating that LBRY presented its digital assets as securities or investment contracts.\n \nUnregistered Crypto Securities Saga: LBRY Challenges SEC Amid Wider Crypto Scrutiny\n \nThe LBRY project has lodged its intention to contest U.S. district judge Paul Barbadoro’s ruling, which determined LBRY peddled unregistered securities. On November 7, 2022, the court greenlit the SEC’s summary judgment request, deeming LBRY, Inc. in breach of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.\n \nAfter the verdict, LBRY faced a fine of $111,614 and was “permanently restrained” from any security offerings based in the United States. The blockchain project stood as the first crypto venture to square off with the SEC in such a case.\n \nSubsequently, the U.S. securities watchdog has launched a plethora of enforcement actions, tagging numerous crypto assets as “unregistered securities.”\n \n \nCurrently, these alleged crypto securities boast a combined valuation surpassing $78 billion. Amid the extensive list spotlighted by the SEC, LBRY is the 36th largest by market capitalization.\n \nTimothy McLaughlin from the law firm Shaheen & Gordon submitted LBRY’s intention to appeal. On the social media network X (previously known as Twitter), LBRY announced it had “filed a Notice of Appeal against the SEC.”\n \nWhat do you think about LBRY appealing the New Hampshire court’s verdict?
