          "description": "On Wednesday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, announced the launch of a new non-fungible token (NFT) platform infused with artificial intelligence (AI). The AI-centric product is named Bicasso, and CZ said the beta version dropped today and was limited to 10,000 mints.\n \nCombining AI and NFTs: Binance CEO Announces Bicasso\n \nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been popular in 2023, with Openai’s platform Chatgpt, also known as GPT-3, making headlines, and artists using AI-centric art programs such as Nightcafe, DALL-E, Starry AI, Jasper, and Deep AI. On March 1, Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, CEO of the largest exchange by trade volume, Binance, announced a new platform called Bicasso that combines AI and non-fungible token (NFT) technology.\n \n“Here’s a fun new Binance AI product called Bicasso,” CZ tweeted on Wednesday. “You can turn your creative visions into NFTs with AI. Give it a try and show me what you make with it. Beta version live now, limited to 10k mints,” the Binance CEO added.\n \n \nSimilar to several AI-infused art programs, Bicasso allows users to enter descriptive prompts for the AI to leverage. Additionally, people can upload pictures of a person, animal, or landscape to mix in with the photo creations. In CZ’s Twitter thread, users shared their AI creations with the Binance CEO, while others received an error message stating that the system was busy and to try again. “The team’s on it. The AI is busy,” responded the Binance executive.\n \nSince Binance announced the new AI-focused NFT maker, a message now states that the product test is closed. Users who are interested in using Binance’s Bicasso product can now join a waitlist. “Seems like I missed it,” one user wrote to CZ two hours after the Binance CEO announced the product test.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on Binance’s Bicasso platform? Let us know in the comments section below.",
