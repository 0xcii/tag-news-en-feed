          "description": "In a new interview with Bloomberg, Steven McClurg, the CIO of Valkyrie Investments, predicts that a Bitcoin spot ETF could become a reality by Q1 2024, potentially marking a significant milestone for the crypto industry. \nFurther, he indicated there is a \"50%\" chance a Bitcoin ETF is approved in October, the earliest that such a fund could pass evaluation by the SEC.\n\nElsewhere, the discussion revolved around the ongoing efforts by several financial institutions and asset managers to launch a Bitcoin ETF in the United States. While Canada and other countries have already embraced crypto ETFs, the U.S. has been slower to approve such products, primarily due to regulatory concerns.\nMcClurg believes that the growing acceptance and understanding of cryptocurrencies among regulators and institutional investors will pave the way for a Bitcoin spot ETF in the near future. He points out that the SEC has been actively engaging with the crypto industry to establish clear guidelines for these financial products.\nThe potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF could open doors for a broader range of investors to gain exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. \nCurrently, U.S. investors can access Bitcoin through various investment trusts and futures contracts, but a spot ETF would provide a more direct and convenient investment vehicle. \nMcClurg predicted that the market for Bitcoin could \"10x\" on the back of institutional investment from pension funds and other professional money managers.\nThe interview also touched on the broader implications of a Bitcoin spot ETF. It could potentially attract more institutional money into the market, driving liquidity. \nHowever, McClurg acknowledges that regulatory hurdles must be cleared before a Bitcoin spot ETF can become a reality. The SEC has expressed concerns about market manipulation, custody solutions, and investor protection. \nValkyrie is one of over 10 firms that have currently filed with the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF.",

The potential for a “death cross” will likely be in the mind of would-be bulls, looking for an opportune time to reenter. Ethereum continues to hover close to a floor of $1,630.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin’s consolidation continued on Wednesday, as bulls remained on the sidelines, despite the prospect of a “death cross.”\n \nThe term refers to an entangling between moving averages, in this instance the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) trendlines.\n \nDespite the potential for this to occur, BTC/USD bottomed out at $25,628.61, which is marginally lower than Tuesday’s high of $25,858.37.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nLooking at the chart, price consolidation comes as the relative strength index (RSI), flatlines close to a support of its own at 35.00.\n \nBulls have so far rejected a move below this point, however in the event that this occurs, BTC could fall below $25,000.\n \nLonger-term bitcoiners could be hoping for this, as a means of buying at an even lower rate.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) remained close to the $1,630 level during today’s session, despite attempts by bears to force a breakout below $1,600.\n \nETH/USD has climbed away from an earlier low of $1,610.14 on Wednesday, with price going on to peak at $1,635.29.\n \nSimilar to bitcoin, the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages seem set for an imminent upwards cross, however price has yet to react to the prospect.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nEthereum’s price strength now sits at a reading of 36.80, marginally above a floor of 36.00, however a ceiling of 44.00 is likely the real target for traders.\n \nShould a reversal happen in the coming days, a move to this point of resistance will be enough to send ETH past $1,700.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect some bullish momentum later in the week?
