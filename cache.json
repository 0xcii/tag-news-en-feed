          "description": "Bitcoin startup Chainway has taken a significant stride in the space with its introduction of the first Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) transaction on bitcoin. This is part of Chainway's continued efforts to implement ZK rollups on bitcoin, a move that may offer enhanced scalability and privacy features to bitcoin.\nChainway's recent demonstration serves as a proof of concept, illustrating how their future ZK rollup is intended to function when integrated with bitcoin. This integration seeks to combine the flexibility and programmability commonly associated with EVM and the robust security infrastructure inherent to bitcoin.\nDiving deeper into the mechanics, rollups work by grouping transactions occurring off-chain, batching them, and then publishing this consolidated batch onto the bitcoin …",

The S300 builds on the design and functionality of Digital Shovel’s previous products, improving on many aspects of the installation and operation of a portable mining container. \nThe S300 has minimized the materials required for the pod, leading to a claimed 60% reduction in shipping costs from Digital Shovel to the deployment site. The container can be set up and installed on-site from a flat shipping pack within four hours, requiring only two people and no heavy lifting equipment necessary. \n“As a pioneer of the modular approach to cryptocurrency mining data centers, we constantly strive to expand, improve and…",

During this period, the network added 22,502 ether, valued at $35.31 million, to its total supply.\n \nEthereum’s Growing Inflation Fueled by Onchain Downturn\n \nPreviously, Ethereum maintained a deflationary stance, primarily due to the London hard fork’s EIP-1559 and the notable shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Yet, the past few months saw a marked decline in onchain activities.\n \nConsequently, the EIP-1559’s fee-burning mechanism has been torching fewer ethers. Just 17 days back, Ethereum’s issuance rate was slightly inflationary, standing at 0.270% annually. But as of now, it hovers around 0.448%, marking a rise of 0.178%.\n \n \nFast forward to September 24…",
