Congressman Davidson wrote on social media platform X Thursday:\n \n\n2024 would be a great time to fire Gary Gensler, pass the SEC Stabilization Act, hold the SEC accountable for its corruption, and end the accredited investor rule that protects deal flow for the donor class.\n \nDavidson introduced the SEC Stabilization Act earlier in June to fire Gensler as the chair of the securities regulator. He previously explained that the bill would “remove the role of chairman,” noting: “It would preserve the current commissioners but it would add a sixth commissioner so there would be no more than three from any one political party.”\n \nCongressman Emmer has also repeatedly criticized Gensler for his enforcement-centric approach to regulating the crypto industry. He wrote on X Thursday: “Gensler’s SEC sides with Wall Street, not Main Street. I’m proud to join Warren Davidson as a co-lead on his bill, the SEC Stabilization Act, so we can fire Gary Gensler.”\n \nDavidson is also against the Federal Reserve launching a digital dollar. In an X post on Tuesday, the lawmaker called for the ban of central bank digital currencies. He opined:\n \n\nCentral bank digital currency (CBDC) poses an existential threat to western civilization. Sound money serves as a stable store of value and an efficient means of exchange. CBDC consummates the corruption of money into a dystopian tool for coercion & control. Ban them.\n \nDo you think SEC Chair Gary Gensler should be fired? Let us know in the comments section below.",
