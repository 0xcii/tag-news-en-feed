A Texas Senate committee recently hosted a hearing in regards to legislation that would limit energy agreements used by Bitcoin miners, along with stopping favorable tax legislation. This legislation passed through the Senate committee, bringing it one step closer to reality.\nUS Bitcoin Corp, a Bitcoin mining company operating in Niagara Falls, also recently reached a tentative agreement with the city to resume operations after the facility was halted by a state supreme court judge’s ruling. \nAlong with fines and legal fees, the miner would be forced to comply with noise ordinances and other regulations designed to limit the facility’s impact on its surrounding community.",

          "description": "A new report by the United States Treasury Department highlights the growing concern of the US regulatory agencies regarding “illicit” actors exploiting decentralized finance (DeFi) services and their associated vulnerabilities. \n \nThe report defines DeFi as virtual assets protocols and services that allow for automated peer-to-peer transactions using smart contracts based on blockchain technology. However, it notes that the term is often used “loosely” in the industry and often refers to services that are not “truly decentralized.” \n \n \nDeFi Services Under The US Treasury’s Lens\n \nMany DeFi services have a controlling organization or governance that provides a measure of centralized administration.

According to the release, the platform has already served over 500 creators and raised over $150 million on their behalf.\nZhuoxun Yin, COO, and co-founder of Magic Eden commented on the announcement, \"We're excited to expand our creator capabilities to Bitcoin and offer easy ways for creators to get started and launch... With Ordinals, content can be preserved forever, and we're proud to be helping creators and the Ordinals community grow together.\" \nMagic Eden's move to provide creators with a Launchpad for Bitcoin inscriptions comes at a time when Bitcoin inscriptions have seen a significant uptick in popularity throughout Q1 2023, as the press release describes. \nThe Ordinals protocol allows users to insert arbitrary data onto specific UTXOs, effectively enabling immutable NFTs built directly into the Bitcoin blockchain. Since the launch of the protocol, its impacts have been debated. That being said, almost 1,000,000 pieces of data have been inscribed onto the blockchain already as of the time of writing, and there are no signs of that stopping.",
