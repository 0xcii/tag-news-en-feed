People might not be able to see your face, but they can see that you are the only one wearing a mask. If you travel around the same areas frequently, people might not know your face and name, but they can consistently recognize you in the same way people do a familiar face simply by noticing the only person who wears a mask is back again. \nSo does this really constitute privacy?

Gold and silver have been accepted as commodity money for centuries because of their scarcity and desirability.\nCommodity money has some inherent limitations, such as the challenge of transportation and storage of larger quantities. This physical challenge is one of the primary reasons why it was replaced by more flexible solutions like representative and fiat money.\nCommodity money is in contrast to representative money and fiat money. Representative money has no intrinsic value but represents something of value — such as gold or silver — for which it can be exchanged.

In relation to money, it traditionally refers to the practice of reducing the precious metal content in coins while keeping their nominal value the same, thereby diluting the coin’s intrinsic worth. In a modern context, debasement has evolved to mean the reduction in the value or purchasing power of a currency — such as when central banks increase the supply of money, thereby lowering the nominal value of each unit.\nUnderstanding Debasement\nBefore paper money, currency consisted of coins made of precious metals like gold and silver.

Price fell by as much as 4% earlier in the day, as price approached a breakout below the $2.00 mark. On the other hand, solana continued to trade around the $33.00 mark.\n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin dropped for a second straight day on Friday, as bears pushed the cryptocurrency close to a breakout below the $2.00 level.\n \nFollowing a high of $2.17 during yesterday’s session, TON/USD slipped to an intraday low of $2.07 earlier today.\n \nAs a result of the decline, toncoin continued to track a one-week low, and close to a key price floor of $2.00.\n \n \nOne reason TON remains above the aforementioned level is as a result of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is above its own floor at 50.00.\n \nIn the event that this point is broken, there is a strong possibility that bearish sentiment will significantly increase.\n \nIf so, traders will possibly be targeting a lower support point of $1.90.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) made slight gains earlier in the day, as the token hovered close to a one-year low above $33.00.\n \nSOL/USD rose to a peak of $33.30 during today’s session, after falling to a low at $30.80 on Thursday.\n \nEarlier gains have since faded, with the world’s seventh largest cryptocurrency now trading at $32.37.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the 14-day RSI is marginally above a floor at 74.00, with a current reading of 74.43.\n \nShould bulls sustain this level, there is a good chance that solana could make another run towards $35.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill solana reach $35.00 during November?
