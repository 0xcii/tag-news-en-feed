After starting the month mostly in the red, prices have strongly rebounded this past week, rising by as much as 15%. Additionally, ethereum was briefly back above the $1,900 mark. \n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) bulls once again controlled market sentiment, pushing price above the $31,000 level late on Friday night.\n \nAfter an earlier low of $29,927.28, BTC/USD moved to an intraday peak at $31,389.54 as the session matured.\n \nThis saw bitcoin climb to its highest level since June 6 last year, when price traded above the $31,400 mark.\n \n \nSince reaching this peak, BTC has somewhat slipped, with the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a ceiling at 73.00.\n \nThe index now sits at a reading of 72.53, which is still deep in overbought territory, and could entice more bears to consider an entry.\n \nA recent crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages remains the main indicator highlighting the potential for more gains.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) briefly returned above the $1,900 level in the last 24 hours, however bulls here have been unable to sustain momentum.\n \nETH/USD surged to a peak of $1,932.53 last night, however entering the weekend, price has since fallen back below that point.\n \n \nCurrently, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency is trading at $1,888.03, which is marginally higher than Friday’s low at $1,865.19.\n \nA key reason for the turbulence remains the fact that price strength has been unable to move past a ceiling at 61.00.\n \nCurrently ethereum’s RSI is tracking at 59.81, however a potential upwards cross of its moving averages could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.\n \nIn the event that this occurs, chances of an ETH move above $2,000 will greatly increase.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat has been behind this week’s rally in cryptocurrency prices?

Luxury vehicles worth $2.7 million including a $600,000 Ferrari have been seized by law enforcement. \n \nFerrari Seized From Car Dealer\n \nAustralian authorities have charged two alleged masterminds of a cryptocurrency scam that defrauded $5.5 million from two unnamed companies, a report has said. One of the men, Fabio Sa Alves, was arrested on June 16 in Sydney, and a day later, 6 luxury and classic vehicles, 11 motorcycles, cryptocurrency wallets, and designer watches were confiscated.\n \nAccording to a local report, law enforcement agencies have seized luxury vehicles valued at $2.7 million, including a Ferrari worth $600,000 taken from a car dealer in Marrickville. Australian law enforcement said Alves used the crypto scam to steal from the two companies in 2021. His accomplice, an unnamed 67-year-old, is accused of authorizing the funds and hiding the Ferrari.\n \n\n \nResidents Told to Deal With Approved Exchanges Only\n \nFor his actions, Alves has been charged with three counts of “dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception” and for attempting to conceal the stolen funds. A court in Parramatta has since rejected Alves’ bail application and his next appearance is set for Aug. 24. However, Alves’ accomplice was granted bail by a court in Manly.\n \nMeanwhile, Gordon Arbinja, the Financial Crimes Squad Commander Detective Superintendent, told residents looking to invest in digital assets to work with approved crypto platforms.\n \n“When buying or selling crypto, make sure you use a digital currency exchange that is approved by AUSTRAC and always scrutinise all the details,” Arbinja reportedly said.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
