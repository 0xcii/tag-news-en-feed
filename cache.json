          "description": "On-chain data shows the stablecoin supply has surged alongside Bitcoin’s latest break above $50,000, a sign that could be bullish for the market.\n \nBoth Bitcoin And Stablecoin Market Caps Have Surged\n \nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the stablecoin market cap has recently grown. The “stablecoin market cap” here refers to the combined supply of the six largest stablecoins in the cryptocurrency sector.\n \nNote that as these stables are all tied to the USD (meaning that their value remains around the $1 mark), the market cap and supply are interchangeable in their context, as they would be equal (unlike, say, in the case of Bitcoin, where they denote different things due to a fluctuating USD value).\n \n \nThe chart below shows the stablecoin market cap trend over th…",

          "description": "The Biden Administration has intensified oversight on the U.S. bitcoin mining sector through an Energy Information Agency (EIA) emergency survey, portraying electricity usage by miners as a significant threat to national grid stability. This move, which demands detailed disclosures from miners, mirrors actions in Venezuela that led to mining confiscations, signaling a concerning trend towards a full registry of mining activities. The article advocates for the bitcoin mining community to unite against this overreach, emphasizing the positive impact miners have on grid stability through demand response programs. It critiques the EIA's legal and procedural justifications, highlighting potential legal challenges and the necessity for industry solidarity to protect mining autonomy against regul…",
