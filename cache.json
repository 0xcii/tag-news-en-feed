Since the controversy around sidechains involves advanced crypto language, let’s cover the basics first and then take a deeper look into the pros and cons of the proposal as well as any potential solutions. \nBefore we delve into the specifics of BIP-300, it's worth mentioning that there are alternative approaches to expanding Bitcoin's utility that don't involve sidechains. One such approach is merged mining, which allows Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) to be shared with more chains at no extra cost.

          "description": "BTC Inc., through its Ordinals-focused division Rare BTC, has brokered the sale of inscription number 76 for 1.7 BTC, which is equivalent to approximately $61,000 at the time of sale.\nThe sale is indicative of the active interest and perceived value in the Ordinals space, with Rare BTC positioning itself as a key player in the market for these distinctive bitcoin-based digital artifacts and unique satoshis.\nThe bitcoin ecosystem saw Ordinals generate a craze earlier this year, between May and June, with trading volume nearing that seen on Ethereum NFTs and leading to a spike in bitcoin fees. After a somewhat dull summer, Ordinals activity is back and already nearing the highs seen in May. Notably, yesterday public Ordinals trading volume in the preceding 24 hours surpassed Ethereum NFT’s for the first time.\n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \nRare BTC specializes in the sale of rare satoshis and Sub-100 Ordinals, considered to be highly sought after in the digital collectibles space. This recent transaction follows a previous successful brokerage by Rare BTC, where inscription number 20 was sold for 3 BTC.\nThe company’s role in the Ordinals market includes connecting collectors, artists, and independent brokers to facilitate transactions. BTC Inc.'s established network within the Bitcoin community and its reputation for reliability play a crucial part in completing these sales, particularly as it offers escrow services to ensure secure exchanges between buyers and sellers.\nThose interested in acquiring or selling prime Ordinal inscriptions, or seeking brokerage partnerships, can reach out to Rare BTC through their email at rare@b.tc or DM on Twitter (X). Further information about their services and offerings can be accessed on their website.\nBitcoin Magazine was a pioneer in the Ordinals space, having inscribed its own historic print magazine covers into the bitcoin blockchain among the first 100,000 inscriptions. The oldest cover, Historic Cover #1, sold for 1.25 BTC at auction.",

Bitcoin is almost 15 years old as a live network at this point, and it has stood up to a good bit of pressure and outright malicious griefing and attacks over those 15 years. Bitcoin has withstood internal attacks from developers trying to radically alter the system, it has withstood the same attack from most of the major businesses in the space, it has survived what could have been fatal and catastrophic bugs, super powers banning it, wild price volatility, etc. It has stood up to everything to date that has been thrown at it.
