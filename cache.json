          "description": "The SEC has just delayed BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree, Invesco & Galaxy, VanEck, Bitwise, and Valkyrie's spot Bitcoin ETF applications, as first reported by Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas.\n\n\n\nThis was the first SEC decision deadline in the listing process for these applicants since filing, with the delays pushing these applications back another 45 days. The next bulk of deadlines are being slated for the middle of October. \n \n         \n         \n         \n        \nImage Source: James Seyffart\n \n    \nEarlier this week, Grayscale won its lawsuit with the SEC, resulting in the DC Circuit court of appeals vacating the SEC's denial of Grayscale's $GBTC conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF. This means it will be sent back to the SEC, in which now the commission has 45 days to appeal and file for an en banc hearing, if they wish to do so. \nWhile this victory in court does not mean GBTC is automatically being converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, this ruling does help bring us one step closer to one being approved by the SEC. Because the U.S. court of appeals shot down the SEC's reasonings for denying Grayscale's application, stating, \"The Commission neither disputed Grayscale's evidence that the spot and future markets for bitcoin are 99.9% correlated, nor suggested that market inefficiencies or other factors would undermine the correlation...The Commission’s unexplained discounting of the obvious financial and mathematical relationship between the spot and futures markets falls short of the standard for reasoned decision making.\"\nYesterday, Bloomberg analysts Seyffart and Balchunas upped their approval odds by the SEC for a spot Bitcoin ETF to 75% by the end of this year, and to 95% by the end of 2024.\nMore information on the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF race can be found here.",

The trading platform is encouraging users to swap their BUSD as Binance gradually phases out BUSD markets.\n \nBUSD Support Ending on Binance, Users Told to Swap Tokens\n \nOn August 31, Binance disclosed BUSD support will be phased out and the exchange is asking users to convert BUSD to other stablecoins before February 2024. The blog post notes the issuer of BUSD, Paxos, has halted minting the stablecoin and Binance is offering no-fee swaps if customers convert BUSD balances into FDUSD.\n \nOn Sept. 7, Binance will suspend BUSD loans on cross margins and on Oct. 19, cross-margin and portfolio margin users will no longer be able to transfer additional BUSD as new collateral to the platform’s cross-margin wallet. “Withdrawals of Binance-Peg BUSD tokens via BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Tron, and Optimism networks will cease [on September 7],” the exchange disclosed.\n \nOther suspension announcements say support will continue “until further announcements.” Several other phase-out BUSD dates are listed for Binance’s loan and earn programs. BUSD has seen its supply gradually decline since Paxos was told by U.S. regulators it could no longer mint BUSD.\n \n \nThe stablecoin’s market valuation is just above the $3 billion range, while there’s 327 million FDUSD in circulation today. Binance’s announcement notes that while BUSD is being discontinued, the exchange assures that “BUSD will always be backed 1:1 by USD.”\n \nMeanwhile, Binance commands a majority of the TUSD supply according to Nansen analytics which shows the exchange’s TUSD stash represents more than 5% of its reserves. Binance further controls more than $17 billion worth of tether (USDT).\n \nWhat do you think about Binance ending support for BUSD?

Should liquidity requirements be satisfied, the exchange plans to introduce trading pairs for the asset in stages.\n \nCoinbase Adds PYUSD Stablecoin\n \nCoinbase, the prominent cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in San Francisco, has incorporated Paypal’s dollar-tied token, PYUSD, into its offerings. The firm broke the news on Wednesday, mentioning that trading would commence at 9 a.m. PT on Thursday, provided “liquidity conditions were met.”\n \n“Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our PYUSD-USD trading pairs will launch in phases,” elaborated Coinbase. “Support for PYUSD may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions.” The exchange also emphasized that PYUSD operates as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network, cautioning users against transferring the asset through alternate networks to avoid potential losses.\n \n\n \nAccording to a recent Bitcoin.com News report, PYUSD’s supply experienced a spike leaping from 26.9 million to 43.3 million PYUSD. However, despite the recent addition to Coinbase, PYUSD’s activity remains limited, recording merely 1,587 transfers and boasting 388 holders. As of 12:30 p.m. ET on August 31, the exchange’s web portal says PYUSD can be acquired via Coinbase.\n \n \nOur report on PYUSD highlighted that other digital currency platforms, such as Crypto.com, Uniswap, Gate.io, Bitmart, and Bybit, also support the token. On Thursday specifically, a labeled Coinbase wallet possesses around 1,005,467 PYUSD, ranking it as the fifth-largest PYUSD wallet as of August 31.
