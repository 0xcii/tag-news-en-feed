According to a local news report, the government has met the conditions for the men’s extradition set by the Tallinn Circuit Court. \n \nThe Estonian Ministry of Justice Has Collected Sufficient Evidence as Demanded by the Court\n \nThe Estonian government has approved the extradition of two founders of the crypto mining platform Hashflare, who are accused of operating a Ponzi scheme that fleeced $575 million from unsuspecting investors.\n \nIvan Turogin and Sergei Potapenko were arrested in Estonia’s capital Tallinn in November 2022, in a joint operation by the Estonian police and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). They face 18 counts of fraud and money laundering charges.\n \nAccording to a Post Timees report, Tallinn Circuit Court initially blocked the attempt to extradite the duo because the Estonian government had failed to probe the conditions of the place where Turogin and Potapenko were to be held, among other things. However, the Estonian government through the Ministry of Justice has said it has gathered enough evidence as per the court ruling.\n \n \nThe Estonian government now believes it has satisfied the conditions set by the court, and the men’s extradition to the U.S. would be above board. Described as one of Estonia’s high-profile fraud cases, Turogin and Potapenko’s Ponzi scheme reportedly took money from hundreds of thousands of Estonian and non-Estonian investors who were promised high returns on their investments.\n \nAfter their arrest, a U.S. attorney suggested that Turogin and Potapenko had used the allure of cryptocurrency mining to dupe people into investing.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

          "description": "Worldcoin will change the design of the Orb, the device used for scanning the irises of users as proof of personhood for the project, to be more friendly and less polarizing. Alex Blania, CEO and co-founder of Tools For Humanity, the company behind Worldcoin, stated that the next iteration would be akin to an “Apple product.”\n \nWorldcoin Redesigns the Orb to Be “Much More Friendly”\n \nWorldcoin, the biometric ID and wallet project, is making changes to the Orb, a device used to scan the irises of users wishing to prove their personhood, to make it less polarizing. Alex Blania, CEO of Tools for Humanity, explained that the current design of the Orb was agreed upon before he arrived at the company almost four years ago.\n \nBlania hopes to tone down the device with a programmed upgrade, making it more appealing and adding personalization options. In a chat, Blania told Techcrunch more about this redesign. He explained:\n \n\nThe new Orb is coming and the next iterations will look quite different.\n \nFurthermore, Blania clarified that this new version of the Orb will be more friendly and appealing, similar to an Apple product. He also acknowledged that the current design was polarizing, with some people loving it and some hating it due to its sci-fi-like appearance.\n \nWhile there was no announcement of the precise date of the reveal of this upgraded Orb, Blania stated that it would be launched in the first half of 2024 and that it had already been field-tested.\n \nThe Wordcoin project, launched officially in June, already has more than 3 million unique users in 120 countries, registering more than 190,000 signups just in the last week. In July, Sam Altman, co-founder of the Worldcoin project, declared that the project was accelerating, reporting that there was one signup every eight seconds.\n \nWhat do you think about the Worldcoin project and the current design of the Orb?
