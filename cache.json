          "description": "According to insiders who reached out to Bloomberg, there are intriguing developments surrounding Ryan Salame, the former co-chief executive of FTX Digital Markets. The buzz is that he is gearing up to admit guilt in response to criminal charges. This marks a significant shift from his earlier stance, which was revealed in mid-August when he appeared poised to invoke the Fifth Amendment, thereby rendering himself unavailable as a potential witness.\n \nRyan Salame’s Dramatic Turn: From Invoking the Fifth to Pondering Guilty Plea\n \nThe current narrative presents a contrasting perspective, hinting at the potential formation of a plea agreement concerning Ryan Salame, the former co-chief of FTX. Citing “people familiar with the case,” Bloomberg reports that Salame is poised to enter a guilty plea in connection with the FTX collapse.\n \nBloomberg’s Ava Benny-Morrison delivered this report on September 7, 2023, diverging from the accounts of the previous month. During that period, court documents from the prosecution’s case against ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) had indicated that Salame had expressed his intention to invoke the Fifth Amendment if subpoenaed, rendering him “unavailable as a witness.”\n \n \nShould Salame indeed plead guilty, he will become the fourth individual to do so, joining Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh. SBF, on the other hand, has pleaded not guilty to all the criminal charges against him and is presently incarcerated, awaiting trial at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The trial is scheduled for October, and SBF’s legal team is actively seeking his release from custody to prepare for the upcoming proceedings.\n \nWhat do you think about the insiders who say Salame plans to enter a guilty plea?

Will transaction fees eventually be able to fill up this void?\n \nBitcoin Transaction Fees Has Been Trending Up With Each Cycle\n \nOne of the most innovative features of the Bitcoin blockchain is that approximately every four years, the block subsidy (that miners receive for solving blocks on the network) is slashed in half.

However, self-custody comes in many forms, and the security properties of a single-seed setup are not that great.

The rally came despite crypto price consolidation, with the global market cap largely unchanged as of writing. Stellar also surged, remaining near a recent two-week high. \n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin (TON) was one of Thursday’s notable gainers, as price rallied by as much as 4% in today’s session.\n \nFollowing a low of $1.75 on Wednesday, TON/USD rose to a peak of $1.88, earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move comes days after the token reached a high of $2.05, which was the highest point it has hit since May.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the rise in price comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped at a floor of 60.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 63.35, with the next point of resistance around 66.00.\n \nIn the event it moves beyond this level, there is a good chance that price will move back towards $2.00.\n \n \nStellar (XLM)\n \nStellar (XLM) also hovered in the green, as the price remained near a resistance level of $0.1300.\n \nXLM/USD rose to a peak of $0.1243 earlier in the day, which comes following a low of $0.1178 the day prior.\n \nThe move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average approaches an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \n \nIn addition to this, the RSI is on the cusp of breaking out of a key resistance level of 50.00, which has been held for close to a month.\n \nBulls will potentially aim to penetrate this point in the coming days, taking price near a ceiling of $0.1400.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect stellar to rally further this week?
