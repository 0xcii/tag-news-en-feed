This time, a member of the XRP community has alluded to a clip by a top executive to remind the community of the token’s potential amidst concerns about its underperformance. \n \n \nXRP Presents An Opportunity To Become Incredibly Wealthy\n \nVersan Aljarrah, a prominent member of the XRP community, recently shared a clip on his X (formerly Twitter) platform.
