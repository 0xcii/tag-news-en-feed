          "description": "Monero continued to climb during Monday’s session, as the token surged to its highest point since February. The move comes as the global crypto market cap was marginally higher on the first working day of June. Cosmos also extended recent gains, hitting a one-month high in the process.\n \nMonero (XMR)\n \nMonero (XMR) was one of Monday’s notable gainer’s, as the cryptocurrency climbed to a five-month high.\n \nXMR/USD hit an intraday peak of $172.11, which comes a day after trading at a bottom of $163.37.\n \nAs a result of the rally, monero peaked at its strongest point since February 4 last year, when price reached a top at $174.95.\n \n \nOverall, XMR has now traded in the green for sixteen of the last nineteen sessions, climbing by over $40.00 in that time.\n \nEarlier gains have now eased, as bulls failed to sustain the breakout ceiling at the $172.00 level, with price now trading at $170.73.\n \nOne of the reasons for this was the relative strength index (RSI), which has hit a resistance of its own at 73.00.\n \n \nCosmos (ATOM)\n \nAnother notable gainer on Monday was cosmos (ATOM), which climbed to a four-week high to start the week.\n \nFollowing a low of $9.40 on Sunday, ATOM/USD raced to a high at $9.93 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move saw cosmos climb to its highest level since June 7, which is the last time it was above $10.00.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, this level also appears to be a resistance level, with bulls so far struggling to break this zone.\n \nThis will likely occur once price strength, which is currently tracking at 59.33, moves past a ceiling at 60.00.\n \nShould this take place, the next target for ATOM bulls could possibly be a higher ceiling at $11.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect cosmos to hit $10.00 in today’s session?
