However, in easing the team’s effort, the MakerDAO Co-founder believes they can explore the fork of existing open-source blockchain rather than building a new protocol from scratch. \n \n \nS…",

Ethereum remains in the red.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin continued to trend lower on Saturday, as the bears were once again in control of crypto market sentiment.\n \nFollowing a high of $28,148 on Tuesday, BTC/USD started the weekend falling to a low of $25,362.61.\n \nThe decline has come as a result of profit taking, and also the changing economic climate in the United States.\n \n \nConsumer spending is slowing, whilst the labor market remains tight as a result of increasing interest rates.\n \nLooking at the chart, today’s decline pushed bitcoin below a key support point of $25,600, however bulls have since reentered.\n \nAt the time of writing, BTC is now trading at $25,818.66, with a target of $26,000 likely to be present throughout the weekend.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nAfter almost falling below $1,600 on Friday, ethereum (ETH) was mostly higher to start the weekend’s session.\n \nETH/USD peaked at $1,650.71 earlier in the day, but momentum has since dropped, with the price now at $1,635.02.\n \nThe world’s second largest cryptocurrency has not been able to move back above $1,650, which has been a point of price support.\n \n \nFrom the chart it appears that ETH managed to avoid dropping under $1,600 due to the relative strength index (RSI) colliding with a floor at 36.00.\n \nAs of writing, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 37.04, with the next visible ceiling at 49.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect ethereum to move beyond $1,700 next week?

The executive further elaborated:\n \n\nThis new online cryptocurrency payment option is yet another way the DMV is providing innovative and convenient service delivery to our customers.\n \nA service fee of $1 plus 1.83% of the DMV total will be applicable to payments made with cryptocurrencies, the department noted. The DMV is currently accepting crypto transactions only through Paypal which can apply its own fees.\n \nColorado has been open towards cryptocurrency adoption. Under Governor Jared Polis, it started accepting crypto as payment of state taxes and fees in the summer of 2020.
