          "description": "Solana rose by as much as 8% to start the week, as the token moved toward a one-month high. The token climbed for a second straight session, as the global banking crisis pushed investors towards cryptocurrencies. Chainlink was also higher, hitting a three-week high.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) moved closer to a one-month high to start the week, as prices surged by as much as 10% in today’s session.\n \nFollowing a low of $21.59 on Sunday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday peak of $23.83 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of Monday’s move, solana has now moved to its strongest point since late-February.\n \n \nOverall, the token is now trading nearly 10% higher from the same point last week, when price was below $20.00.\n \nToday’s surge has come following a breakout of a ceiling on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 58.85, which is marginally higher than its ceiling at the 57.00 mark.\n \n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nIn addition to SOL, chainlink (LINK) was also in the green to start the week, with prices trading by as much as 3% higher.\n \nLINK/USD rose to a peak of $7.38 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a low of $6.99.\n \nThis surge has seen chainlink move to its highest level since March 2, when the token was trading at a high of $7.57.\n \n \nLike with solana, a catalyst for the move was a breakout which took place on the RSI indicator.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 57.00, which is marginally higher than the aforementioned resistance at 55.00\n \nShould this upward momentum continue in the coming days, LINK will likely collide with a ceiling at $7.60.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you believe that chainlink will hit $7.60 this week?

Over the past weeks, BTC has surged nearly 40% despite the condition of the financial sector. \n \nAccording to a recent report from economists using the now-bankrupted Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) analysis, more than 186 banks are prone to collapse following the fall of SVB. Per the report, Silicon Valley Bank had a higher capitalization of more than 10% of existing banks.\n \nHowever, the analysts discovered that 10% of US banks currently have more unrecognized losses than the SVB which means the banking crisis is only expected to intensify over the coming months. Even so, Bitcoin’s continuous rally has proved to be inevitable amid this crisis.\n \nWhy Bi…",
