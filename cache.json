          "description": "<p>Stablecoin Interoperability: Challenges and Solutions</p><p>Stablecoins, a form of digital currency pegged to a stable asset such as the U.S. dollar, have the potential to revolutionize the financial ecosystem. As major banks and financial institutions begin to launch their stablecoins or tokenized deposit systems, the future of stablecoins is closely tied to interoperability.</p><p>However, due to the market's competitive nature, there is unlikely to be interoperability between these different stablecoins. This lack of interoperability also extends to DeFi and bank-issued stablecoins, as banks aim to advance the tokenization of their products.
