          "description": "Bitcoin’s mining difficulty hit a record high after increasing 5.48% to 57.12 trillion. This rise signifies the need for a significant amount of computational power to discover blocks. Meanwhile, the network’s hashrate also reached a record high this past week.\n \nBitcoin Difficulty Jumps to 57 Trillion, Hashrate Spikes to Fresh New Highs\n \nOn September 19, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain recorded a 5.48% difficulty increase at block 808,416. This change followed the prior difficulty adjustment, which saw a 2.65% drop at block 806,400 on September 5. With the difficulty set at 57.12 trillion, it represents the toughest period ever for bitcoin mining.\n \nThe subsequent difficulty adjustment is anticipated on October 2, 2023. Since the surge to 57 trillion, the hashrate remains elevated, with current block times averaging nine minutes and 33 seconds.\n \n \nOver the last month, the hashrate’s 30-day simple moving average (SMA) stood at 402 exahash per second (EH/s). The seven-day SMA reports 432 EH/s, while the three-day SMA shows a peak of 461 EH/s.\n \n \nThe network also set a 24-hour record with a swift ascent to 538.88 EH/s at block 807,830 on September 15. Currently, the hashrate hovers around 425.16 EH/s, with about 42 entities contributing SHA256 hashrate to the network.\n \nThe Foundry USA mining pool leads with 123.92 EH/s, accounting for 29.19% of the hashrate over the last three days. Antpool provides 95.25 EH/s or 22.44% of the total hashrate, while F2pool contributes 57.33 EH/s or 13.51% as of Tuesday.\n \nWhat do you think about the latest activity in the bitcoin mining industry?

          "description": "There may be over 10 financial giants filing to launch a Bitcoin ETF, but according to one analyst, BlackRock's application may be the one to watch.\nIn a CNBC video released Monday, Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman called BlackRock's filing \"much more important\" than the other prospective offerings. To date, other applicants include Fidelity, Digital Currency Group, and most recently Franklin Templeton, which joined the race just last week.\n\"If Blackrock has an ETF, you know that they are going to win. They have the marketing and distribution to put new people into Bitcoin,\" Dorman said.\nAccording to the CNBC, BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset management firms, has been closely monitoring the cryptocurrency market for some time, even quietly exploring ways to incorporate Bitcoin into its investment strategies. \nThis prospective move by BlackRock could signal a major vote of confidence in the cryptocurrency and might encourage other institutional investors to follow suit.\nElsewhere in the video, experts shed light on how a spot Bitcoin ETF could provide traditional investors with a regulated and accessible gateway into the cryptocurrency market. Experts believe that once the SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF, it will likely attract a broad spectrum of investors, from retail traders to institutional players, who have been waiting for a regulated vehicle to enter the crypto space.\nAlready, Bitcoin Futures ETFs are publicly traded, though these funds notably do not buy or sell Bitcoin on the open market.\nFinally, the experts noted Bitcoin's broader narrative as a decentralized digital currency and store of value, as well as how the upcoming halving, in which the rewards Bitcoin pays out to the miners that secure the protocol will be reduced, could put a positive pressure on its price dynamics.\nTaken together, the CNBC report was confident enough to declare a \"next bull market\" may soon be in store.",
