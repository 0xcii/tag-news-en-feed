Cryptocurrency largely consolidated to start the week, with the global market cap down 0.64% as of writing. Shiba inu was another coin to move lower today.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) was in the red to start the week, as traders seemingly secured gains following a recent bull run.\n \nDOGE/USD rose to a two-week high at $0.0704 last Thursday, however it has since gone on to record consecutive declines.\n \nThe latest drop pushed the meme coin to an intraday low of $0.06557, which is its weakest point since Saturday.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, today’s sell-off comes as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a support point at 50.70.\n \nSince the decline, the index is now tracking at 48.55, with the next visible floor being at the 46.00 mark.\n \nIn the event that this level gets breached, there is a strong chance that DOGE will drop below $0.0640.\n \n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nAnother meme coin to fall lower on Monday was shiba inu (SHIB), which slipped following its own recent rally.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.000007907 on Sunday, SHIB/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.000007684 in today’s session.\n \nLike with dogecoin, shiba inu also captured a multi-week high last week, however, sentiment shifted after the RSI hit a hurdle.\n \n \nPrice strength failed to break out of a resistance level of 54.00, and as of writing is currently tracking at 50.43.\n \nDespite this bearish signal, a potential upwards crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages is on the cusp of occurring.\n \nShould this take place, it is likely that SHIB gains further in the upcoming week.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhere will shiba inu end the month?
