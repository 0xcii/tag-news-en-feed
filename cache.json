This development was first brought to light by Crypto Eri, a prominent member of the XRP community, in a post on X from Monday, citing updates from Crunchbase.\n \nWhy Are Ripple And Tranglo Parting Ways?\n \nCrunchbase’s latest records indicate that Ripple has exited investments in both the Bitstamp exchange and Tranglo. While the firm’s exit from Bitstamp appears aligned with Bitstamp’s acquisition by Robinhood, the divestment from Tranglo comes unexpectedly.\n \nTranglo has been an integral part of Ripple’s strategy to enhance global financial transactions using XRP.
