Particularly, the price of XRP was recently rejected at $0.66 after a little surge which saw it falling back down as far as the $0.42 price level. The crypto now finds itself ranging between $0.6 and $0.4, which means it has failed to break over new price territories for the past two years. \n \nWhile some analysts see this trend as XRP still being undervalued, others are of a pessimistic outlook. Analyst Josh Olszewicz is part of the latter group of crypto analysts.
