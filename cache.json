          "description": "Starting on Jan. 29, advertisers of cryptocurrency coin trusts targeting the U.S. market will have to meet certain requirements before promoting these on Google. According to the internet giant, violation of this new policy will not result in the immediate suspension of advertisers’ respective accounts, the multinational technology company said. \n \nAdvertisers Must Be Certified by Google\n \nGoogle has announced that starting on Jan. 29, 2024, advertisers of cryptocurrency coin trusts targeting the U.S. market will be required to meet certain requirements. Advertisers of such trusts must apply and get a certificate issued by Google before they start promoting their offerings to the public.\n \nAccording to Google, the so-called cryptocurrency coin trusts are financial products that enable investors to trade shares in trusts holding large pools of digital currency. Google, which has not provided a comprehensive list of the requirements, reminded advertisers they still need to adhere to relevant local regulations.\n \n“As a reminder, we expect all advertisers to comply with the local laws for any area that their ads target. This policy will apply globally to all accounts that advertise these products,” Google said.\n \n \nHowever, violation of this new policy will not result in the immediate suspension of advertisers’ respective accounts. Instead, a warning will be issued seven days before the account suspension. To learn more about how to obtain the certificate as well as the restrictions on financial products, Google has asked advertisers to visit its ads policy help page on its website.\n \nOn this page, Google lists country-specific requirements that advertisers for crypto-related products must satisfy before promoting their products. Google’s issues with crypto advertising date back to 2018, when the company first introduced formal restrictions.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

Those sentences have been repeated all over by several outlets, content creators, or social media accounts focused on the Bitcoin space, all encouraging that Argentina’s new president will enact policies that favor the growth of the ecosystem in what has for long been one of the leading nations in terms of adoption in the region. But why?\nOn July 26, 2016, Milei made his first appearance on the Argentine late night show Animales Sueltos, hosted by his now friend, journalist and TV presenter Alejandro Fantino. There, Milei’s appearance, combined with his shaggy hair, outspoken behavior, and most importantly, his championing of libertarian ideas, quickly gained a foothold before his presence became commonplace in n…",
