The announcement discloses that Coinbase will follow rigorous risk management and compliance standards set by Bermuda regulators.\n \n \nThe move comes as other exchanges face increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States by regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase said its futures contracts have already seen over $5.5 billion in notional trading volume since launching earlier this year.\n \nThe San Francisco-based company said its futures trading services will only be available to eligible retail investors outside the U.S. after passing the company’s assessment checks.

These bridges serve as the vital connectors between various blockchain networks, enabling seamless interoperability and the transfer of assets and data across different chains. \n \nHowever, as the crypto industry continues to invest heavily in these bridges, Chainlink’s co-founder, Sergey Nazarov, has raised a red flag, asserting that most of these bridges are “absolutely not secure.”\n \nNazarov’s concerns highlight the significant implications of blockchain bridges and the urgent need for enhanced security measures within the crypto space.\n \nThe Illusion Of Decentralization: A Perilous Predicament\n \nNazarov contends that the crypto industry often falls into a pat…",

The slight rebound in price came as the global crypto market cap was marginally higher, climbing 0.25% as of writing. Dogecoin was also in the green.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) ended a four-day losing streak on Thursday, as crypto bulls returned following a slight stalemate earlier in the day.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.000007164 on Thursday, SHIB/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.000007287 during today’s session.\n \nThis came as traders continued to move price away from a recent support point around the $0.00000710 level.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it also appears that momentum is somewhat bullish, with the 10-day (red) moving average nearing a cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nIn order for this to happen, the relative strength index (RSI) will first need to rise beyond a ceiling at the 44.00 mark.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 42.14, with SHIB trading at $0.000007256.\n \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) also ended a winless run on Thursday, as the meme coin rallied following two days of declines.\n \nDOGE/USD peaked at $0.06117 earlier in the day, which comes after a low of $0.06027 the day prior.\n \nSimilar to shiba inu, the moves comes as DOGE bounced away from a recent price floor at the $0.0600 level.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it seems as though the next target will be around the $0.0625 zone, which was last hit exactly a week ago.\n \nIn order to reach this point, price strength will need to climb from a current reading at 42.52, and head closer to a ceiling of 44.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect that dogecoin will hit this level in the coming days?
