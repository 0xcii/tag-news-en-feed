And the positive news doesn’t stop before Shibarium is rumored to be scheduled to hit the market next week, February 14, Valentine’s Day.\n \nThe Shiba Inu Burn Tracker recorded a 10,129% increase in SHIB destroyed in the last 24 hours. More than 20.97 million SHIB were burned in five transactions in the last 24 hours, with 19.40 million coming from a single transaction accounting for the majority of the burn.\n \nSince the previous day’s burn rate was very low at only 205,000 SHIB in two transactions, this represents a 10,129% increase in the last 24 hours.
