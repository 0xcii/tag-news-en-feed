          "description": "Australian regulators are reportedly drafting new  \nlegislation that will require cryptocurrency exchanges to obtain financial  \nservices licenses. This will expand the current licensing requirements, which  \napply primarily to digital currency exchanges. The Australian Financial Review  \n(AFR) shared details of these upcoming changes.\nFurther Crypto Regulations Needed\nAlan Kirkland, a commissioner at the Australian Securities  \nand Investments Commission (ASIC), explained the regulator’s reasoning. He  \nstated that the Corporations Act already covers most major crypto assets, such  \nas Bitcoin. However, further regulations are needed to ensure clearer oversight  \nof the sector.\nKirkland revealed these plans during the AFR Crypto and  \nDigital Assets summit in Sydney on September 23. He also mentioned that the  \nASIC is preparing to update the Corporations Act’s Information Sheet 225. This  \nupdate will clarify how certain crypto tokens and products should be treated  \nfrom a regulatory perspective. The new legislation is expected to be issued by  \nNovember 2024.\n\n🇦🇺 Australia will require crypto firms to obtain financial licenses as ASIC plans to update guidance on crypto assets, now seen as financial products, by November.https://t.co/z78kPXIw54\n— Telo News (@Telo_Official) September 23, 2024\n“ASIC’s message is that a significant number of crypto asset  \nfirms in the Australian market are likely to need a license under the current  \nlaw,” the commissioner stated. “This is because we think many widely traded  \ncrypto assets are a financial product,” Kirkland noted.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Tareq Sikder at www.financemagnates.com.",
