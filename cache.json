Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness a $94 million outflow, although outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may decelerate. Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase's premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin's all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance. Solana's (SOL) decentralized exchange (DEX) achieves a monthly volume of $50 billion, with revenue soaring 30-fold. OKX announces support for a new Solana token standard. Despite expectations, Layer 2 activity remains sluggish post-Dencun, according to Vitalik Buterin.",

He highlighted that the crypto community desires a broader range of crypto products from BlackRock, but the company's focus remains on Bitcoin.\n\n🚨NEW: @BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets Robert Mitchnick addresses how the asset manager is thinking about other #crypto products: \n“For our clients, Bitcoin is overwhelmingly the number one priority. And then a little bit ethereum, and very little everything else.” \nHe says…\n— Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 22, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nRegarding the future of Bitcoin on Wall Street, Mitchnick expressed optimism about a convergence between traditional finance and new technological advancements, stating, “Eventually we expect there will be a convergence where the best of the old system and the new technology will become fused into a new infrastructure system in finance.”\nEarlier this year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved a batch of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), including BlackRock's application. Since then, their ETF has gone on to be one of the most successful ETF launches in history. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF $IBIT has seen net inflows for the last 49 days straight, something only 30 other ETFs have ever done, according to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\n$IBIT and $FBTC have now taken in cash for 49 straight days, something only 30 other ETFs have ever done (and none of them did it right out of gate).
