His financial services company Block is also dedicating 10% of Bitcoin-related revenue to acquiring more BTC. \nHe also praised Nostr, a decentralized social media protocol. He has been donating millions to Nostr and Bitcoin open-source projects.\n \n                         \n                         \n                        Click the image to learn more. \n                     \n                    \nDorsey is among Bitcoin's most influential advocates. The interview covered his experience with Twitter's challenges in maintaining openness, given its centralized architecture. He believes truly decentralized networks like Bitcoin and Nostr are critical for freedom.\nBy predicting a million-dollar Bitcoin, Dorsey expresses conviction in Bitcoin's role as a global, transparent financial system enabled by cryptography rather than centralized intermediaries.",
