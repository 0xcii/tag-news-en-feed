Cosmos was also in the red, with prices retreating to a key price floor.\n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) dropped to a multi-week low on Thursday, as prices collided with a key support point.\n \nADA/USD plunged to an intraday low of $0.3501 in today’s session, following a high of $0.3637 on Wednesday.\n \nAs a result of the move, cardano traded slightly above a floor at $0.3500, which is its weakest point since February 13.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, one of the catalysts for the move was a downward crossover between the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages.\n \nIn addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) also failed to climb above a ceiling at 45.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the RSI is now tracking at 41.68, and appears to be heading for a floor at 40.00.\n \n \nCosmos (ATOM)\n \nAdditionally, cosmos (ATOM) also fell back into the red, as prices retreated to a recent floor.\n \nFollowing a high of $12.91 on Wednesday, ATOM/USD dropped to a low of $12.26 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move saw the token fall below a long-term support point of $12.30, nearing a six-week low in the process.\n \n \nOverall, cosmos is down by over 10% in the last seven days, which comes as the RSI continued to fall towards a floor at 40.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 40.99, which is near its weakest point in the last two months.\n \nShould price strength hit its targeted floor, ATOM will likely be trading close to the $12.00 mark.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould cosmos fall below $12.00 this week?
