The rally comes despite cryptocurrencies mostly consolidating on Wednesday, following recent declines. XRP was another notable gainer today.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) rose for a back-to-back session on Wednesday, hitting a multi-week high in the process.\n \nMATIC/USD moved to an intraday high of $0.5937 in today’s session, which comes following a low of $0.5523 the day before.\n \nThis resulted in polygon climbing to its highest point since August 29, when the price peaked at $0.6355.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the surge saw the relative strength index (RSI) rise past a ceiling at the 62.00 zone.\n \nCurrently, the index is now at a reading of 62.76, with an upcoming resistance level at the 70.00 point.\n \nA crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages also seems to be one of the reasons for today’s rally.\n \n \nXRP\n \nXRP was another big mover on Wednesday, as the price attempted to break out of a key resistance level.\n \nAfter Tuesday’s low at $0.5075, XRP/USD rallied to an intraday high of $0.5449 during today’s session.\n \nAs a result of this surge, the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency briefly rose past a ceiling at $0.5400.\n \n \nEarlier gains have since edged lower, which comes as the RSI fell below a ceiling at the 62.00 mark.\n \nThe index has since dropped further, and is now tracking at 56.57, and seems to be heading towards a floor of 51.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill XRP plunge further as the session progresses?

The device is expected to align with this philosophy, allowing users to securely manage their Bitcoin assets independently. \nTo that end, Block's hardware wallet is anticipated to be competitively priced, ensuring that more individuals can participate in the crypto ecosystem without breaking the bank. Hardware wallets today typically retail for between $50 and $100, though prices vary depending on the make and model.\n\n\n\nWhile the initial image of the hardware wallet offers a tantalizing glimpse of what's to come, the Bitcoin community eagerly awaits further details, including its release date, pricing, and additional features. \nBlock's venture into the hardware wallet space is poised to make a significant impact, further solidifying the company's position as a key player.",

          "description": "A new study conducted by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has shed light on the true extent of Bitcoin's impact on cross-border payments, revealing that its significance may be even greater than previously believed. \nAccording to a report by Reuters, the findings challenge conventional assumptions and underscore the growing relevance of Bitcoin in the global financial landscape. \nConducted by the organization's test lab, the study sought to comprehensively examine Bitcoin's role in cross-border transactions. While public data often provides a partial view of cryptocurrency activities, this study utilized a novel approach, including the development of a new \"global Bitcoin mapping system\" that also reportedly incorporates non-public data from private companies.\nDetails about the proprietary system were not provided by the report. Notably, however, it did acknowledge that its data is likely imperfect given it remains possible to use Bitcoin anonymously and without identification.\nThe system tracked transactions, addresses, and wallet movements to paint a more complete picture of Bitcoin's cross-border payment activities, the report said.\nMoreover, the study revealed that Bitcoin was increasingly being used for remittances, providing a lifeline for individuals in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. Its borderless nature and ease of use made it an attractive option for sending funds across international boundaries. \nThe findings of this study are expected to stimulate further discussions among regulators, financial institutions, and policymakers regarding the role of cryptocurrencies in cross-border transactions. \nFounded in the 1930s, the BIS is owned by member central banks, and its primary goal is to \"foster international monetary and financial cooperation.\"\nAs such, the report demonstrates a continued interest in Bitcoin among global central banks, some who want a stronger regulatory approach to the technology.",
