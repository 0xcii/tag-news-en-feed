          "description": "Howard Lutnick, CEO of the renowned financial services company Cantor Fitzgerald, recently shared his insights on bitcoin and tether during an appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday. Lutnick drew parallels between the fervor around spot gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the anticipated trajectory of bitcoin.\n \nHoward Lutnick Projects Bitcoin Rally Post-Halving, Validates Tether’s Reserve Strength\n \nThe Cantor Fitzgerald chief Howard Lutnick has observed that bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant surge and is now maintaining a stable performance. However, Lutnick anticipates a notable upswing in bitcoin’s value with the onset of the halving event.\n \n“Bitcoin ran up and it’s gonna kind of stay steady. But when the halving comes, it’s going to start to rally again — so bitcoin I think will grow,” he asserted to Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum event in Davos.\n \n \nShifting the focus to tether (USDT), the foremost stablecoin in terms of market capitalization, currently valued at $94.8 billion and witnessing a 4.6% increase in supply over the past month, Lutnick offered insights into Cantor’s involvement with the stablecoin issuer.\n \nHe underscored that Cantor plays a significant role in managing numerous assets for Tether and expressed confidence in the company’s financial standing. Lutnick concluded:\n \n\nFrom what we’ve seen, and we did a lot of work, they have the money.\n \n \nLutnick’s remarks stand in stark contrast to the skepticism surrounding Tether’s reserves, a topic that has been a point of contention among critics. Highlighting USDT’s substantial adoption, he pointed out its pronounced presence in particular economies, notably Turkey and several Latin American nations. Despite this widespread use, Lutnick acknowledged the limited necessity for fiat-linked tokens in the United States, conceding, “It’s not an American thing.”\n \nWhat do you think about Lutnick’s statements in Davos?

          "description": "Market insights reveal that on Jan. 15, 2024, the stablecoin TUSD deviated from its usual $1 parity, dipping to $0.979 per coin the next day. By 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Tuesday, it managed to recover slightly, climbing above the $0.99 mark.\n \nTUSD Faces Unsteady Ground, Drops Under $1\n \nRecently, TUSD experienced fluctuations, slipping below its $1 benchmark on Monday. That evening, its value lingered around $0.98, amid challenges linked to the company’s real-time attestations. As of Jan. 16, 2024, TUSD’s circulating supply, as displayed on their website, stands at 1.92 billion tokens.\n \n\n \nA significant portion of TUSD’s supply is in the hands of Binance, which owns the top five ERC20 wallets. Of the total supply, only 391.99 million TUSD tokens are issued on the Ethereum blockchain, while 1.48 billion are on the Tron network. Binance’s cold wallet holds approximately 1.4 billion of these tokens.\n \nAt 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, TUSD temporarily reached $0.996 per coin. Yet, by 10:20 a.m., it fell to about $0.987. This instability has sparked considerable debate on social media, with many questioning the reasons behind TUSD’s fluctuating peg. Most of the trading activity for the coin is concentrated on Binance, with a significant portion of its volume originating from this exchange.\n \n \nIn the last 24 hours, TUSD’s global trade volume hit $425 million. Despite a hefty supply of 1.92 billion TUSD, its market valuation on Tuesday was slightly lower, at $1.89 billion. TUSD is now among several stablecoins that have dealt with parity issues, a trend that began with the Terra blockchain ecosystem’s collapse in May 2022.\n \nWhat do you think about the issues TUSD has been facing dealing with holding its $1 peg?
