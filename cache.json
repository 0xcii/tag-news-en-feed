          "description": "After the FTX hacker transferred 5,000 ethereum (ETH) valued at $8 million in purloined assets, the cybercriminal shifted an additional 25,000 ether, totaling $43.15 million. Yet, even after relocating tens of millions of dollars in ethereum, the FTX wallet drainer still holds a whopping 155,749 ETH, currently valued at slightly above $268 million.\n \nFTX Hacker Moves 30,000 Ether\n \nIn the past three days, the individual responsible for the FTX theft has shifted a total of 30,000 ETH, worth approximately $51.15 million based on current ETH values. Following two initial transfers of 2,500 ETH each, subsequent movements were 1,250 ETH, 2,500 ETH, 1,500 ETH, 4,750 ETH and two separate transfers of 7,500 ETH each.\n \nThe hacker’s holdings also include 155,749 ETH valued at $268 million, 3.97 million tether (USDT), 1.68 million DAI and 1.57 BTC, along with a variety of other crypto assets and ERC20 tokens. This news emerges as former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried prepares for his October 3 trial, marking the start of jury selection. Some speculate the FTX wallet hack was an inside job, given the timing of the fund transfers.\n \n \nIn a conversation with reporter Tiffany Fong, Bankman-Fried speculated the perpetrator might be a former employee. “I’ve narrowed it down to like eight people. I don’t know which one it was,” he shared with Fong. The breach was first detected the day FTX declared bankruptcy. Former FTX US General Counsel Ryne Miller noted the team was examining irregularities in FTX account balances. Concurrently, Nansen’s Martin Lee observed significant withdrawals from FTX accounts.\n \nWhat do you think about the FTX hacker moving $51 million in ether over the past three days?

In fact, Wikileaks had discussed accepting Bitcoin since as far back as 2010, when early efforts were made by users to introduce the journalistic agency to the payment method.\nUltimately, Wikileaks began accepting Bitcoin in 2011, a move the organization has since credited for helping break its banking blockade in the wake of its publishing of classified U.S. government information. \nThat said, a 2014 interview, unearthed by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo, shows Assange was every bit as convinced about the technolo…",

          "description": "Coinbase, one of the world's largest Bitcoin and crypto exchanges, has received approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to offer Bitcoin buying and selling services to both retail and institutional investors in the country.\nThis milestone makes official Coinbase's expansion into the Singaporean market, which has been gradually embracing Bitcoin as an investment option.\nThe approval granted by MAS enables Coinbase to provide a secure and regulated platform for Singaporean investors to access Bitcoin, and comes on the heels of its approvals in Europe last week. \nCoinbase's expansion comes at a critical juncture for the company. Since its high-profile IPO in 2021, Coinbase has faced challenges in maintaining its share price amid a volatile crypto market. The company's stock initially surged post-IPO but has since experienced fluctuations in line with the broader cryptocurrency market.\nCoinbase's expansion into Singapore aligns with its mission to make cryptocurrencies more accessible and user-friendly for individuals and institutions worldwide. The exchange's reputation for regulatory compliance and security is expected to play a pivotal role in gaining the trust of Singaporean investors.\nThe move also reflects the broader trend of crypto exchanges seeking regulatory approval and compliance as they expand their services to cater to a wider audience. This approach not only enhances investor protection but also contributes to the legitimacy of the cryptocurrency industry.\nFurther it follows the exchange's recent promised addition of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, a second-layer solution designed to improve the scalability and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions.",
