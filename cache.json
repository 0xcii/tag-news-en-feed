          "description": "Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, the founder of Binance, has recently grappled with significant legal hurdles in the U.S. His guilty plea in a notable case led a Seattle federal judge to impose movement restrictions on him.\n \nFormer Binance Boss CZ Restricted to U.S. Soil\n \nAs the pivotal figure of Binance, CZ admitted guilt for not establishing anti-money laundering measures and breaching U.S. sanctions. His plea, which included resigning as the CEO, brought considerable repercussions for both him and the crypto exchange firm.\n \nU.S. District Judge Richard Jones, on Thursday, reversed a previous ruling that would have permitted Zhao to travel back to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Pointing to Zhao’s substantial assets and weak connections to the U.S., Judge Jones highlighted the flight risk he poses. This decision came after Jones consented to the plea agreement between the U.S. authorities and CZ, amid Binance’s settlement process.\n \nJudge Jones expressed that the court wasn’t persuaded by assurances that CZ wouldn’t flee if allowed to go to the UAE, a country with which the U.S. lacks an extradition agreement. Consequently, he ordered CZ to remain within the mainland U.S. until his sentencing in February 2024. CZ could face up to 18 months in prison for these offenses.\n \n \nMany speculate that CZ might avoid jail time, akin to Arthur Hayes, the ex-CEO of Bitmex. Hayes received a sentence of six months of house arrest and two years probation for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by not instituting an anti-money laundering (AML) system at Bitmex. Although Hayes faced a potential prison sentence, his guilty plea and the settlement of fines helped him evade incarceration.\n \nWhat do you think about the latest court ruling against the former Binance boss CZ?

Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.\n \nKiyosaki wrote on social media platform X Wednesday: “Soft landing is a fantasy. Crash landing more likely. I warned of this giant crash in my book Rich Dad’s Prophecy pub 2012.” He continued:\n \n\nThis next crash may turn into a depression.\n \nThe renowned author also shared in an X post on Sunday that the Israel-Hamas war has motivated him to buy an electric vehicle. “The war is about oil,” he said. “Higher gas prices will make the poor poorer.” He proceeded to reiterate his recommendation of buying gold, silver, and bitcoin, which he believes to be the best investment for unstable times.\n \n \nThe well-known author has repeatedly expressed concerns about challenging times ahead for the U.S. economy. Last week, he similarly cautioned about a possible next Great Depression and a war, predicting “really hard times ahead” for millions of people. Kiyosaki also previously warned of the “greatest real estate crash ever,” emphasizing that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes will also crash stocks, bonds, and the U.S. dollar.\n \nWhat do you think about the warnings by Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki about the next crash turning into a depression?
