Initiating coverage on Hut 8, Benchmark issued a buy rating  \nwith a $12 price target.

This substantial bitcoin reserve not only provides the company with a  \nsubstantial liquidity cushion but also positions it to benefit from price  \nrallies in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBroker Benchmark initiated coverage of $BTC miner @Hut8Corp with a buy rating and a $12 price target.
