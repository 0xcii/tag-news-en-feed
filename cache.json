Now, the new website validates this information and offers public proof of reserves. \nLaunching this platform represents a major step towards financial transparency in government operations.By leveraging Bitcoin's innate audibility, El Salvador continues leading the way. \n \n                         \n                         \n                        Click the image to learn more. \n                     \n                    \nDespite short-term fluctuations, the country already sits on $57 million in unrealized profit due to effective dollar cost averaging.\nEl Salvador's Bitcoin treasury tracker promotes openness and confidence in its pioneering Bitcoin strategy. \nThis economic experiment and embrace of Bitcoin set an example for other nations to follow.
