He believes surpassing this resistance level in the coming weeks could trigger a domino effect, propelling Bitcoin towards the coveted six-figure mark. His reasoning draws on the concept of “market ranges,” suggesting that once the top crypto establishes a foothold above $70,000, psychological factors could propel it further into the $100,000 territory.\n \nNovogratz said:\n \n \n“If we take $73,000 in the next couple of weeks …",
