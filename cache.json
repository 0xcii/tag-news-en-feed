This latest buy comes as Metaplanet mimics MicroStrategy's high-profile corporate bitcoin accumulation strategy.\n\nJUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japanese public company Metaplanet purchases additional 23.35 #Bitcoin worth $1.6 million 🚀 pic.twitter.com/TdUcX2TQjG\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 11, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nAs of June 11, Metaplanet holds approximately 141 Bitcoin acquired for ¥1.45 billion at an average per-bitcoin price of ¥10,278,391 ($65,000). The firm adopted Bitcoin as its treasury reserve asset in April 2024 with an initial ¥1 billion purchase. It has made several buys since.\nMetaplanet's stock rose 10% following its latest million-dollar Bitcoin acquisition, the third such purchase in just 7 weeks. The company's share price has increased nearly fivefold since first announcing its Bitcoin strategy in April, validating its Bitcoin pivot.\nBy accumulating Bitcoin, Metaplanet aims to hedge against Japan's massive national debt burden and rapidly devaluing yen currency. The firm is closely following MicroStrategy's influential Bitcoin corporate treasury playbook.\nFor Japanese investors, owning Metaplanet shares provides exposure to Bitcoin's upside without incurring Japan's tax on crypto unrealized gains, which can exceed 50%. Metaplanet also enables access to Bitcoin without regulatory hurdles by trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\nThe embrace of Bitcoin by public Asia-based companies like Metaplanet further legitimizes Bitcoin as a solid treasury reserve asset. Firms across continents are now awakening to Bitcoin's promise as an inflation hedge and store of value asset in their balance sheet.",
