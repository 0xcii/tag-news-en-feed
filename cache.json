In a post in X, Ardoino celebrated the current standing of the company, with its USDT stablecoin reaching a $91.5 billion market cap on several blockchains, $4 billion in excess reserves, and a portfolio of mining, energy, and artificial intelligence (AI) investments.\nPaolo Ardoino Celebrates Tether\nPaolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, the company behind the issuance of USDT, remarked on the evolution of the company, noting the size and significance it has reached for “millions of people,” especially in emerging markets and developing countries.\nMaking an emphasis on the growth of the company and its change in recent years, Ardoino stated:\nTether evolved. We listened to our community, we learned and improved. It’s a process. Always will be. No company has the luxury to exist without challenges. But the team kept its focus. Through the fire and the flames, we carry on.\nArdoino also praised USDT reaching $95.4 billion in market cap, becoming the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, with $4 billion in excess reserves that are separated from the actual reserves backing the USDT available on the market.\nTether has not sat idle over these earnings, though, as it has slowly invested in several initiatives involving mining, energy renewables, development platforms, and artificial intelligence (AI). Ardoino mentioned Holepunch, Synonim, Northern Data, and Tether Energy, highlighting the company’s expansion into different fields to keep growing and expanding.\nThe company has also recently reinforced its compromise in the compliance area, revealing the tight integration with U.S. government agencies like the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nFinally, Ardoino revealed Tether’s plans to develop new products for 2024 and consolidate the existing ones. “They will be mind-blowing,” he concluded.\nWhat do you think about Tether’s performance in 2023?

Answering a post on X on the topic of NFTs, Musk suggested saving the jpeg (an image format) of the NFT on the blockchain, like inscriptions are currently saved on Bitcoin.\nElon Musk Indirectly Nods at Ordinal Inscriptions\nElon Musk has given indirect support to Ordinal inscriptions, a series of images and other data saved on the BTC blockchain. In an X post commenting on the issue of non-fungible token (NFT) data, and how it can be linked to content not owned by the issuers, that can be removed, Musk declared:\nYeah, at least encode the jpeg on the blockchain!\nMusk’s complaints about how standard NFTs work are not new. On the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Musk stated:\nThe funny thing is the NFT is not even on the blockchain — it’s just a URL to the JPEG.\nAs Musk explained, earlier NFT implementations featured a link to the content highlighted in the file that led to a website, something that was pointed out by critics of the NFT mania back in the day. However, Ordinal inscriptions and Stamps, two recently introduced protocols, allow users to save the desired media directly on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, securing the longevity of the file.\nThe rise of these inscriptions has raised discussions on what constitutes a “fair use” of the blockchain space, with some mining pools even opting to filter transactions containing them, considering these inscriptions “spam.”\nThe post that started the discussion featured a video and a song about NFTs that Musk also posted in 2021. Leonidas, a co-founder of Ord.io, later reported this video was inscribed on Bitcoin by an unknown user who paid $7,223 in fees to this end. The file, identified as Inscription 51,887,020, has a size of 366.57 KB.\nWhat do you think about Elon Musk’s views on NFTs? Tell us in the comments section below.",
