          "description": "XRP has now broken past the $0.6 price mark again after a week of price correction among major cryptocurrencies. The price increase, led by Bitcoin, has seen most cryptocurrencies turning green since the weekend.\n \nXRP, being one of the largest crypto assets by market cap, has been included in this increase.
