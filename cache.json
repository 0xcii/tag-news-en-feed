The trust is a Delaware statutory trust structure designed to strengthen the company’s worldwide asset management capabilities. “A registration statement relating to Grayscale Funds Trust has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective,” Grayscale stated on Tuesday.\n \nGrayscale highlighted that they had previously established Grayscale Advisors, an SEC-registered investment advisor, which will serve as the new trust’s advisor. Besides the trust, Grayscale has also filed a registration statement for three additional funds. These newly launched funds consist of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, and Grayscale Privacy ETF.\n \nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in a statement: “The creation of Grayscale Funds Trust reflects our dedication to scaling Grayscale’s business responsibly,” adding that “we are putting the necessary foundations in place so Grayscale can continue creating and managing regulated, future-forward products.”\n \n \nMoreover, Grayscale announced that David LaValle, the company’s global head of ETFs, would assist with their expansion. “It has been incredibly exciting to build our ETF franchise – hiring a dedicated team, expanding our partnerships, and enhancing our position within the ETF ecosystem,” LaValle said.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on Grayscale Investments’ latest move into the world of exchange-traded funds and the establishment of the Grayscale Funds Trust?
