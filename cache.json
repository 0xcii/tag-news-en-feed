The meme coin was a notable gainer in today’s session, despite market sentiment mostly tracking lower. Polygon was also in the green, extending recent gains in the process.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin ended a six-day losing streak on Tuesday, as prices rebounded from a recent point of support.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.06246 on Monday, DOGE/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $0.06422 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move comes as the meme coin surged from a floor at $0.0620, with bulls now likely targeting a ceiling of $0.0680.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the bounce in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose from a floor at 39.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 42.66, with the next point of resistance around 47.00.\n \nIn the event that this is broken, there is a good chance that DOGE will move back towards $0.07000.\n \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) was also trading higher in today’s session, with price climbing for a fourth straight day.\n \nMATIC/USD peaked at $0.5634 on Tuesday, which comes following a low of $0.5406 to start the week.\n \nAs a result of the move, polygon climbed to its strongest point since last Thursday, when the price reached a high of $0.5885.\n \n \nOverall, with this current uptrend, it appears that MATIC could be heading towards a key resistance point of $0.6000.\n \nIn order to get there, the RSI, which is tracking at 40.08, will first need to move past an upcoming ceiling at the 41.00 level.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill polygon continue to extend this bull run?

Koski’s objective according to the Commission was to not only boost the price of the security that used the symbol COTRP but bolster the value of his portfolio.\n \nTo support these allegations, the SEC claimed that after Koski posted a notice in May 2021 stating that the “JCP debentures would be redeemed early at their full value,” the price of the security went up by 75%. According to the SEC, Koski was aware that his statements were false.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",
