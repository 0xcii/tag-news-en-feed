          "description": "Banks would be allowed to hold 2% of capital in bitcoin, but required to have one euro in capital for every euro in cryptocurrency held.\nEuropean Union lawmakers have voted to impose strict capital requirements on banks that hold cryptocurrencies, per a Reuters article.\nIn an effort to “prevent instability in the crypto world from spilling over into the financial system,” Markus Ferber, economic spokesperson for the EU parliament's European People’s Party, says, “banks will be required to hold a euro of own capital for every euro they hold in crypto.” \nLawmakers cite the chaos in the markets seen over the last few months as further evidence that such regulation is necessary. With events like the collapse of FTX, Celsius and others fresh in the minds of users, the passing of this law is anticipated to be part of a larger set of regulations aimed at bringing the EU into line with international norms.\nThe passed regulation mirrors that suggested by the Bank for International Settlements' Basel Committee, which also suggested the highest possible risk tier weighting for holdings of “unbacked crypto.” Their recommendations placed a 2% limit on tier 1 capital that could be held denominated in unbacked cryptocurrencies. \n“There is no definition of crypto assets in the [legislation] and therefore the requirement may apply to tokenized securities, as well as the non-traditional crypto assets the interim treatment is targeted at,” the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), an EU lobby group representing finance organizations like investment banks said, indicating that the current form of the law could be unclear, but that draft issues may be fixed later on.\nWhile the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee voted to approve the measures, in order for them to go fully into effect, they must also be approved by the European Parliament as a whole, and be presented to the national finance ministers meeting in the Council of the European Union.",

          "description": "Avalanche moved to a multi-month high on Jan. 24, after reports that the number of bitcoin on its network rose to 5,493. The news saw the token surge by nearly 5% today, rising for a third straight session in the process. Polygon also moved higher on Tuesday, hitting a one-week high.\n \nAvalanche (AVAX)\n \nAvalanche (AVAX) rose to a multi-month high on Tuesday, as prices rallied for a third consecutive session against a backdrop of bullish news.\n \nFollowing a low of $17.43 to start the week, AVAX/USD moved to an intraday peak of $18.86 earlier today.\n \nAs a result of today’s surge in price, AVAX has risen to its strongest point since Nov. 6.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the move took place following a breakout of a ceiling at the $18.50 mark.\n \nIn addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) neared a resistance level of its own at 72.00\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 71.11, with earlier gains fading, resulting in AVAX currently trading at $18.22.\n \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nIn addition to AVAX, polygon (MATIC) climbed higher in today’s session, following a collision with a key price floor.\n \nMATIC/USD raced to a peak of $1.04 earlier in the day, less than a day after hitting a low of $0.9849\n \nThe move saw polygon reach its highest level since last week Monday, when price was last close to a resistance of $1.05.\n \n \nHowever, like on that occasion, prices have since plunged, with momentum not strong enough to force a breakout.\n \nAs of writing, MATIC/USD is now trading at $1.00, which is also its long-term support point.\n \nOne positive is that the RSI seems to be a fair distance away from its own floor at 61.00, and is currently tracking at 63.27, with a ceiling of 65.00 a possible target.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect polygon to move beyond $1.05 this week?
