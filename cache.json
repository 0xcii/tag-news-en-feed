Interestingly, his theory revolved around the foremost meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), which he believes could attract non-crypto natives back into the crypto space. \n \nDogecoin’s Role In Attracting Mainstream Demand For Crypto\n \nMelker mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that mainstream FOMO (fear of missing out) will return to the crypto market when the foremost meme coin hits a new all-time high (ATH).
