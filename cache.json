This decline has raised questions about the performance and future prospects of PoS assets.\n \nPoS assets are a type of cryptocurrency that operates on a different principle than Proof-of-Work (PoW) assets like Bitcoin. In PoS, the validation of transactions and creation of new blocks are not dependent on energy-intensive mining processes. Instead, validators, or “stakers,” are chosen to create new blocks and verify transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to “stake” as collateral.\n \nThis shift away from PoW to PoS a…",
