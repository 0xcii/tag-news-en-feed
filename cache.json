Many people all over the world are currently living somewhere presenting serious risks to their livelihood and well being, everything from totalitarian and persecutory governments to the general state of the economy deteriorating so badly that their ability to sustain themselves is in question. \nThis puts people in a horrific position, having to choose between continuing to tough out the situation and maintain their possessions, or leaving most of what they own behind to flee from abusive governments or a destroyed economy. If they are lucky enough to even have the financial and practical capability to leave in the first place. You can’t bring large amounts of cash or gold with you, they’ll be seize…",

          "description": "My buddy Harry Sudock has a wager with Danny Knowles of What Bitcoin Did fame about the prospect of a 50 BTC block reward in this new epoch. Putting aside a couple of fat fingers, the last time this happened was over 4000 days ago. \nLate last Friday night, his bet almost hit on the very first halving block, a 40.751 BTC stunner. \nIronically, miners were the big winners at this turn of the epoch, netting just over 100 million dollars in total revenue on the day — almost five times the previous all-time high.\n\nThe days around the halving, visualized as block fee rates.https://t.co/FP3PfGHAiB pic.twitter.com/xcS22GPw79\n— softsimon (@softsimon_) April 21, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nBeyond the numbers, this time felt different.

This unprecedented streak has propelled IBIT into the top 10 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the longest daily inflow run, putting it in league with industry heavyweights.
