          "description": "Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

          "description": "Bitcoin rebounded from Tuesday’s losses, as all focus in the market turned to today’s United States Federal Reserve rate decision. It is widely expected that the Fed will hike rates by 25 basis points in May’s meeting. Ethereum also moved higher, nearing $1,900 in the process.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) rebounded on Wednesday, as all focus in the market turned to today’s Federal Reserve rate decision .\n \nFollowing a low of $27,935.73 on Tuesday, BTC/USD surged to an intraday high of $28,881.30 earlier in the day.\n \nThis came as after bitcoin rejected a breakout below its long-term floor at $27,600 to start the week.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nOverall, momentum has shifted marginally higher, as the 10-day (red) moving average approached its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nShould this upwards crossover occur, this could be a signal that bulls need to intensify pressure, and potentially take BTC back above $30,000.\n \nIn order for this to occur, the relative strength index (RSI) will first need to surge past a ceiling at the 52.00 mark.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also bounced back on hump-day, as bulls began to reenter the market.\n \nETH/USD rose to a peak of 1,879.76 on Wednesday, after almost falling below $1,800 the day prior.\n \nThe move saw ethereum bulls briefly push price above a ceiling at $1,875, before retreating as the session matured.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nEarlier gains eased as price strength was unable to rally past a key point of resistance at 48.00, with the index now tracking at 46.99.\n \nDespite this, there is still some optimism that ethereum could move beyond $1,900 later today, once the rate decision is made.\n \nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,859.53.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nHow do you believe today’s rate decision will impact markets?
