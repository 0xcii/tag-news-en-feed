This endorsement is noteworthy as ARK Invest, a pro-crypto asset manager, is one of the largest shareholders of Coinbase Global (COIN), the leading cryptocurrency exchange in the United States.\n \nMusk said users should follow Ark Invest’s research, where they can preview Tesla’s short variances in gross margin and profitability. In his view, these variances are “minor” relative to the long-term picture and holding Tesla’s stock is a “big long-term investment”. \n \nAlthough Tesla posted all-time high quarterly revenue and stock prices briefly rose after the earnings call, prices slumped in the after-market hours and are lower as of July 22.

          "description": "Bitcoin consolidated around the $30,000 level to start the weekend, as traders attempted to find a firm price floor on Saturday. The market has been volatile during the past week, as recent winners took profits, following the XRP-related bull run. Ethereum remained below $1,900 on Saturday.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) started the weekend trading close to the $30,000 level, as markets consolidated following recent price volatility.\n \nBTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $30,046.00, which comes following an earlier low of $29,746.12.\n \nThe move sees bitcoin climb back above a recent support point of $29,800, which has held mostly firm for the past week.\n \n \nOne of the reasons for the stabilized floor is due to the relative strength index (RSI), which is hovering close to a support of its own at 49.00.\n \nCurrently, price strength is tracking at 49.77, with the next visible resistance point at the 50.00 mark.\n \nIn order for BTC to climb beyond the $30,000 mark, this ceiling on the RSI will first need to be broken.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum was also consolidating during today’s session, as the cryptocurrency remained below $1,900.\n \nFollowing a high of $1,905.39 on Friday, ETH/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,885.30 earlier in today’s session.\n \nSimilar to BTC, ethereum’s decline saw the cryptocurrency fall to a key support point of $1,880 to start the weekend.\n \n \nThis comes as price strength hovers around its own floor around the 50.00 zone, which has been in place since the start of the week.\n \nDespite this, it still appears that the 10-day (red) moving average is trending higher, however this could begin to shift in the coming days.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill markets continue to consolidate this weekend?
