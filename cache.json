Like many at the time, I imagined that Ethereum or another highly performant smart contract blockchain would grow to become the base layer of the Internet. The other outcome in my mind was a “multi-chain” future where the Internet ran on multiple smart contract L1s. And Bitcoin, being a boring chain devoid of Turing completeness, had no role in Web3.\nA few facts could have easily set the record straight if I were only aware of them at the time. Luckily, I was more cautious with my money than with my thoughts, so I never lost anything investing in Web3 ERC-20 tokens.\nToday I am actively betting against the “…",

          "description": "On Thursday, November 16, 2023, Bitcoin saw its average transaction fees peak at $18.69 per transfer, marking a high of 0.00051 BTC. This surge represented the second-largest increase in 2023. However, the following day saw a reduction in onchain fees. Despite this, as of 8:13 a.m. Eastern Time, there was a considerable backlog of approximately 239,862 unconfirmed transactions.\n \nOnchain Fees on Bitcoin Network Soar, Reaching Near-Record Heights\n \nOn the same day, data from bitinfocharts.com and ycharts.com revealed that the Bitcoin network’s average transaction fee was $18.69. The median fee also escalated to 0.00032 BTC or $11.61 per transfer.\n \n\n \nThis increase in transactional activity can be attributed to the renewed interest in Ordinal inscriptions, a trend that persists. According to November 17 statistics from mempool.space, a high-priority BTC transaction incurs a fee of $4.61, while a no-priority transaction costs about $1.64.\n \nThe mempool is currently dealing with a backlog of 239,862 pending transactions, awaiting miner confirmation. Clearing this congestion requires miners to process 288 blocks or 588 megabytes (MB) of block space.\n \n \nData from two distinct sources suggest that Bitcoin’s average block time oscillates between 9 and 10.1 minutes. Notably, the average fee on November 16 is the year’s second-highest, trailing only behind May 8, 2023, when fees averaged around $31 per transaction that day.\n \nMoreover, on November 9, 2023, the average fee rose to $15.86 per transfer, marking the third-highest spike since May’s all-time high. Bitcoin’s highest fee run-up before the May 2023 spike was a high of $62 per transfer 940 days ago on April 21, 2021.\n \nWhat do you think about Bitcoin’s network fees on the rise again?
