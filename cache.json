He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

The BRICS nations are working on creating a common currency to reduce their USD reliance.\n \nIndonesia’s De-Dollarization Efforts\n \nBank of Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo said Friday that Jakarta is following the lead of the BRICS bloc to shift away from using the U.S. dollar in trade and financial transactions, Sindonews reported Friday. The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) have been ramping up de-dollarization efforts to use local currencies in international trade and reduce their dependence on the USD. They are also working on establishing a new currency.\n \nSpeaking at a press conference following this month’s board of governors meeting, the central bank chief confirmed that Indonesia has implemented the local currency trade (LCT) system. He was quoted as saying:\n \n\nIndonesia has initiated diversification of the use of currency in the form of LCT. The direction is the same as the BRICS. In fact, Indonesia is more concrete.\n \nHe explained that Indonesia’s LCT system is considerably more concrete than the BRICS de-dollarization approach, given that Indonesia has already implemented the currency diversification method with several nations, including Thailand, Malaysia, China, and Japan. In addition, the Indonesian government plans to sign an agreement with South Korea regarding local currency transactions in early May, he noted.\n \nAs the U.S. continues to weaponize the dollar, countries are seeking alternatives, from creating new common currencies to using local currencies. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently admitted that economic sanctions used against countries by the U.S. put the dollar’s dominance at risk.\n \nWhat do you think about Indonesia following the BRICS’ direction to ramp up its de-dollarization efforts?

The global bank’s analyst has identified several factors contributing to the surge in the price of the cryptocurrency, including the recent turmoil in the banking sector.\n \nStandard Chartered Bank on Bitcoin Hitting $100K\n \n\n \nGlobal bank Standard Chartered said Monday that “crypto winter” is over and the price of bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024.\n \n\n \nStandard Chartered’s head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, explained in a note that bitcoin stands to benefit from various factors. They include the recent turmoil in the banking sector, a stabilization of risky assets as the U.S. Federal Reserve ends its cycle of interest rate hikes, and the enhanced profitability of cryptocurrency mining. The analyst wrote:\n \n\nWhile sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nA growing number of individuals and analysts have recently expressed optimism regarding the outlook for bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $27,464, down from above $30K a week prior. However, the cryptocurrency is up 65% year-to-date.\n \n\n \nIn March, the CEO of investment management firm Vaneck said that “We are at the very beginnings of what could be a several-year cycle” in gold and bitcoin while Bloomberg Intelligence’s commodity strategist stated that a supercycle may be happening in BTC. In February, Pantera Capital said that we’re already in the next bull market cycle for bitcoin. Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki expects BTC to keep rising, predicting that the price of the largest crypto will reach $500K by 2025.\n \n\n \nWhat do you think about Standard Chartered’s bitcoin prediction? Do you think the price of bitcoin will reach $100K by the end of next year? Let us know in the comments section below.",
