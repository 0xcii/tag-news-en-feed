          "description": "India has ramped up its regulatory measures against  \noffshore cryptocurrency exchanges, directing Apple to eliminate the apps of  \nplatforms such as Binance from its App Store within the country. \nAccording to a report by Bloomberg, this recent escalation follows a notice from the  \nFinancial Intelligence Unit (FIU) targeting nine platforms suspected of  \nregulatory misconduct in late December, signaling a tightening grip on the  \ncrypto landscape.\nThe Ministry of Electronics and Information  \nTechnology prompted the removal of apps from platforms  \nlike Bitfinex, HTX, and Kucoin, among others, from the Indian App Store. While  \nthese directions weren't made public, sources familiar with the matter  \ndisclosed this intervention, showcasing a firm stance against non-compliant  \noffshore exchanges.\nIntensifying Crypto Crackdown\nIndia's stance against offshore crypto platforms  \nheightened following the December 28 notification to nine exchanges suspected  \nof operating unlawfully. Fearful of potential fund access loss, Indian crypto  \ntraders had already begun shifting deposits to locally compliant exchanges  \nadhering to the nation's regulations.\n India's FIU issued compliance show cause notices to  \nthe offshore platforms on December 28, urging the information ministry to block  \ntheir URLs. Additionally, Asia's second-most populous country  \nimplemented anti-money laundering provisions within the crypto sector, adding a  \n1% levy called Tax Deducted at Source.\nThe step reportedly led to a migration of trading  \nvolumes to offshore venues. Local exchanges were affected as traders sought  \nplatforms that did not impose this tax, significantly reducing their trading  \nrevenues.\nExpect ongoing updates as this story evolves. \n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.",
