          "description": "Ethereum fell below $1,800 in today’s session, as markets continued to react to the latest U.S. consumer price index. Inflation in the United States fell to 4.9% in April, less than the 5% sum many had expected. Bitcoin was also lower on the data, falling below $27,000.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) briefly dropped below $27,000 late on Wednesday, as markets reacted to the latest U.S. inflation report.\n \nAfter an earlier high of $28,322.69, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $26,883.67 towards the close of yesterday’s session.\n \nThis move saw bitcoin drop to its weakest point since March 28, when price was at a low of $26,640.\n \n \nSince this earlier decline in price, BTC has since rebounded, and is currently trading at $27,494.24.\n \nFrom the chart, this appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI), which is now tracking at 41.91, and close to reentering a floor at 43.00.\n \nShould this occur, there is a strong possibility that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could be back above $28,000.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nAdditionally, ethereum (ETH) also fell to a multi-week low in today’s session, dropping below $1,800 in the process.\n \nETH/USD slipped to a bottom at $1,795.67 late on Wednesday, following an earlier peak of $1,886.80.\n \nAs a result of the sell-off, the cryptocurrency dropped to its lowest level since April 26, however price has since rebounded.\n \n \nOne of the catalysts for the sell-off was a breakout which took place on the RSI, which saw the index fall below 45.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 43.93, with ethereum now trading at a price of $1,824.22.\n \nIt appears that a crossover between the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages will likely occur, and could signal a reversal in momentum.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould ethereum climb above $1,900 this week?

Sweden has almost completely abolished anonymous cash transactions and, as a result, its regulators have control of all financial assets. Since at least 1971, when I moved to Sweden, bank assets have to be reported annually to the tax authorities, which can also demand documentation for all bank transactions. Since 2020, the Swedish police have the right by law to acquire access to locked iphones and computers by use of force. \nIn such a privacy-averse environment, one should consider Bitcoin as a better alternative. \nIntroducing The E-Krona\nIn the …",
