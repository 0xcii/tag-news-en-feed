          "description": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis may not have been a crypto authority, but he embraced digital assets as a political tool and ensured his influential state made moves to support the industry while he still had his eyes on the White House. His absence – and that of fellow candidate Vivek Ramaswamy – marks a sudden lack of crypto interest in this year's U.S. presidential race.",

          "description": "Following the submission of a proposal by FTX estate debtors to reimburse customer assets based on their value as of Nov. 11, 2022, numerous objections have been raised by customers.
