More specifically, these holders are carrying between 100 and 1,000 BTC in their wallets right now.\n \nAt the current cryptocurrency exchange rate, the lower bound of this range is about $6.2 million, while the upper one is about $62 million. Investors of this size are popularly known as “sharks.”\n \n \nGiven these large holdings, sharks can exert some influence in the market, although they are less significant than the whales, the largest holders (1,000+ BTC).\n \n…",
