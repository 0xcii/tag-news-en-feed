Currently the frontrunner in the US presidential race, Trump is slated to give a keynote on the conference’s final day (Saturday).\n \nThe Bitcoin community is rife with speculation that Trump might announce plans to establish a US Bitcoin strategic reserve if elected in November.

The ETF will invest in short positions on Bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This gives traders exposure to the daily inverse performance of the underlying Bitcoin futures index.\nTraders can hedge risk or speculate on downward price moves by going short on Bitcoin futures. This new tool provides an alternative to shorting or buying put options on Bitcoin directly.\nThe inverse ETF is managed by CSOP Asset Management, with HSBC as the trustee. It charges a 1.99% annual fee and aims to attract $50-100 million in assets under management in 1-2 years.\nThe launch has generated buzz as a new way to trade Bitcoin volatility. While controversial to some, inverse Bitcoin ETFs are gaining traction globally. The ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI) in the U.S. has over $70 million under management.\nThe CSOP product will be the first of its kind in Asia, bringing inverse Bitcoin exposure to Hong Kong's $5.4 trillion stock market. It represents another milestone for mainstream Bitcoin adoption in the region.",
