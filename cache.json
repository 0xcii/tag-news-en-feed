Growth in crypto assets corresponded with more banks expressing interest in crypto activities last year. However, the sector then experienced a crash that exposed vulnerabilities. The FDIC is closely monitoring crypto activities at banks and said additional guidance is likely.\n \n“Part of the difficulty in assessing these risks arises from the dynamic nature of crypto-assets, the crypto marketplace, and the rapid pace of innovation,” the report …",

          "description": "Solana was one of Tuesday’s big gainers, rising to a multi-week high following a ‘death cross’ of moving averages. The move came despite the global market cap falling marginally lower as of the time of writing. Toncoin was another notable mover, rising for a sixth-straight day.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) surged higher on Tuesday, as sentiment in the token has remained largely bullish in recent days.\n \nSOL/USD peaked at $25.24 during today’s session, which follows up from a low of $24.35 to start the week.\n \nThis climb saw solana trade at its highest point since July 29, when price reached a high of $25.39.\n \n \nThe move came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nShould upward momentum continue to intensify, the next target for traders will likely be around the $26.00 mark.\n \nAt the time of writing, SOL is trading at $24.82.\n \n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin (TON) was also in the green in today’s session, as the price climbed for a sixth-consecutive session.\n \nFollowing a low of $1.42 to start the week, TON/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1.49 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of today’s surge in price, toncoin moved to its strongest level since July 23, and closer to a ceiling of $1.50.\n \n \nSimilar to solana above, the rally came as the 10-day and 25-day moving averages neared an upwards cross.\n \nOne area of concern for bulls is the current reading of the RSI indicator, which is tracking at 66.91.\n \nThis is the highest area it has reached in the coin’s history, meaning it is greatly overbought, with bears potentially waiting to take advantage of this.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould toncoin begin to move lower in the coming days?

          "description": "During the last crypto bull market, Dogecoin was a clear leader among altcoins and beat Bitcoin by miles in terms of return on investment (ROI).\n \nCould this old dog be up to it’s same tricks? The meme coin is mere pennies away from triggering a “parabolic” signal that the last time around resulted in a 25,000% gain.\n \nWhy Dogecoin Could Become A Bull-Dog\n \nDogecoin has lost a large share of its former value alongside the rest of the crypto industry. This is common during a bear market. But during a bull market, the returns have historically been shocking.\n \n \nThe meme coin became the poster child of the last crypto bull run, famously being mentioned numerous times during Elon Musk’s Saturday Night Live performance.\n \nThat event was close to the peak of the previous cycle, and since then has been rolling over and playing dead. Soon, it could bite back. That is according to the Parabolic SAR indicator on the 1M DOGEUSD chart.\n \n\n \n \nDOGE Closes In On Parabolic Buy Trigger\n \nThe Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator created by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. who also created such tools as the Relative Strength Index, the Average Directional Index, and Average True Range.\n \nThe tool is used to tell a trader or investor that the trend has “stopped and reversed”. If DOGEUSD can tag the Parabolic SAR on the 1M timeframe, it could tell the market that the trend has officially changed.\n \n \nThe reason this is important, is because Dogecoin is typically an indication that altcoin season is approaching. When it begins to take off, so does the rest of the altcoin market. At least it has always historically done so.\n \nA buy signal has only been triggered three times in the past, causing a 500%, 225%, and 25,000% rally, respectively. Will this signal once again prove as reliable as man’s best friend?\n \nThis chart originally appeared in “Issue #16: Worst Bear Market Ever” of CoinChartist VIP. Subscribe for free.",
