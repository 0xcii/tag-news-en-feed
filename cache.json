Its largest position was in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), worth nearly $240 million.\nGoldman also held shares of the $79.5 million Fidelity Bitcoin ETF, $35.1 million in Grayscale BTC, $56.1 million in Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin, $8.3 million in Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, and smaller stakes in funds from WisdomTree, Ark Invest.\nThe disclosure highlights surging institutional demand for Bitcoin products as Bitcoin gains mainstream adoption. With its sizable and diverse Bitcoin ETF holdings, Goldman aims to benefit from Bitcoin's upside potential without direct ownership.\nEarlier this year, Goldman Sachs' head of digital assets called Bitcoin ETFs an \"astonishing success,\" signalling a pivot after years of the Wall Street giant's scepticism about Bitcoin.\nAs legacy finance gradually embraces Bitcoin, Bitcoin ETFs have become a prime gateway for institutional participation. ETFs offer familiarity and liquidity while muting Bitcoin's volatility swings.\nEventually, most major financial institutions will likely hold significant Bitcoin exposure to meet client demand. Goldman's Bitcoin ETF bet signals an understanding that Bitcoin is here to stay.",
