This latest integration reflects the company's growing efforts to bridge Bitcoin with its sprawling traditional payments infrastructure.\n\"We are providing consumers who want to spend their digital assets with an easy, reliable, and secure way to do so, anywhere Mastercard is accepted,\" said Christian Rau, Senior Vice President of Mastercard's crypto unit.\nThe card allows spending Bitcoin and other crypto simply by connecting a non-custodial wallet. Users avoid selling Bitcoin and crypto on an exchange before spending, maintaining full ownership. However, Mastercard's card does have fees, including a €1.6 issuance fee, €1 monthly maintenance fee, and a 0.95% transaction fee. \nNonetheless, by supporting non-custodial wallets, Mastercard addresses a major pain point and grants users the flexibility to directly control their Bitcoin and crypto. The move caters to a growing audience preferring self-hosted wallets over centralized exchanges.",
