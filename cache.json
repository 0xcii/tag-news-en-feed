In a modern context, debasement has evolved to mean the reduction in the value or purchasing power of a currency — such as when central banks increase the supply of money, thereby lowering the nominal value of each unit.\nUnderstanding Debasement\nBefore paper money, currency consisted of coins made of precious metals like gold and silver.

          "description": "Toncoin was a notable mover on Friday, as the cryptocurrency edged lower for a second straight session. Price fell by as much as 4% earlier in the day, as price approached a breakout below the $2.00 mark. On the other hand, solana continued to trade around the $33.00 mark.\n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin dropped for a second straight day on Friday, as bears pushed the cryptocurrency close to a breakout below the $2.00 level.\n \nFollowing a high of $2.17 during yesterday’s session, TON/USD slipped to an intraday low of $2.07 earlier today.\n \nAs a result of the decline, toncoin continued to track a one-week low, and close to a key price floor of $2.00.\n \n \nOne reason TON remains above the aforementioned level is as a result of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is above its own floor at 50.00.\n \nIn the event that this point is broken, there is a strong possibility that bearish sentiment will significantly increase.\n \nIf so, traders will possibly be targeting a lower support point of $1.90.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) made slight gains earlier in the day, as the token hovered close to a one-year low above $33.00.\n \nSOL/USD rose to a peak of $33.30 during today’s session, after falling to a low at $30.80 on Thursday.\n \nEarlier gains have since faded, with the world’s seventh largest cryptocurrency now trading at $32.37.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the 14-day RSI is marginally above a floor at 74.00, with a current reading of 74.43.\n \nShould bulls sustain this level, there is a good chance that solana could make another run towards $35.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill solana reach $35.00 during November?
