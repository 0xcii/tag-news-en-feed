The company is now seeking to raise $700 million, up from the previously announced $500 million.\n\nBREAKING: MicroStrategy increased its raise to $700 million to buy more #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/B2I2uk98Ie\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 14, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nMicroStrategy first announced plans on Thursday to raise $500 million by selling convertible senior notes to qualified institutional buyers. The proceeds would primarily go toward acquiring more Bitcoin for its corporate treasury, which already contains over 214,400 BTC worth $15 billion.\nThe software analytics firm then boosted the offering to $700 million on Friday. The company said the offering is expected to close on June 17th.\nMicroStrategy has aggressively accumulated bitcoin since 2020 under Saylor's direction. It utilizes debt to fund its Bitcoin buying, taking advantage of market volatility. The company cited its confidence that Bitcoin will continue appreciating over the long term.\nBy selling convertible senior notes, MicroStrategy gains flexibility. The notes pay interest and mature in 2032, but noteholders can convert into MicroStrategy stock before maturity.\nThis structure allows investors to benefit from potential Bitcoin price upside through the stock conversion option. It also shields note holders from downside risk due to their senior unsecured status.\nMicroStrategy said it may use proceeds not allocated to Bitcoin purchases for general corporate purposes. However, its intent is clearly to expand its Bitcoin trove while prices remain depressed.\nThe additional capital injection signals MicroStrategy's continued conviction in Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Saylor is doubling down by acquiring more coins amid the current market turbulence.",

          "description": "Major Wall Street firm Bernstein has made a bullish long-term prediction for Bitcoin's price, saying it could reach $1 million by 2033.\n\nJUST IN: $779 billion Bernstein says #Bitcoin will likely hit $1 million.\nPredicts $200,000 price by 2025 🚀 pic.twitter.com/zBp3o09OoL\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 14, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nIn a new report initiating coverage of Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, Bernstein analysts have raised their price target for Bitcoin to $200,000 from $150,000 by the end of 2025.\nBernstein has long been positive on Bitcoin's prospects, but this $1 million forecast by 2033 represents one of the highest institutional projections yet. The analysts' thesis is based on unprecedented demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs and constrained future supply.\nBernstein's report also highlighted how Michael Saylor \"has become synonymous with brand Bitcoin and has positioned MSTR as a leading Bitcoin company, attracting at-scale capital (both debt and equity) for an active Bitcoin acquisition strategy.\"\n\"MicroStrategy positions itself as an 'active leveraged bitcoin strategy versus passive spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs),' the report said, noting that over the last four years, the company's active strategy has produced a higher Bitcoin per equity share,\" Bernstein wrote.\nBernstein also set a $2,890 price target on MicroStrategy shares, representing nearly double the current price.\nThe bold long-term Bitcoin outlook comes as institutions warm up to Bitcoin, with major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity offering BTC investment products. Bernstein cited inflows into these regulated vehicles as fueling this cycle's exponential Bitcoin price gains.\nThe analysts see MicroStrategy maintaining its first-mover advantage as the world's leading listed Bitcoin player. With BTC adoption still in its infancy, firms like MicroStrategy have room to grow their Bitcoin holdings for years to come.",
