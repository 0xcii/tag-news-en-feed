On the 6th of March, that rate will drop to one token every 8.6 seconds. Summer tokens, which are currently the cheapest of the four, are expected to become the most expensive over the following months as the market adjusts to the lower rate of supply.\n \nThis process has already happened once before, after the Spring halving in Jun…",
