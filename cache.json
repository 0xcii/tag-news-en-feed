          "description": "On Friday, a delegation of lawmakers from  \nSouth Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) conducted a visit to the office of Wemade, the  \nissuer of play-to-earn (P2E) cryptocurrency, Wemix. The visit is part of an ongoing investigation into the crypto holdings of Kim Nam-kuk, former opposition party and now-independent lawmaker, local media Yonhap reports.\nKim reportedly had about 800,000 WEMIX coins worth about six billion won ($4.5 million) in his crypto wallet between January and February 2022. The lawmaker is alleged to have withdrawn his coin holding before South Korea implemented global anti-money laundering body Financial Action Task Force's (FAFT) travel rule in March last year.  The rule demands that crypto exchanges record and report personal data on transactions that exceed a c…",

The network’s difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to find a hash value that meets the required criteria for a new block to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain.

The “Bitcoin social dominance” is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total discussions involving the top 100 assets by market cap that mention BTC.\n \nWhat this metric tells us is how the current interest in BTC among investors compares with that of the altcoins. Historically, high interest in altcoins (meaning that the social dominance of BTC is low) has been a sign of greed in the market.\n \nUsually, markets gain a higher probability of moving opposite to the wider ma…",
