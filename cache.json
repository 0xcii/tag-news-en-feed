          "description": "The decision to extradite Do Kwon to either the US or  \nSouth Korea has been returned to the High Court after the appeal by the  \nTerraform Labs’ Co-Founder, and that of his lawyers was granted by an appellate court  \nin Montenegro.\nKwon's Appeal Granted\nMontenegrin news outlet Vijesti reported today  \n(Friday) that the country’s court of appeals accepted the arguments from Kwon’s  \nlawyers. This action canceled a previous decision by the High Court and sent  \nthe case back for retrial. This move represents the latest legal strategy by  \nKwon’s team to postpone his extradition to either the U.S. or South Korea,  \nwhere he faces multiple criminal charges.\nThe initial ruling from the High Court in Podgorica on  \nApril 8, 2024, determined that Kwon, a South Korean national, could be  \nextradited for prosecution. However, the Court of Appeal found that this  \ndecision lacked decisive facts. Specifically, the High Court failed to provide  \nvalid reasons for its ruling, merely quoting an earlier decision by the Supreme  \nCourt without adequate explanation.\nThe Appellate Court highlighted the necessity of a clear  \ndecision based on legal and factual issues.  When multiple countries request the  \nextradition of the same individual, specific criteria guide the decision. These  \ncriteria are detailed in various international agreements, including the  \nEuropean Convention on Extradition and the 1901 convention between Serbia and the  \nUnited States. The first-instance court had not reportedly adequately examined  \nthese factors in Kwon’s case.\nThe High Court will now determine the case, ensuring  \nKwon's consent to extradition was voluntary, informed, and irrevocable.  Montenegro’s High Court now stands at a  \ncrossroads. The upcoming decision will determine whether Do Kwon will face  \njustice in the United States or South Korea.\nExpect ongoing updates as this story evolves.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.",
