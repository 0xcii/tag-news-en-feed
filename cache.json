The move saw the cryptocurrency hit a one-month high, following a recent five-day bull run. Solana also rose higher, following a sell-off to start the week.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) rose by as much as 8% earlier in today’s session, hitting a one-month high in the process.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.7033 earlier in the day, MATIC/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $0.7473 on Tuesday.\n \nAs a result of this surge, MATIC hit its highest point since June 9, which is the last time the token broke out of a ceiling at $0.7480.\n \n \nMATIC bulls were unable to breach this ceiling in today’s session, with the price retreating from an earlier high.\n \nThis comes despite the relative strength index (RSI) marginally breaking out of a ceiling at 59.00, with a current reading of 59.31.\n \nIn the event the index continues to strengthen, the odds of a breakout above $0.7480 will greatly increase.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nAfter dropping by nearly 7% to start the week, solana (SOL) bulls moved to buy the dip, with price now closing in on a fresh multi-month high.\n \nSOL/USD jumped to a high of $22.29 earlier in the day, which is less than 24 hours after almost falling below $20.00.\n \nTuesday’s peak sees the world’s ninth largest cryptocurrency $0.20 away from a recent two-month high at $22.49.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it seems that traders reentered the market after the RSI hit a support level at 65.00\n \nAs of writing, price strength is at a reading of 69.05, with the next visible resistance zone at 72.00.\n \nShould today’s momentum extend throughout the week, there is a good chance that solana will climb past $23.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect solana bulls to maintain current market sentiment?

The raised capital is expected to fund the fintech startup’s operational and expansion activities. According to a report, Masroofi was able to raise $1.5 million after the company’s directors reportedly rejected funding from investors in the “Shark Tank” program.\n \nAs explained in the African Heroes report, the unnamed participants in Masroofi’s investment round were drawn by the fintech’s focus on the 20 million Egyptian youth aged between five and 20. The track records as well as the rapport between the fintech startups’ co-founders are the other factors that had a positive influence on investors.\n \n\n \nMeanwhile, the report revealed that Masroofi is hoping to reach two million young people within five years. The fintech is also reportedly aiming to grow with its young customers by catering for their evolving needs through the provision of product offerings such as neo banking services.\n \nWhile the co-founders Mostafa Abdel-Khabeer and Sayed Hosni are said to be confident of the fintech sector’s capacity to continue leading Egypt’s startup market, the Africa Heroes report suggested that there is still room for improvement.
