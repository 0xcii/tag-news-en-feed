          "description": "U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres rejected the Securities and Exchange Commission’s interlocutory appeal in the regulator’s lawsuit against Ripple, noting the SEC failed to explain why her prior decision was faulty. Torres set a trial date for April 2024 to address the remaining issues.\n \nSEC’s Appeal in Ripple Lawsuit Denied by Judge Torres, Trial Set for April 2024\n \nIn a decision unveiled Tuesday, the judge at the helm of the SEC’s litigation against Ripple dismissed the regulator’s interlocutory appeal. The SEC had tendered a motion to certify an interlocutory appeal of two judgments pertaining to XRP in the Ripple case.\n \n“The SEC’s motion for certification of interlocutory appeal is denied, and the SEC’s request for a stay is denied as moot,” Torres said in her ruling. Torres explained that the SEC had failed in demonstrating, within its appeal, that the decision was markedly faulty.\n \nRewinding to July, she decreed that Ripple’s Programmatic Sales of XRP “did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts.” She further articulated that concerning Programmatic Sales, XRP “is not necessarily a security on its face.”\n \n \nConversely, Torres’ verdict posited that institutional sales could be perceived as security transactions. In the wake of the verdict on Tuesday, XRP initially ascended by about 6% post-announcement, although it has relinquished a small fraction of those gains since then.\n \nWhat do you think about Judge Torres’ decision?

Many people share a similar view, including Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki, who has frequently cautioned against investing in the U.S. dollar and other fiat currencies, which he labels “fake” money.\n \nElon Musk Thinks Fiat Currency Is a Scam\n \nThe CEO of Tesla and Spacex, Elon Musk, believes that fiat currency is a scam. In a post on social media platform X, user Wall Street Silver shared an image with a question on Sunday: “What’s a scam that’s so normalized that we don’t even realize it’s a scam anymore?” Musk replied: “Fiat currency.”\n \n\n \n \nMusk has long been critical of fiat currency. In February 2021, he tweeted, “When fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere.” He also compared fiat currency to BTC, stating: “Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money.” Nonetheless, he added: “The true battle is between fiat & crypto. On balance, I support the latter.”\n \nThe Tesla boss is not the only one who holds the view that fiat currency is a scam, fraud, or Ponzi scheme. Vailshire Capital founder Jeff Ross described on X Tuesday: “The fiat currency system exists to methodically extract purchasing power from its participants.” Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has also called the U.S. dollar a scam, and predicted the demise of the USD. The famous author refers to fiat money as “fake money,” while gold and silver are “God’s money” and bitcoin is “people’s money.” He wrote in July: “Giant crash [is] coming … Get into real gold, silver, bitcoin asap … End of fiat (fake) money [is] near.”\n \nDo you agree with Elon Musk that fiat currency is a scam?
