          "description": "XRP was one of Friday’s notable crypto gainers, rallying to a one-month high earlier in today’s session. Bullish sentiment returned to end the week, with the global market cap trading nearly 1.5% higher as of writing. Solana also surged, moving back above the $20.00 mark.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was one of today’s biggest movers, climbing by as much as 5% earlier in the day.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.5036 yesterday, XRP/USD raced to a peak of $0.5455 during Friday’s session.\n \nThis resulted in the token hitting its highest point since August 29, which is the last time price hit a ceiling of $0.5490.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it appears that the move came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose beyond a ceiling of its own at 56.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 58.67, with the next visible point of support near the 60.00 mark.\n \nIn the event the 60.00 ceiling is broken, there is a good chance that XRP will climb beyond $0.5500.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nIn addition to XRP, solana (SOL) also rallied strongly on Friday, rising above $20.00 in the process.\n \nSOL/USD climbed to a high of $20.32 earlier in today’s session, following Thursday’s low at $19.22.\n \nThis surge has seen solana hit a nine-day high, which comes after three straight days of bullish momentum.\n \n \nOverall, the uptrend comes as the 10-day (red) moving average rose above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nBulls are likely now targeting a higher resistance level of $21.00, which would result in a four-week high.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould solana hit $21.00 this weekend?

The liquidators seek to maximize returns for the hedge fund’s creditors and will initiate further court proceedings as necessary.\n \nThe arrest and subsequent sentencing of Zhu follow the earlier granting of a committal order on September 25. This order was obtained due to Zhu’s intentional non-compliance with a court directive that required his cooperation with the liquidators’ investigations. \n \nSpecifically, Zhu was obligated to provide a detailed account of his activities as a co-founder of 3AC and its former investment manager.\n \nA similar committal order was also issued against Kyle Davies, the other co-founder of Three Arrows Capital. However, Davies’ current whereabouts remain unknown, according to Teneo.\n \n \nThe liquidators have consistently prioritized the recovery of 3AC’s assets and maximized returns for its creditors throughout the process. Their efforts focus on retrieving 3AC’s property and assets acquired using the fund’s funds. \n \nLastly, Teneo emphasized that they will continue to work diligently towards these objectives, potentially seeking additional court orders to facilitate the process.\n \n \nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",
