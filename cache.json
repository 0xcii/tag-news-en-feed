The first presents its speculative side, while the second, grassroots-focused use case seeks to substitute payment channels in sanctioned countries, serving as a hedge against devaluation and inflation.\n \nBitcoin mining is also an emergent activity on the continent, with companies seeking to take advantage of the cheap power tariffs and ideal climates that countries like Paraguay and Argentina offer to incoming mining companies.\n \nThe region is home to El Salvador, the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, which is now facing various challenges stemming from the emergence of this currency in a dollar-dominated economy.\n \nBitcoin.com News sends Latam news directly to readers’ email inboxes, helping them understand Latin American crypto events and developments by putting them in context of the economic reality of the region.
