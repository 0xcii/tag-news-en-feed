No matter how many fancy perks there are, unless there’s a strong mission and an enticing model of work in an organization, flashy offices lose their appeal really fast.\n \nBinance has never put much stock in superior office comfort as a means of attracting and retaining top talent. Don’t get them wrong – their offices offer some of these perks as well, but they’re never the main reason employees want to stay with the organization.
