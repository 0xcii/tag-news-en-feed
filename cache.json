          "description": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday asked for additional public feedback on a proposal to list a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), likely delaying any decision on the high-profile applications.\n \nSEC Seeks Public Opinion on Spot Bitcoin ETF\n \nThe SEC put out a 34-page request for comment on the Ark Invest and 21Shares application, seeking views on whether the proposal meets regulatory standards. The move pushes any decision on the bitcoin ETF beyond the initially reported August deadline.\n \nThe agency asked for public input on concerns around potential manipulation of the proposed ETF and the underlying bitcoin market. It raised questions about whether the CME bitcoin futures market is a “regulated market of significant size” for the spot ETF.\n \nThe SEC also seeks feedback on the liquidity and efficiency of bitcoin markets and plans for the ETF sponsors to share surveillance data with the agency. “Written data, views, and arguments” are due in 21 days, the request details.\n \n \nThis marks the latest roadblock for approval of a spot bitcoin ETF after years of applications. The SEC has greenlighted bitcoin futures ETFs but resisted spot funds over worries about manipulation and insufficient regulation of crypto markets.\n \nFriday’s request likely extends the long wait for a spot bitcoin ETF, which issuers say would provide a safer way for mainstream investors to gain exposure. The SEC will weigh the new feedback before making any final decision on the Ark and 21Shares application. The senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas, said the SEC move was “pretty standard.”\n \nWhat do you think about the SEC’s request for comment from the public?

          "description": "Friday morning, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) solicited comments on 21 Shares and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest's spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, further delaying the process.\n\n\n\nThis is the second delay in the listing process for this ETF, with the first delay happening earlier this year. The third deadline for the SEC's decision is scheduled for later this year for November 11. If the SEC delays the application again, it will go to its fourth and final deadline on January 10, 2024. \nThe race for approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States gained huge momentum earlier this year when the worlds largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed for one of their own. After that, big institutions including Fidelity, VanEck and WisdomTree among others, piled in and filed for their own spot Bitcoin ETFs.  \nThe first mover advantage of being the first to have its Bitcoin ETF approved and listed may prove to be vital in its performance. Galaxy Digital CEO and billionaire Mike Novogratz said in an earnings call earlier this week, \"The news of both BlackRock filing ETF and quite frankly, Invesco plus Galaxy, we're going to fight like cats and dogs to win market share there once it gets approved. It's a big, big deal.\"\nEarlier this year on July 27, the SEC approved a leveraged, 2x Bitcoin futures ETF, which leaves many scratching their heads as to how that is safe for investors, but not a spot ETF. Grayscale, who is currently in a legal battle with the SEC over the denial of its spot Bitcoin ETF application, sent a letter to the U.S. Court of Appeals protesting exactly this. \n\n\n\nMore information on the spot Bitcoin ETF race can be found here.",

However, I was persuaded to put prejudice to one side and evaluate it as I would any other technology I was doing due diligence on. After evaluating the claims and data from both sides I reached the conclusion that on net balance, Bitcoin had the unique ability to solve more than one difficult-to-solve climate-change issue.\nFirst, some context: I have been a climate activist since the 1990s.
