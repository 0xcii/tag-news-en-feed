In 2023, it outperformed the S&P 500, high-yield corporate bonds, and gold, soaring as much as 156 percent in a year. \nToday, Bitcoin demand is reaching record highs as the approval of new spot Bitcoin ETFs has created a wave of institutional interest. \nAlthough dubbed a risky and volatile asset, Bitcoin remains a profitable investment, especially for its earliest investors. When it was launched in 2009, it was practically worthless. In 2010, it traded at $0.10. \nBy 2013, it was hitting highs of $250—a 250,000 percent growth for early investors.

This comes after spot bitcoin ETFs saw a record monthly volume of $111 billion in March, triple that of February.\nThe ETFs debuted on January 11th when bitcoin traded around $45,000. Since then, bitcoin has climbed to an all-time high above $73,000, buoying interest and trading activity.\nBlackRock's IBIT leads the volumes, which now hold over 265,000 bitcoins worth more than $18 billion. IBIT comprises nearly 50% of the total spot ETF volume. Meanwhile, Grayscale's GBTC and Fidelity's FBTC rank second and third in market share.\nThe success of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs has prompted applications in other markets like Hong Kong. Regulators there are expected to approve the first spot bitcoin ETFs in Asia this month, potentially adding more volume.\nETF providers cite surging institutional demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. The funds present an easy vehicle for both retail and professional investors to gain bitcoin price exposure.\nThe $200 billion cumulative volume indicates growing bitcoin's maturation since the last bull run when ETF hopes were repeatedly dashed.\nThe growth of bitcoin ETFs signals widening adoption by traditional finance, a mainstream integration that will likely persist as the asset class evolves.",
