Dogecoin was also down, hitting a two-week low earlier today.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) was down on Monday, as the meme coin moved to its lowest point in the past 20 days.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.000009282, SHIB/USD was down by nearly 5% today, hitting a low of $0.000008794 in the process.\n \nThis bottom is the lowest point that SHIB has traded at since November 22, when the token was at a low of $0.00000817.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, the move comes as shiba inu broke out of a floor at the $0.00000885 mark.\n \nThe 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also fell, dropping below a floor at the 43.70 level in the process.\n \nShould this bearish momentum continue, we could see SHIB sellers attempt to recapture the low last seen on November 22.\n \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) also remained in the red to start the week, as it also declined for a fourth straight day.\n \nDOGE/USD declined to an intraday low of $0.08729 on Monday, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $0.09682.\n \nAs a result of this decline, which saw DOGE drop by nearly 10%, the token hit its lowest point since November 25.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, bearish momentum has recently intensified following a drop below a floor of 48.00 on the RSI.\n \nThe 10-day (red) moving average also appears to be heading towards its 25-day (blue) counterpart, with a downward cross looking inevitable.\n \nShould this crossover take place, it is likely that DOGE will move even lower, with a floor of $0.080 a possible destination.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect dogecoin prices to fall further this week?

          "description": "Justice officials are reportedly deciding whether they have sufficient evidence to bring charges against the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nA Reuters report stated that several sources close to the investigation claim there is deliberation on whether to not to file charges against individual Binance executives including CEO Changpeng Zhao.\nOthers within the investigating entities, which include the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), have argued in favor of reviewing more evidence. \nThe investigation, which was launched nearly two years ago, comes at a precarious time for the industry as it reels from the collapse of FTX.\n\nBinance has responded to the Reuters report, stating on Twitter, “Reuters has it wrong again. Now they're attacking our incredible law enforcement team. A team that we're incredibly proud of - they've made crypto more secure for all of us,” with a link below to a blog post highlighting their claims of the competency of their security team. \nAccording to Reuters’ sources, “discussions included potential plea deals,” in relation to charges of “unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy and criminal sanctions violations.” \nAs the news source notes, the investing bodies could bring an indictment against Binance and executives at the company, could accept a settlement or could do nothing to the company. Binance has reportedly argued that “A criminal prosecution would wreak havoc on a crypto market already in a prolonged downturn.”\nThe cryptocurrency exchange responded to the investigation by hiring a former chief of MLARS, Kendall Day, who reportedly has been meeting with Justice officials and communicating with investigators. \nBinance is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange with a 24 hour trading volume of about $10.5 billion on the day of reporting. A separate U.S. entity exists, Binance.US. The international company does not have an official headquarters according to the CEO.",
