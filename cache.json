In the last month, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has seen a surge exceeding 24%, and 17% in just the past two weeks.\n \nBitcoin Breaks Through $44K Barrier, Reaching Peak Levels Since Pre-Terra Crash\n \nThis week, bitcoin has been on a remarkable ascent, escalating 14% against the U.S. dollar. On December 5, Tuesday, BTC achieved a zenith of $44,011 at 12:15 p.m. Eastern Time. Currently, BTC’s trading volume stands at $31.68 billion, a figure that is twice as high as the previous day’s. The trading range for bitcoin during the day fluctuated from $41,453 to a little over $44,000.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nThe value of BTC hasn’t reached these heights since April 6, 2022, before the Terra market collapse. Despite a trading volume of $31 billion, BTC’s dominant trading pairs are USDT, FDUSD, USD, USDC, and KRW. Today’s top exchanges for global BTC trading volume include major platforms like Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, and Bitfinex.\n \nBTC’s trading volume on Tuesday ranks second, trailing only behind the stablecoin tether (USDT). The recent surge in crypto prices has led to the liquidation of $160 million in shorts over the last 24 hours. Of these, approximately $91.34 million originated from bitcoin (BTC) short positions. The ascendancy of this crypto asset has propelled its market dominance to 51.3% amidst a combined value of over $1.65 trillion across more than 10,000 assets.\n \n \nMoreover, bitcoin has eclipsed the market capitalization of Meta, following its overtaking of Berkshire Hathaway’s total valuation. This latest price increase positions BTC as the ninth-largest asset in terms of market valuation, a list that includes companies, precious metals, and exchange-traded funds.\n \nWhat do you think about bitcoin tapping the $44K mark on Tuesday?

Included in the Genesis block that started the Bitcoin blockchain is a headline from The Times speaking to bank bailouts at the time.\n \nWhile central bankers print money at a whim and inflate the money supply, there will ever only be 21 million BTC. 15 years later, Satoshi’s invention is winning in the war against the traditional banking system.\n \n \nSince the start of the year, there has been weakness in the banking sector due to economic distress, rising interest rates, and a flight of capital from regional banks. The weakness in banks and strength in Bitcoin recently could send BTC versus banks to new all-time highs.\n \n\n \n \nBTCUSD Versus BKX Flirts With New All-Time Highs\n \nPutting BTCUSD up against the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, representing the 24 largest “national money centers, regional banks and thrift institutions,” we can see that Bitcoin is poised to make new all-time highs.\n \nWhile the dollar has been strong in 2022 and 2023, the banking sector has not, hence the discrepancy between BTC trading against the BKX and USD.\n \n \nIn the past, however, all-time highs in the BKX has translated into new record highs on the dollar trading pair, so the price action remains significant.\n \nBitcoin price is currently at $43,700 and climbing, making all-time highs about $25,000 away still.
