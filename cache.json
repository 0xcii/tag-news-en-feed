          "description": "Uncle Sam made off with more than $215 million this month as it began to liquidate portions of seized bitcoin.\nThe United States government has been selling bitcoin confiscated from the Silk Road case in 2013. \nAccording to a court filing, the government sold 9,861.1707894 Bitcoin on March 14, 2023, for a total of $215,738,154.98. After transaction fees, the net proceeds for the government were $215,522,416.83. The government also revealed that there are still around 41,490.72 bitcoin left to be sold, which they plan to sell in four more batches over the course of this year.\nPreviously, the government has auctioned bitcoin, opting instead to proceed with open market sales this time.\nThe Silk Road was a darknet marketplace that was used to sell drugs, amongst other services. Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road, was convicted in 2015 and sentenced to life in prison. Ulbricht now seeks clemency, as a double life sentence without parole for entirely non-violent charges illustrates the government’s desire to make an example of those who build platforms outside their jurisdiction. \nBitcoin Magazine recently opened an art gallery in Nashville, Tennessee, which currently houses a life-size jail cell Ross Ulbricht exhibit, including art that Ulbricht made in prison, as well as writing from ulbricht. \nBitcoin’s price action as of late has been exciting for those who watched it fall from all-time highs of $69,000, to local lows of less than $16,000. While the government has been selling bitcoin, other institutions like MicroStrategy have been acquiring it.",

The license allows the exchange to provide institutional investors the ability to trade bitcoin on the platform as well as to act as a custodian. \nThe exchange has been offering custody services through its Blocknox platform since January 2020, under a provisional license. With this new licensing, it will join the ranks of several major international firms officially entering into the bitcoin custodial and trading industry as of late. \nFidelity opened their bitcoin trading platform to the public this month, allowing institutional investors the option to hold their bitcoin with them as well. In addition to that, Latin America’s largest e-commerce platform by market value, Mercado Libre, introduced bitcoin trading to their Chilean users, which was already available in Brazil. \nIt should be noted that all of these platforms bear the risks associated with third-party custody of your bitcoin. The safest way to ensure your bitcoin is always accessible and always available is through self-custody, using a dedicated bitcoin wallet. Platforms like Boerse Stuttgart Digital and Fidelity have made bitcoin trading available to investors on these platforms, but do not necessarily further enable the true potential of bitcoin adoption.",
