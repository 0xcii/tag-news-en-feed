According to the lawsuit, during the service interruption, the average number of orders per hour doubled, causing transaction flows to significantly slow down.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nA district court initially ruled in favor of Bithumb against the investors. However, the decision was subsequently overturned by an appellate court, which ordered Bithumb to pay damages ranging from 8,000 won to 8 million won to each of the 132 investors. The supreme court upheld this ruling Thursday.\n \n\n \nAccording to the appellate court:\n \n\nThe burden or the cost of technological failures should be shouldered by the service operator, not service users who pay commission for the service.\n \n\n \nDo you think cryptocurrency exchanges should be held accountable for service outages that cause monetary losses to investors?
