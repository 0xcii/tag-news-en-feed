Most attributed this drop to curtailment activity in Texas. While Texas does represent 17% of the global bitcoin hashrate, ERCOT data shows that some of the curtailment activity was a combination of higher prices and “good grid citizenship.” In ERCOT, and to a lesser extent in other ISOs, prices are the best proxy for grid stress. There are other proxies such as PRC (physical responsive capability) but prices are a better measure for most situations. For that reason, in order to prevent swings in prices and create more challenging gird conditions, an optimal environment is one in which the price does not swing wildly up and down. However, price volatility is a frequent occurre…",
