This marks a substantial increase of 447,651 shares from the 2,450,400 shares reported in May. Notably, the filing also revealed that the board no longer holds any position in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a change from May when it reported holding 1,013,000 shares. \n \n                         \n                         \n                         \n                     \n                    \nEarlier this year in May, SWIB became the first state pension to buy spot Bitcoin ETFs, signaling a another big milestone in the integration of Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios. The board's decision to increase its investment in IBIT highlights a growing preference for direct Bitcoin exposure through spot ETFs, reflecting broader institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. \nDespite the recent downward price action in Bitcoin, money continues to pour into the spot Bitcoin ETFs, with a total combined inflow of $243.06 million since July 24.\n\nU.S. 🇺🇸 Bitcoin Spot ETFs 👇 2 consecutive days of inflows pic.twitter.com/8txUOkdT61\n— HODL15Capital 🇺🇸 (@HODL15Capital) August 14, 2024",
