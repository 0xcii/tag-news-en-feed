          "description": "Bitcoin cash (BCH) was one of Wednesday’s biggest gainers, as markets remained jubilant following the Grayscale court ruling. Following a recent streak of consolidation, the global crypto market cap rose by as much as 4% on the news. toncoin (TON) also surged, climbing nearly 16% higher.\n \nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n \nBitcoin cash (BCH) was a notable gainer on Wednesday, as the price was once again trading above the $200 level. BCH/USD peaked at $227.03 late on Tuesday’s session, following a low at $192.77 earlier in the day.\n \nThe move saw the price breakout out of a resistance level of $225.00, hitting a two-week high in the process.\n \n \nAs of writing this, earlier gains have since eased, with the cryptocurrency once again trading below the aforementioned ceiling.\n \nThis came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with its own resistance level at 60.00. In the event bulls manage to orchestrate a breakout, BCH will likely be above $240.00.\n \n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nFor a second straight session, toncoin (TON) surged considerably higher, with today’s gains seeing a price jump of over 12%.\n \nFollowing a low of $1.52 on Tuesday, TON/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $1.75 earlier in today’s session. This resulted in the cryptocurrency climbing to its highest point since June 5, when the price was at $1.77.\n \n \nAfter peaking at 70.41 less than 24 hours ago, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 75.38.\n \nMany now expect an upcoming reversal, due to TON being highly overbought, as a result of this recent bull run.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill a price reversal occur in the coming days?

          "description": "In the evolving Bitcoin market, stories of missed opportunities and astonishing deals abound – however, few are as eye-popping as this sale from August 30, 2010. \nUnearthed by Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo, a BitcoinTalk thread shows how an early Bitcoin user amassed 30,000 BTC, only to sell them for $0.03 each. \nThen sold below market price, roughly $0.06 at the time, the sale netted $900. The same amount of Bitcoin, if sold today, would be worth over $810,000,000. \n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \nWhile few could have predicted the meteoric rise of Bitcoin to $27,000 in the years to come, it seems the seller in this case might have been motivated by an interest in disproving that the cryptocurrency would work at all. \nThough there is only speculation in the thread, it shows that market participants at the time believed the seller to be William “Nenolod” Pitcock, a data center employee who is said to have amassed close to 100,000 BTC that he liquidated in 2010. \nSpeaking about another sale in July, he discussed his motivation was to spark a “bank rush,” writing: “The purpose was to demonstrate in two ways that the Bitcoin system can be attacked… [and] cause speculation in the bitcoin economy.”\nWhile no connection between the events can be substantiated, the thread, buried in the archives of an early Bitcoin user forum, serves as a time capsule, transporting readers back to a moment when the true potential of Bitcoin was still shrouded in uncertainty.\nWhile some may view it as a painful reminder of missed opportunities, others see it as a testament to the enduring allure that Bitcoin has created over the years.\nEither wary, thanks to the sale, some lucky Bitcoiners were able to get bids filled at once-in-a-lifetime prices.",
