          "description": "On July 12, 2023, onchain data shows the U.S. government transferred 9,800 bitcoins (BTC), worth just over $300 million. These bitcoins originally came from James Zhong’s Silk Road hack. In March, the Department of Justice also moved a similar amount of bitcoins associated with Silk Road.\n \nSilk Road Bitcoin Stash Controlled by the Feds Moves, Funds Reportedly Sent to Coinbase\n \nAbout 9,800 BTC from Silk Road was moved in two transactions on Wednesday, reportedly sent to wallets controlled by Coinbase. At the time of writing, the funds held by the U.S. government are worth $302 million, based on the day’s BTC exchange rates.\n \nThe bitcoins came from James Zhong, the convicted Silk Road hacker. At the time of his arrest, federal authorities seized about 51,351.89785803 bitcoins on three separate occasions, along with a collection of precious metals and $661,900 in cash.\n \n \n🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔\n8999.90799037 #BTC sent by #US_DEPARTMENT_OF_JUSTICE (Seizure – James Zhong Via Silk Road Exploit)\n🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔\n \n️ https://t.co/r4wif5icol\n \n— OXTObserver (@OXTObserver) July 12, 2023\n \n\n \nLast March, the government sold 9,861 bitcoins for just over $200 million. The onchain activity four months prior was also detected by onchain observers and blockchain parsers. It’s speculated that all the BTC transferred from Zhong’s stash has been sold on Coinbase.\n \n \nThe selling through Coinbase is unusual as the U.S. government typically auctions off BTC with assistance from the U.S. Marshals. For example, bitcoins seized from Ross Ulbricht in the Silk Road case were auctioned, with investors like Tim Draper purchasing some of the coins. Only recently has the government started moving cryptocurrency to spot exchanges.\n \nWhat do you think about the feds sending a large stash of bitcoin on Wednesday?

Inflation fell by 1.0% from May, coming in at 3.0% last month. Polkadot also rose, extending its winning run for a third straight day.\n \nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n \nBitcoin cash (BCH) rose by as much as 6% earlier in today’s session. BCH/USD surged to a peak of $289.49 earlier in the day, which comes following Tuesday’s bottom at $271.44.\n \nThis rise in price has pushed the cryptocurrency towards a ceiling at $300.00, and closer to a recent 15-month high at $329.71.\n \n \nFrom the chart, the move occurred after a marginal breakout of a ceiling at 68.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 70.56, with the next visible point of resistance at 73.00.\n \nShould this point be hit, there is a strong chance that BCH will be trading at or over $300.00.\n \n \nPolkadot (DOT)\n \nPolkadot (DOT) rose for a third consecutive day during Wednesday’s session, as price neared a one-week high.\n \nAfter falling to a low at $5.13 on Tuesday, DOT/USD jumped to an intraday high of $5.30 earlier today.\n \nThis is the strongest level the token has hit since last Thursday, when it peaked at $5.37, marginally below a ceiling at $5.40.\n \n \nSince today’s peak, earlier gains have somewhat slipped, as a result of the RSI colliding with a ceiling at 55.00.\n \nCurrently, price strength is at a reading of 54.55, with DOT now trading $0.05 lower than its previous high.\n \nIn the event this ceiling is broken, the next target for polkadot bulls will likely be $5.50.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill the Federal Reserve hike rates despite today’s inflation report?
