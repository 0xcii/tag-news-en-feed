This ruling, made in November 2022, concurred with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stating that LBRY presented its digital assets as securities or investment contracts.\n \nUnregistered Crypto Securities Saga: LBRY Challenges SEC Amid Wider Crypto Scrutiny\n \nThe LBRY project has lodged its intention to contest U.S. district judge Paul Barbadoro’s ruling, which determined LBRY peddled unregistered securities. On November 7, 2022, the court greenlit the SEC’s summary judgment request, deeming LBRY, Inc. in breach of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.\n \nAfter the verdict, LBRY faced a fine of $111,614 and was “permanently restrained” from any security offerings based in the United States. The blockchain project stood as the first crypto venture to square off with the SEC in such a case.\n \nSubsequently, the U.S. securities watchdog has launched a plethora of enforcement actions, tagging numerous crypto assets as “unregistered securities.”\n \n \nCurrently, these alleged crypto securities boast a combined valuation surpassing $78 billion. Amid the extensive list spotlighted by the SEC, LBRY is the 36th largest by market capitalization.\n \nTimothy McLaughlin from the law firm Shaheen & Gordon submitted LBRY’s intention to appeal. On the social media network X (previously known as Twitter), LBRY announced it had “filed a Notice of Appeal against the SEC.”\n \nWhat do you think about LBRY appealing the New Hampshire court’s verdict?

The crypto exchange said it expects as many as 80,000 participants and has promised a reward of just over $64 for those completing the course. \n \nImproving the Public’s Knowledge and Understanding of Cryptocurrencies\n \nAn Australian cryptocurrency exchange, Swyftx, said it plans to financially reward users who participate and complete learning courses offered via its crypto education platform. Known as “Earn and Learn,” the platform, which was formally launched on Sept. 6, represents the crypto exchange’s attempt to improve the public’s knowledge and understanding of cryptocurrencies.\n \nAccording to a recent report, Swyftx’s courses will cover different cryptocurrency scams and how users can identify them. Tom Matthews, who heads the crypto exchange’s corporate affairs, said the educational initiative also seeks to make users tough targets for scammers.\n \n\n \nAs recently reported by Bitcoin.com News, cybercriminals are thought to have stolen nearly $1 billion via scams, rug pulls and exploits in just the first eight months of 2023. Criminals are believed to have used the same modus operandi to steal close to $46 million in the month of August alone.\n \nTherefore, in order to help users avoid falling for similar crypto scams or compromised projects, Swyftx said its educational courses will include a checklist for evaluating tokens and crypto projects.\n \nFor users who complete the course, Swyftx is promising a reward of just over $64 (AUD100) while those who complete the initial fundamental analysis course will receive $3.2 worth of BTC. The crypto exchange reportedly said it is expecting as many as 80,000 participants.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",
