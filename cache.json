          "description": "The financial giant will now allow customers to trade bitcoin, although they will not be able to withdraw it to self-custody.\nCustomers of Fidelity Investments can now buy bitcoin through Fidelity Digital Assets. The Fidelity Crypto platform, first opened to a waitlist in November 2022, is now available to the public, as of yesterday.\nCustomers are able to buy and sell bitcoin, although they will not be able to transfer it to a self-custody wallet where the user controls their private keys. During the launch of the waitlist, there was mention of this ability to come later, but no detail or roadmap has been provided beyond that.\nWhen trading, customers will not be charged a “fee,” but a 1% spread, which Fidelity has defined as “the difference between the price at which you buy or sell crypto in your Fidelity Crypto account and the price at which Fidelity Digital Assets fills your order.” This spread will be visible in the client execution price.\nTrading will only be available to U.S. citizens over the age of 18 in eligible states.\nFidelity’s foray into cryptocurrency has not been without criticism, with a group of senators, stating in a letter to the financial firm: \n“Fidelity Investments has opted to expand beyond traditional finance and delve into the highly unstable and increasingly risky digital asset market.”\nBut that seemingly hasn’t stopped Fidelity. \nWhile their introduction of the service to the public may be welcomed, it is specifically during moments like the current banking crisis that extra emphasis should be placed upon self-custody. Trust in institutions that are exceptionally large, similar to Fidelity, is what has led to the fiasco seen over the last week. \nSo, while Fidelity is often regarded as a highly-trusted institution, it should still be noted that trusted third-parties are security holes, and that the only true way to sovereignly use bitcoin is through the holding of one’s own private keys.",

          "description": "Dogecoin rebounded from a recent decline on Friday, as cryptocurrency markets shook off yesterday’s bear wave. The meme coin has now risen by over 5%, a day after falling by the same sum. Chainlink was another notable mover, as prices climbed by over 7%.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) rose by as much as 5% in today’s session, as the meme coin recovered from yesterday’s bear run.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.07007 on Thursday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.07579 earlier today.\n \nThe move came as dogecoin bulls bought yesterday’s dip, which saw prices fall to a floor at the $0.07000 mark.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the rally also coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) breaking out of a ceiling at the 45.00 mark.\n \nAs of writing, the index is marginally above this point, with a current reading of 45.52.\n \nThe next visible point of resistance appears to be a ceiling at 47.00, which seems to be a reason why earlier bulls have begun to abandon previous positions.\n \n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nIn addition to DOGE, chainlink (LINK) was also in the green in today’s session, with prices trading by as much as 7% higher.\n \nLINK/USD rose to a peak of $7.17 earlier in today’s session, after falling to a floor at $6.57 the day prior.\n \nFriday’s rally came after LINK bears failed to sustain a breakout at a long-term support point of $6.60.\n \n \nHowever, bulls were able to move past a point of resistance at 50.00 on the RSI, which was one of the catalysts of today’s climb.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 52.71, which is close to a ceiling at the 54.00 zone.\n \nIn the short-term bulls may attempt to send the token to $7.50, however there appear to be several obstacles in the way that could prevent this.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you believe that chainlink will hit $7.50 this weekend?
