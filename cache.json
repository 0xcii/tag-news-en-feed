Orbit Chain is trying to communicate with the group responsible for the attack and has asked cryptocurrency exchanges to freeze stolen assets. \nOrbit Bridge Hacked, Losses Registered for Over $81.5 Million\nIn one of the first hacks of 2024, Orbit Bridge, an interoperability blockchain solution, faced an attack that drained over $81.5 million in cryptocurrency assets. First detected by X user Kgjr, who alerted about a possible asset drain, the incident allowed hackers to withdraw $30 million in USDT, $10 million in USDC and DAI, in addition to almost 231 WBTC and 9,500 ETH, to five different fresh wallets.\nOrbit Chain’s team has acknowledged the incident and is trying to contact the attackers, sending two messages with undisclosed intentions. In the same way, Orbit announced that it requested the help of all major exchanges to freeze these funds.\nOn X, Orbit declared:\nWe are in close contact with law enforcement agencies, and we are working diligently to track down and freeze the assets that have been stolen.\nDue to the method used, X sleuth Tay has linked this hack with the work of North Korean hackers, alerting that 2024 might be a year of billion of dollars in incidents linked to these groups. Orbit has acknowledged the possibility of this link, explaining that “following a thorough review of the claim, an appropriate response plan will be developed.”\nOrbit also called for users to be vigilant against scams that promise to refund and reimburse any losses caused by the hack, clarifying that any new information regarding this incident will be shared through appropriate channels.\nRecent reports revealed that at least $1.7 billion was lost in this kind of incident during 2023.\nWhat do you think about the Orbit Bridge hack and its possible relation with North Korean groups?
