The move comes as traders continue to worry about what the recent Binance and Coinbase lawsuits could mean for the wider market. Solana also slipped to a multi-month low.\n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) plunged to a three-month low on Thursday, as traders remained nervous, following the recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits.\n \nAfter a high of $0.3376 on Wednesday, ADA/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.3196 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe drop pushed the token to its lowest level since March 15, when price was at a bottom of $0.3166.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, this decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) moved deep into oversold territory, falling to a low below 30.00.\n \nThe index has since rebounded, and is tracking at 34.21, which is marginally above a key level of resistance at the 33.00 mark.\n \nShould this upward momentum continue, bulls will look to recapture the $0.3500 level.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nIn addition to ADA, solana (SOL) sank to a multi-month low of its own during today’s session.\n \nSOL/USD fell to an intraday low of $18.29 on Thursday, which comes less than a day after the price was above $20.00.\n \nAs a result of this latest decline, solana fell to its weakest point since March 13, when the price was under $18.00.\n \n \nOverall, SOL is down by almost 9% in the last seven days, with the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) in free fall as a result.\n \nShould the trend line maintain its current course, there will be a downward cross with the 25-day (blue) MA.\n \nFor bears who still remain despite the recent oversold status, the next target will likely be $16.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould solana fall to $16.00 this week?
