A Spanish judge released the man who has since denied the allegations.\n \nCao de Benos Released Without Conditions\n \nThe Spanish police announced on Dec. 1 that it had arrested a man accused by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) of contracting with jailed Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith to help North Korea evade sanctions. Alejandro Cao de Benos, who used a false identity, was caught in Barcelona while preparing to leave for Madrid.\n \nAccording to a Reuters report, the DOJ has previously accused Cao de Benos of asking Griffith to use his expertise to assist North Korea in busting U.S. sanctions. Griffith is now serving a more than 5-year sentence for his supposed role in the conspiracy.\n \n\n \nFollowing his arrest, Cao de Benos, who founded the Korea Friendship Association, appeared before a Spanish judge who has since released him without conditions. After his release, Cao de Benos immediately pleaded his innocence in a post on X (formerly Twitter). He added that there would be no extradition.\n \n“There is no extradition. The US accusation, besides being false, does not exist in Spain,” Cao de Benos said on X.\n \nHowever, according to an unnamed Spanish judicial source, the U.S. now has to formalize the process to have Cao de Benos extradited. If convicted, Cao de Benos faces up to 20 years in prison.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",

Over the past week, bitcoin has witnessed an 8.4% increase and a 3% rise in the past 24 hours, achieving a peak that the cryptocurrency hadn’t seen in 20 months.\n \nBitcoin Rises Above the $40K Zone\n \n\n \nBitcoin (BTC) reached a peak previously last observed in early April 2022, as its value per unit soared beyond the $40,000 threshold. The intraday trading saw the cryptocurrency’s price fluctuating from a low of $39,309 to a high of $40,846 per BTC. This surge in price brings bitcoin’s total market capitalization to $795.87 billion, accounting for 50% of the entire $1.593 trillion crypto economy.\n \n\n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSince the start of the year, BTC has experienced a remarkable 140% rise against the U.S. dollar, and in the past month alone, this leading cryptocurrency has increased by just over 49%. Currently, bitcoin boasts a global trade volume of $17.93 billion, with its primary trading pair at this moment being tether (USDT). Following tether, the top trading pairs for BTC include FDUSD, USD, USDC, and KRW.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nOn Sunday, the Korean won constitutes 4.88% of BTC’s total trade volume, with the cryptocurrency witnessing a ‘Kimchi premium‘ on exchanges such as Bithumb and Upbit. While BTC trades at $40,798, it’s being exchanged at a notably higher $42,249 on Bithumb. This represents a significant premium of $1,451 per unit compared to the global average price.
