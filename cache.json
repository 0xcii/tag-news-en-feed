          "description": "In hindsight, all it took for real institutional adoption of Bitcoin to take place was the introduction of a risk-minimized, easy-to-use product in the form of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). In January, the SEC approved nine new ETFs that provide exposure to Bitcoin through the spot market, a strict improvement over the futures-based ETFs that began trading back in 2021. In the first quarter of trading, both the size and number of institutional allocations to these ETFs have blown away consensus expectations. Blackrock’s ETF alone set a record for the shortest time an ETF has hit $10 billion in assets.\nBeyond the eye-popping AUM figures these ETFs have drawn, this past Wednesday marked the deadline for institutions with over $100 million in assets to report their holdings to the SEC throug…",

          "description": "Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. attracted $1.8 billion in inflows last week, their 18th consecutive record day of demand. The surge comes as the successful Bitcoin ETFs continue maturing.\nTrading volumes across Bitcoin ETFs also rose 55% week-over-week to $12.8 billion. The past week's haul was Bitcoin funds' largest since mid-March when Bitcoin hit nearly $74,000.\nSignificantly, the ETFs acquired around 25,700 BTC last week, almost equal to the entire new Bitcoin supply mined during that period. This absorption of new supply is tightening the market.\nThe wave of inflows this month has already surpassed May's total inflows. It follows the regulatory embrace of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.K., Australia and Thailand, while political winds are also shifting positively.\nWith total assets under management across Bitcoin ETFs now exceeding $70 billion, the funds continue legitimising Bitcoin as an institutional asset class. Their uninterrupted demand streak further cements Bitcoin's reputation.\n\nNEW: Global Spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold over $70 billion in #Bitcoin \nThat's 5% of the BTC supply 🤯 pic.twitter.com/NYqldI5SIn\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 10, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nThe past week's activity shows investors increasingly treating Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty as interest rate cuts begin in Canada and Europe. \nThis institutional embrace is why Bitcoin ETFs have quickly ballooned despite launching just months ago. If current momentum sustains, more and more institutional money seem poised to flood the Bitcoin market.",
