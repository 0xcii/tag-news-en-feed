Zhu received a four-month prison sentence for failing to cooperate in the bankruptcy proceedings, Teneo revealed.\n \nCrackdown at Changi Airport: 3AC’s Su Zhu Detained, Associate Kyle Davies Fugitive\n \nTeneo, overseeing the liquidation of Three Arrows Capital, reported that co-founder Su Zhu was seized and sentenced to four months’ incarceration. His associate, Kyle Davies, remains at large; however, Teneo confirmed he was given an identical penalty.\n \nZhu allegedly tried to flee Singapore when he was intercepted at Changi Airport, situated approximately 25 miles east of Singapore’s Downtown Core. The Singapore court decreed that Zhu and Davies had not been collaborating with the liquidation procedure – an issue previously reported by the media months prior to his apprehension.\n \n \nThe defunct Singapore-based cryptocurrency hedge fund once supervised over $10 billion in assets at its height. However, a confluence of perilous trading tactics, Terra’s collapse, and plummeting cryptocurrency values obliterated the firm’s assets. Consequently, 3AC declared bankruptcy and was mandated to liquidate by a British Virgin Islands court on June 27, 2022.\n \nSquawk Box posted on X that Kyle Davies, the co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, was asked if he was in Bali because Indonesia is one of seven countries that will not extradite him to the United States. While that interview was in November 2022, Davies is believed to be still in Bali.\n \nWhat do you think about the 3AC co-founder’s arrest?

Bullish sentiment returned to end the week, with the global market cap trading nearly 1.5% higher as of writing. Solana also surged, moving back above the $20.00 mark.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was one of today’s biggest movers, climbing by as much as 5% earlier in the day.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.5036 yesterday, XRP/USD raced to a peak of $0.5455 during Friday’s session.\n \nThis resulted in the token hitting its highest point since August 29, which is the last time price hit a ceiling of $0.5490.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it appears that the move came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose beyond a ceiling of its own at 56.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 58.67, with the next visible point of support near the 60.00 mark.\n \nIn the event the 60.00 ceiling is broken, there is a good chance that XRP will climb beyond $0.5500.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nIn addition to XRP, solana (SOL) also rallied strongly on Friday, rising above $20.00 in the process.\n \nSOL/USD climbed to a high of $20.32 earlier in today’s session, following Thursday’s low at $19.22.\n \nThis surge has seen solana hit a nine-day high, which comes after three straight days of bullish momentum.\n \n \nOverall, the uptrend comes as the 10-day (red) moving average rose above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nBulls are likely now targeting a higher resistance level of $21.00, which would result in a four-week high.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould solana hit $21.00 this weekend?
