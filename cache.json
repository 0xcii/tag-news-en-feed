The bank partnered with Deutsche Börse-owned Crypto Finance AG for brokerage services and developed its own custody solution.\nThe move reflects the country's openness to Bitcoin, and cements ZKB as one of the largest mainstream financial institutions to embrace Bitcoin. Switzerland has taken a relatively positive stance on Bitcoin and crypto, including the Swiss National Bank, revealing it held shares in MicroStrategy.\nThe launch comes as more major financial players adopt Bitcoin and crypto offerings amid Bitcoin's surge in legitimacy. In the U.S., the successful debut of Bitcoin ETFs has accelerated institutional adoption. ZKB's move may pressure other Swiss and European banks to provide Bitcoin services.\nBanks worldwide, such as Hong Kong's Futu and Standard Chartered's Mox, have also recently launched Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs trading. This growing trend shows that traditional finance is increasingly embracing Bitcoin.",
