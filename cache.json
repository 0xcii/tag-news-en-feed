According to Bloomberg data, BlackRock's ETF attracted a record $612 million of inflows in a single day yesterday.\nDespite the success of Bitcoin ETFs, Saade emphasized that BlackRock's launch in Brazil and the United States does not constitute an endorsement of Bitcoin itself but rather a recognition of its relevance as an asset class. “Our goal is to serve our customers with safe and transparent products. We have no recommendation or any expectations regarding Bitcoin itself,” Saade explained.",
