After days of uncertainty, sentiment shifted in crypto markets, with a red wave washing away recent bulls. Bitcoin also dropped below $23,000 as a result of today’s sell-off.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) fell below the $23,000 level on Wednesday, as a red wave swept through cryptocurrency markets.\n \nFollowing a high of $23,048.18 on Tuesday, BTC/USD hit an intraday low of $22,406.08 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of today’s drop in price, bitcoin fell to its weakest point since Sunday, breaking out of a floor at $22,500 in the process.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the drop came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell to its lowest level since last Thursday.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at a level of 79.93, which comes less than 24 hours after hovering at 85.09.\n \nSince its earlier breakout, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has somewhat rebounded, and is currently trading at $22,614.62.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nSentiment in ethereum (ETH) also shifted on Wednesday, with prices falling below a recent support point at $1,600.\n \nETH/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,530.80 on Wednesday, following a peak of $1,630.47 during Tuesday’s session.\n \nSince breaking out of its $1,600 floor, ethereum appears to be heading towards a lower level of support at $1,500.\n \n \nLike with bitcoin, today’s red wave comes as bears have finally opted to reenter the market, as a result of prices being overbought.\n \nEthereum’s 14-day RSI is currently sitting at 61.07, which is its lowest point since January 8, and this comes a day after breaking out of a floor at 74.00.\n \nThere appears to be an upcoming support area at 58.00, and if this remains firm, ETH could manage to stay above $1,500.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould we see cryptocurrencies continue to fall in the coming days?

Then, within a year, it capitulated. While mainstream news commentators were quick to pick through the reasons for why Kazakh authorities turned against Bitcoin mining operations, the consequence this had on the greening of the network went unreported.\nBut because Kazakhstan is fuelled 87.6% by fossil fuel, less mining there means a higher clean energy mix for the Bitcoin network. \nHow much higher? \nThat’s what I asked myself.
