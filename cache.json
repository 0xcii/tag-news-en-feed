The move followed Nigeria's recent ban  \non several cryptocurrency trading websites to address the rapid devaluation of  \nthe naira and soaring inflation rates.\nCryptocurrency Crackdown in Nigeria\nNigeria's crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges  \nstems from concerns over the devaluation of the naira, which has contributed to  \nrecord-high inflation rates nearing 30%. \nCryptocurrency websites have reportedly become an  \nalternative platform for trading and establishing unofficial exchange rates for  \nthe naira exchange rates. This has prompted Nigerian authorities to take action  \nagainst them.\nThe executives traveled to Nigeria following the ban  \non cryptocurrency trading websites but were detained upon arrival by the office  \nof the country's national security adviser. Consequently, Binance suspended naira trading  \nagainst bitcoin and tether digital coins on its platform. According to the FT,  \nthe Nigerian authorities seized the executives' passports.\nGovernment's Concerns and Investigation\nNigeria's central bank governor, Olayemi Cardoso,  \nexpressed concerns about illicit financial flows through cryptocurrency  \nexchanges, citing $26 billion passing through Binance Nigeria in one year. The  \ngovernment, including anti-corruption agencies and the police, is coordinating  \nan investigation into cryptocurrency exchanges. \n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.",
