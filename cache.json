He said in an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt Sunday without giving a specific timeframe:\n \n\nA payment option with bitcoin is coming.\n \nRisch explained that Liechtenstein plans to accept bitcoin and immediately exchange BTC for Swiss francs, the national currency, in order to avoid exchange-rate risks. He also clarified that the cryptocurrency would not be granted equal status as the Swiss franc.\n \nThe prime minister additionally told the news outlet that he was open to investing state reserves in bitcoin in the future.\n \n \nLiechtenstein’s reserves, currently amounting to approximately 2.23 billion Swiss francs ($2.51 billion), are invested mostly in securities, Handelsblatt reported, citing the finance ministry.\n \nRisch was further quoted by Reuters as saying:\n \n\nCryptocurrencies like bitcoin are still too risky. But this assessment can of course change.\n \nIn October 2019, Liechtenstein’s legislature approved the “Token and Trustworthy Technology Service Providers Act” (abbreviated TVTG in German). The government noted in its announcement at the time that with the new law, Liechtenstein becomes the first country to comprehensively regulate the token economy.\n \nWhat is your opinion regarding the plan of Liechtenstein’s government to accept bitcoin payments and the possibility of investing reserves in bitcoin?
