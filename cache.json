His lawyers say the FTC is not entitled to monetary relief and cannot substantiate Mashinsky is currently violating the law.\n \nMashinsky Fights Back: Former Celsius CEO Challenges FTC Lawsuit, Claims No Legal Violations\n \nIn a memorandum filed September 11, 2023, Mashinsky’s legal team asserts the FTC complaint does not show he breached the Federal Trade Commission Act. His lawyers claim the FTC cannot seek monetary damages under the Act per a 2021 Supreme Court ruling.\n \n“The complaint cannot substantiate a claim that Mashinsky ‘is violating’ or is ‘about to violate’ the law because Mashinsky resigned from his position as CEO of Celsius [on] September 27, 2023,” the court filing reads.\n \nThe memorandum states the FTC’s allegations fail to support that Mashinsky knowingly made false statements to deceptively obtain customer data. This purportedly does not meet the requirements to allege a violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Mashinsky’s lawyers also contend the FTC has not demonstrated grounds for monetary relief under the Act.\n \n \nIn their filing, Mashinsky’s attorneys ask the court to dismiss the FTC’s Federal Trade Commission Act and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act claims against him. They argue the complaint does not establish that Mashinsky broke any laws or regulations. When he was officially charged by the FTC, Mashinsky “vehemently” denied the allegations.\n \nWhat do you think about the motion to dismiss filing submitted by Alex Mashinsky’s legal team?

          "description": "On-chain data from Glassnode suggests that 83.7% of the Bitcoin short-term holder supply is currently being held at an unrealized loss.\n \nBitcoin Short-Term Holder Supply Has Plummeted Into Losses\n \nAccording to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, only 16.3% of the short-term holder supply is in profit right now. The relevant indicator here is the “percent supply in profit,” which measures the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply carrying some gains.\n \nThis metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved/transferred at.

          "description": "Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has warned that it is “a huge mistake” to think that the U.S. economy will boom “for years” given that there are so many risks out there. The executive stressed: “I just think people make a mistake to look at real-time numbers and not look at the future. And the future has quantitative tightening. We’ve been spending money like drunken sailors around the world.”\n \nJamie Dimon’s Economic Warning\n \nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned about where the U.S. economy is headed at the Barclays 21st Annual Global Financial Services Conference in New York on Monday.\n \nThe executive cautioned: “I just think people make a mistake to look at real-time numbers and not look at the future. And the future has quantitative tightening. We’ve been spending money like drunken sailors around the world, this war in Ukraine is still going on.” Dimon emphasized:\n \n\nTo say the consumer is strong today, meaning you are going to have a booming environment for years, is a huge mistake.\n \n“If and when you have a recession, which you’re eventually going to have, you’ll have a normal credit cycle, which I think is quite predictable. In a normal credit cycle, something always does worse than normal,” he described.\n \nThe JPMorgan boss opined: “There’s a lot of fiscal stimulus taking place out there. And the large one from Covid is still running through. The largest QE is still running through. So we’re still living on that, and that’s really strong. And of course, that drives everything, including business results.”\n \n \nDimon further explained that “businesses feel pretty good because they look at their current results” and see that “they’re not so bad.” However, he cautioned:\n \n\nBut those things change. And we don’t know what the full effect of all these things are going to be 12 or 18 months from now.\n \nDo you agree with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon? Let us know in the comments section below.",
