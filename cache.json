This new update aims to make the transfer of funds as effortless as sending a text.\n \nCoinbase Unveils Link-Based Money Transfer Service\n \nCoinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) has launched its latest wallet feature that facilitates global fund transfers. The platform now allows users to transfer money across various channels, including widely used messaging and social media apps, by merely sharing a link.\n \nAnnounced on Tuesday, Coinbase explained this feature circumvents the need for intricate banking details and expensive wire transactions, offering immediate settlements without charge. The update includes compatibility with various social media and messaging applications such as Whatsapp, Instagram, Tiktok, Facebook, Telegram, Snapchat, and also via email.\n \nIn essence, the service functions on any platform capable of sharing a link. Coinbase clarified that if the recipient does not claim the funds within two weeks, they automatically revert to the sender. Coinbase’s new payment method is akin to those provided by major payment corporations like Paypal and Stripe.\n \n \nPaypal facilitates link-based transactions through a service named Paypal.me. In this service, individuals can generate a personalized link to solicit payments directly to their Paypal account. Paypal’s feature can be used for crypto payments associated with the select digital assets it supports.\n \nTargeting both novices and seasoned users, Coinbase has also rolled out a ‘simple mode’ in its non-custodial wallet. This feature concentrates on core functionalities such as purchasing, sending, receiving, and safeguarding digital currencies.\n \nWhat do you think about the new feature added to Coinbase’s non-custodial wallet service?

The renowned banking executive stated that if he held a position in the government, he would \"close down\" Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nDimon, who has been historically critical about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, reiterated his concerns regarding how the assets can be used. He emphasized that the government has the power to enforce strict regulations or even shut down the entire crypto space.\n\"I've always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc,\" said Dimon. \"The true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, anti-money laundering, tax avoidance. And that is a use case.\" \nDimon's stance echoes his previous sentiments regarding Bitcoin, as he once labeled it a \"fraud\" and warned investors about its speculative nature. However, he has also acknowledged the underlying technology, blockchain, as having potential applications in various industries.\n\"It is some what anonymous, not fully. And because you can move money instantaneously because it doesn't go through know you customer, sanctions, OFAC — they can bypass all of that,\" Dimon continued. \"If I were the government I'd close it down.\"\nBitcoin has faced criticism from several influential financial figures such as Dimon due to its decentralized nature and perceived risks. It is important to note that while the government could be hostile towards the industry working in the United States, no government could close down the decentralized Bitcoin network.",

          "description": "DMG Blockchain Solutions, a bitcoin miner and cryptocurrency technology company, announced that the firm has purchased 4,550 T21 Antminer bitcoin miners from Bitmain Technologies. DMG detailed that it paid $12.1 million for the next-generation application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners which equates to $14 per terahash a second (TH/s).\n \nDMG to Expand Fleet With Latest Purchase From Bitmain\n \nDMG has revealed it has purchased 4,550 T21 Antminers from Bitmain and it expects to get 1.06 exahash per second (EH/s) from the new units. The firm detailed that the miners cost $12.1 million and were financed through both cash and liquidated bitcoin (BTC). The mining firm is expecting the units to arrive sometime in March 2024.\n \nThe T21 Antminer produces 190 TH/s but can be overclocked to 233 TH/s, DMG detailed in its announcement. The company aims to ship the miners to the firm’s Christina Lake data center facility. “DMG is planning to utilize its previously purchased mining containers, which are in the process of being installed at its Christina Lake facility in advance of taking delivery of the T21 miners,” the company said in a statement.\n \n\n \nDMG added:\n \n\nThis new fleet, in combination with expected rationalization of its existing fleet, will help DMG improve its overall fleet efficiency anticipated to be below 25 J/TH post-halvening, which is expected in April 2024.\n \nThe news follows several mining operations acquiring ASIC bitcoin mining machines. Iris Energy just recently acquired 7,000 T21 Antminers from Bitmain and Riot Platforms secured 66,560 ASICs or 18 EH/s from Microbt. DMG mined 64.7 BTC in November and by the end of the month, the firm held a total of 429 BTC worth $18,801,182 using prevailing exchange rates.\n \nWhat do you think about DMG’s latest purchase? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",

          "description": "Satoshi Nakamoto is God and Bitcoin’s design is perfect. Or is it? There's one feature of the protocol that keeps bugging me: the Halvening (halving, whatever). I'm sure Naka thought this over. His first Bitcoin must have had an incremental reduction of the supply per block. But the final design, the one we know, cuts the block reward in half only after every 210,000 blocks (every four years). Obviously, this decision had a tremendous impact on price action, volatility, and adoption. Unfortunately, it’s not the best supply scheme. Let's explore.\nHalvings\nBitcoin, as we know it, has a supply schedule adhering to the following hard coded rule:\n \n         \n         \n         \n        The mathematical formula of the supply decrease. \n    \nFor the non-mathies, this is the sum (Σ) of all the new…",
