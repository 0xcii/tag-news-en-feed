A UK judge has ruled that Wright must pay £400,000 ($516,000) in security for legal costs to continue his case against the exchanges.\n \nCraig Wright has long asserted that he is the mastermind behind Bitcoin. However, the authenticity of his claim remains hotly contested within the community. Despite previous lawsuits seeking copyright to the BTC white paper, no court has definitively established Wright as the true creator of Bitcoin. Why?

This development coincides with the \"Nixon shock\" of August 15, 1971, when U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would end the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold. \nSince then, central banks around the world have started operating a fiat-based monetary system with floating exchange rates and no real currency standard at all.
