          "description": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised concerns over the recent surge of applications for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stating that the filings are lacking clarity and comprehensive information, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nA variety of firms have submitted the applications such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments. \nFollowing BlackRock's lead, a wave of traditional and crypto asset managers, including Fidelity Investments, Ark Investment Management, Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise Asset Management, and Valkyrie, have reactivated or amended their applications for spot bitcoin ETFs in recent days. The approval of such an ETF would mark a significant milestone for the industry, providing broader institutional access to bitcoin and allowing investors to trade bitcoin as easily as stocks, albeit at the loss of some of bitcoin’s properties.\nExperts predicted BlackRock's application would address the SEC's concerns through an agreement to share surveillance of a spot bitcoin-trading platform with Nasdaq, the proposed ETF's listing exchange.\nNevertheless, the SEC informed the exchanges that the filings lacked key details, such as the precise surveillance-sharing agreement that would be implemented. A spokesperson for Cboe told the Wall Street Journal that they plan to update and refile the application. \nThe SEC's critique has once again highlighted the regulatory challenges surrounding the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs. Market participants await updates from the asset managers and exchanges to address the concerns raised by the SEC. As the industry eagerly anticipates the potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, stakeholders hope that the revised filings will provide the clarity and comprehensive information necessary to gain regulatory acceptance.",

Based on current estimates, the Litecoin halving will take place on August 3, 2023, 10:01 am UTC (6:01 am EST), ushering the “digital silver” into a new era.\n \nLitecoin Halving Is Just Around The Corner\n \nHere’s the deal with the halving. Miners in the network get rewarded with Litecoin for producing blocks. At the beginning, it was 50 LTC per block. But every 4 years or so (around 840,000 blocks), that reward gets cut in half. Currently at 12.5 LTC, it will drop to 6.25 LTC after the August 2023 halving.\n \nLike Bitcoin, Litecoin was designed to be deflationary, like gold or silver. As time goes on, the number …",
