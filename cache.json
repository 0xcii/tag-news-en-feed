Many Bitcoiners start saving and not living paycheck to paycheck. Many start taking their lives more seriously and quit drinking alcohol and playing video games. Still others start investigating their diet and quit eating sugar, carbs, seed oils and other things they've been eating their whole lives. Some even get married and start having children. There are even some who start taking religion seriously.\nThese results are pretty puzzling. What does a digital money have to do with any of these things? Yet, to even ask this question is to ignore the environmen…",

At the time of writing this, the global market cap is trading 4.23% lower, with bears recapturing sentiment. Cardano was also on the decline, falling by as much as 8% today.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) prices plunged during today’s session, which comes as bears have seemingly recaptured market sentiment.\n \nFollowing a high of $22.90 on Thursday, SOL/USD moved to an intraday low at $20.20 earlier in the session.\n \nThis drop resulted in the token hitting its lowest point since January 19, when solana last collided with a floor at $20.00.\n \n \nSince hitting a peak of 87.67 on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) back on January 13, price strength has consistently declined.\n \nAs a result of this, the index is now tracking at 44.21, which is its weakest point since January 2 when SOL was under $10.00.\n \nUltimately, this has its positives, as longer-term bulls may see this as a sign that prices are gradually moving in the right direction.\n \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) extended its own recent sell-off on Friday, with prices falling for a third straight session.\n \nADA/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.3558 earlier today, which comes after prices peaked at $0.3896 on Thursday.\n \nAs a result of this drop, ADA slipped to its weakest point since January 25, breaking out of a floor at $0.3590 in the process.\n \n \nSince falling from this point of support, ADA has somewhat rallied, with bulls moving to buy the dip in price.\n \nThis took place as the RSI leveled out at a floor of 46.70, with cardano currently at $0.3611.\n \nIf this floor on the indicator continues to hold firm, there could be a rally over the week, with bulls re-entering the market.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect cardano rally once today’s sell-off has ceased?
