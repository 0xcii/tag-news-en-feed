The announcement discloses that Coinbase will follow rigorous risk management and compliance standards set by Bermuda regulators.\n \n \nThe move comes as other exchanges face increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States by regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase said its futures contracts have already seen over $5.5 billion in notional trading volume since launching earlier this year.\n \nThe San Francisco-based company said its futures trading services will only be available to eligible retail investors outside the U.S. after passing the company’s assessment checks. Coinbase said its futures accounts will be backed by usd coin (USDC) reserves and managed by an experienced risk team.\n \nWhat do you think about Coinbase rolling out perpetual futures after getting BMA approval?
