          "description": "The competition between Ripple and Ethereum has been a long-running one given the capabilities of both networks. This was further exacerbated by the fact that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chose to bring a lawsuit against Ripple over XRP being allegedly a security but the same was not done about Ethereum’s ETH token.\n \nBoth communities have since been at loggerheads with each one trying to prove that they’re better than the other. As a result of this, a video from 2014 has been dug up where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin seems to be praising Ripple.\n \n‘Ripple Is The Internet Of Value’\n \nIn the video that was posted by X (formerly Twitter) user @NerdNationUnbox, Buterin seems to be very convinced about the value proposition of Ripple.

          "description": "In the wake of fabricated news asserting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lit Blackrock’s Ishares spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, short positions worth $78.92 million were cleared out. This sum represented 57% of the overall $136.29 million in short positions erased in the last 24 hours.\n \nMisleading Report on SEC Decision Shakes Bitcoin Market, Erasing Millions in Short Bets\n \nOn Monday, the crypto-focused media outlet Cointelegraph disseminated false information via social media platform X and its Telegram channel, triggering a more than 10% spike in bitcoin (BTC) value against the U.S. dollar.\n \nThe digital currency briefly touched $29,900 per coin before plunging to $28,100 per unit once the news was debunked. Cointelegraph, despite issuing an apology, was too late to prevent the market upheaval that resulted in the obliteration of $78.92 million worth of short positions.\n \n\n \nData from Coinglass reveals that in the past four hours, BTC short positions accounted for $71.36 million of the liquidated shorts. Around $2.49 million in Solana (SOL) short positions were also liquidated, among others.\n \nThe $78.92 million represented a staggering 57% of the day’s total short positions liquidated in the last 24 hours. In the same four-hour timeframe, long positions in Ethereum (ETH) exceeding $18 million were also liquidated.\n \n \nFollowing the exposure of the counterfeit news, short positions on Bitfinex dropped drastically. Concurrently, long positions on Bitfinex saw a surge before the false news was confirmed, but have since declined.\n \nThe fallacious news event led to a significant number of traders being liquidated, potentially deflating the speculation surrounding the actual decision. The most substantial liquidations came from BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, and SOL.\n \nWhat do you think about all the short traders who were wiped out over the fake news?
