He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

          "description": "In an announcement made on April 24, Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange with the largest trade volume, unveiled its latest staking product, wrapped beacon eth (WBETH). This new addition to Binance’s staking solutions is built on the Ethereum network, joining the ranks of other competing liquid staking products such as Lido, Coinbase, Rocket Pool, and Frax.\n \nWBETH Emerges as Binance’s New Solution to Ethereum-Based Staking\n \nLiquid staking products based on Ethereum have been gaining popularity over the past two years. According to defillama.com metrics, as of this writing, there are over 8.2 million ether worth $15.49 billion locked into liquid staking derivatives. A staggering 74.22% of these ether assets are held by Lido Finance, the current leader in this space.\n \nCoinbase’s wrapped ether product comes in second with $2.19 billion locked, followed by Rocket Pool with $983.26 million, Frax with $297.09 million, and Stakewise with $163.98 million. Binance has revealed that it has created two contracts for its new WBETH token, one for the Binance Smart Chain and one for Ethereum. The token will be available for trading on Binance from Thursday, with BUSD, ETH, and USDT trading pairs.\n \n \nStarting on April 27, 2023, users will be able to create WBETH by depositing 1 ether, and vice versa. “Each WBETH token will accrue ETH Staking rewards daily, in accordance with the daily APR on ETH Staking,” states Binance. Additionally, to “support the daily updates of the BETH/WBETH conversion rate, the ‘Wrap’ and ‘Unwrap’ functions will be temporarily paused each day” at a designated time.\n \nWhat do you think the future holds for liquid staking products, and how will the launch of WBETH impact the competitive landscape?

          "description": "Money is crucial to regulating our lives and economies. Here’s an essential guide to understanding money and its role in today’s economic system.\nIntroduction\nMoney is something that most of us take for granted, as we use it daily to buy goods and services. We constantly transact in money, think in money and strive to earn more of it. However, few genuinely understand what money is, and even those who do often perceive it in very different ways. \nSome say that money is a form of energy that can be transformed and exchanged. Others see it as a technological tool that facilitates trade and commerce. Still others argue that money is a social construct shaped and governed by cultural norms and values. All these views can be correct since the concept of money is much deeper than the way it is c…",

          "description": "Unit of Account\nUnit of account is the thing that measures the value of goods and services. It's an essential function for something to be [or become?] money. In simple terms, it is a standard measure of value, a common scaling system through which the value of products can be calculated and compared.\nCountries typically have distinct units of account, identified as the national or regional currency, such as the euro (EUR) or the British pound (GBP). At the same time, internationally, the U.S. dollar (USD) is the unit of account that is mainly used for global invoicing and setting prices internationally. \nUnit of account is one of money’s three universally agreed functions of money that Bitcoin Magazine is reviewing; the other two are store of value and medium of exchange.\nWhat is a Unit o…",

          "description": "Store of Value\nThe concept of a “store of value” refers to goods that are capable of retaining or increasing their worth over time rather than declining in value. This term is used to describe a mechanism that enables individuals to preserve their wealth without experiencing any loss in value over time. \nIt is one of the three functions of money that Bitcoin Magazine is exploring; the other two are medium of exchange and unit of account.\nWhat is a Store of Value\nA store of value is an asset, a currency or a commodity that can be trusted to hold its value over time; ideally, it doesn’t bear much risk. Traditionally, people who are less tolerant to risk will invest in a store of value with an enduring lifespan, a stable demand and low volatility. \nFiat currencies are weak stores of value sin…",

          "description": "Medium of Exchange\nAs society’s structure and organization became more complex over time, the need for an evolving monetary system arose from the limitations of barter. Barter is not suitable as a means to exchange goods and services in an economic system larger than a tribe or family; barter was unsuitable for expanding societies that needed a more efficient method to exchange goods and services. \nHence, about 2,600 years ago, a new and more sophisticated medium of exchange emerged in Lydia — a region recognized as modern Turkey — and materialized with stamped coins to face the challenges of barter and facilitate trade.\nA medium of exchange is an intermediary item that is widely accepted to facilitate the trade of goods and services between two parties.
