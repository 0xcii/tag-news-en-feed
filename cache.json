Naturally, to estimate the profits that these chain validators might be making, the cost of production that they incur needs to be known first.\n \nTo find this cost, the analytics firm has used its “difficulty regression model.” According to Glassnode, the model “is an estimated all-in-sustaining cost of production for Bitcoin (for the average miner).”\n \nAs its name may already imply, the model is based on the “mining difficulty” metric.

Although there is quite a bit of controversy in this field, the mainstream scientific consensus is that over-unity power generation is impossible, because it defies the first law of thermodynamics. \nAccording to this law, energy can undergo transformations from one form to another, but the total amount of energy within a closed system remains constant.
