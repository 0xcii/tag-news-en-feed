Ethereum also rose today, hitting a fresh multi-month high.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) rallied to a two-month high earlier in today’s session, as prices climbed above the $19,000 mark.\n \nFollowing a low of $17,995.20 on Thursday, BTC/USD moved to a peak of $19,031.80 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of the move, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed to its strongest point since November 8, when price was above $20,000.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the rally came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose to a peak of 82.00, which was its highest mark in over a year.\n \nIn addition to this, the upwards trend on the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages continued to mature, thus extending bullish momentum.\n \nDespite this, prices are now well beyond overbought, which could mean that bears are lurking and preparing for reentry.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nLike BTC, ethereum (ETH) also significantly rose on Friday, with price moving above the $1,400 mark.\n \nETH/USD hit an intraday high of $1,432.28 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after trading at a bottom of $1,378.42.\n \nAs with bitcoin, this spike in price has pushed ethereum to its highest point since November 8, when it hit a high of $1,580.\n \n \nFrom the chart, prices of ETH are now deep in overbought territory, with the RSI index tracking at a level of 75.54.\n \nEarlier gains have already begun to slip, as previous bulls have begun taking profits in anticipation of a reversal in momentum.\n \nAs of writing, ETH/USD is trading at $1,410.60.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould we see ETH hit $1,500 this weekend?
