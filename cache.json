The watchdog said it was concerned about the Seychelles-based crypto exchange's compliance with local regulatory requirements and the protection of  \ninvestors' interests. \nAccording to SC, Huobi's lack of registration as a Recognized Market Operator (RMO) violates the country's capital markets law.

The move comes despite current sentiment of uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market.
