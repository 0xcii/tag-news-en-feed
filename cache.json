Watkins also argued that the few games which did gain traction “relied on the allure of making money” which is not a sustainable model. \n \nWeb3 Gaming Not a Passing Fad\n \nHowever, in his written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, the Digital Arms CEO insisted that the industry’s focus has shifted back to making games with experiences and benefits which cannot be matched by traditional gaming.

          "description": "Bittrex US, the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, has recently introduced a plan that permits American customers to withdraw crypto and fiat from the platform, provided they satisfy the required regulatory criteria. This withdrawal arrangement was approved on Tuesday by the U.S. bankruptcy court located in Delaware.\n \nCryptocurrency Exchange Bittrex US Enables Customer Withdrawals\n \nOn May 8, 2023, Bittrex US filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing liabilities ranging from $500 million to $1 billion and having over 100,000 creditors. Before the bankruptcy filing, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had sued Bittrex for running an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency, and for listing unregistered crypto securities.\n \nBittrex sent emails to its U.S. customers this week, following approval from the U.S. bankruptcy court to enable withdrawals. However, there is a caveat: users must update their know-your-customer (KYC) information and agree to the latest terms of service. Bittrex asserts that this step is “necessary to comply with state and federal regulations.”\n \n \nWithdrawals opened on June 15, 2023, and the company has provided resources for identity verification, withdrawal instructions, and wire instructions. “Customers have until August 31, 2023, to withdraw any remaining funds,” Bittrex states. While cryptocurrency withdrawals are relatively simple, fiat withdrawals require the submission of an application to link a bank account. Additionally, there is a $25 wire fee for customers who choose to wire funds through Bittrex.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on Bittrex US allowing fund withdrawals for customers amidst its bankruptcy proceedings?

          "description": "On June 15, the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced that customers can now earn 4% rewards on the stablecoin USDC. The news follows Coinbase’s current dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the firm’s staking-as-a-service product.\n \nCoinbase Rolls Out 4% Stablecoin Rewards for Global Customers, Except Hawaii Residents\n \nCoinbase is now allowing users to earn 4% rewards by holding USDC on the centralized cryptocurrency trading platform, according to a Thursday announcement. “Grow your savings with a rewarding, secure digital dollar,” Coinbase announced. “Global Coinbase customers can now earn 4% rewards on USDC.” Coinbase explains that as little as $1 in USDC can be held on the exchange to earn rewards.\n \nCoinbase’s most recent USDC rewards service comes in the wake of the exchange being sued by the SEC. The complaint alleges that the firm “failed to register its staking-as-a-service program as required by securities laws.” Additionally, the Alabama securities regulator contends that Coinbase violated state securities regulations by “offering its staking rewards program accounts to Alabama residents without a registration to offer or sell these securities.”\n \n \nRegarding the recent USDC rewards service, Coinbase specifies that the annual percentage rate (APR) of 4% is subject to change. “The rewards rate is subject to change and can vary,” the exchange explained on Thursday. “Customers will be able to see the latest applicable rates directly within their accounts.”\n \nThe Coinbase rewards program is accessible in 71 countries, including the United States, but excludes residents of Hawaii. To participate, Coinbase customers must be verified at tier two, the exchange’s latest announcement concludes.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on Coinbase’s decision to offer 4% rewards on USDC amidst its ongoing dispute with the SEC? We’d love to hear your perspective in the comments section below.",

          "description": "According to a Fortune report published on June 16, the cryptocurrency asset platform Bakkt is delisting three cryptocurrencies due to the current regulatory climate. Bakkt’s general counsel stated that the platform will expand its coin offering once there is “further clarity.”\n \nBakkt Reacts to Regulatory Pressure, Delists Solana, Polygon, and Cardano\n \nBakkt, the New York-based digital asset platform, revealed Friday that it is delisting solana (SOL), polygon (MATIC), and cardano (ADA). The move comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intensifies its scrutiny of cryptocurrency platforms and designates certain assets as unregistered securities.\n \nThe announcement of Bakkt’s delisting of SOL, MATIC, and ADA was made by the company’s general counsel and secretary, Marc D’Annunzio, in an interview with Fortune. D’Annunzio stated that the proactive removal would continue “until there is further clarity on how to compliantly offer a more extensive list of coins.”\n \nPrior to Bakkt’s decision, the digital trading platform Robinhood has chosen to delist cardano (ADA), solana (SOL), and polygon (MATIC). Similarly, Tel Aviv-based Etoro has announced the delisting of ALGO, MANA, DASH, and MATIC for U.S. customers, citing the same reasons. Both Robinhood and Etoro said the firms are implementing proactive measures until regulatory clarity is established in the United States.\n \n \nAll the tokens that were previously listed on Bakkt, Robinhood, and Etoro and subsequently delisted have been classified as unregistered securities by the U.S. SEC. The SEC’s enforcement lawsuits also identify XRP, TON, OMG, POWR, BTT, KIN, TRX, MIR, EMAX, ALGO, and IHT, among others, as securities.\n \nAre the recent delistings by Bakkt, Robinhood, and Etoro a necessary step towards regulatory compliance, or do they hinder innovation in the cryptocurrency space?

Bitcoin has moved below $25,000 for the first time since March, as the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued both Binance and Coinbase. The Federal Reserve has also paused its rate hike policy, with traders still unsure of what this could mean for markets.\n \nCurrent Market Status\n \nThe action taken by the SEC earlier this month has been the main source of bearishness, with the regulator moving to crack down on operators in the space.\n \nFollowing this, inflation in the United States fell to lower than expected, coming in at a low of 4%, briefly boosting the U.S. dollar.\n \nHowever, with the Fed opting to keep rates unchanged for now, market uncertainty has heightened, with traders processing the potential long-term impacts of tighter monetary policy.\n \nJune Outlook\n \nBitcoin (BTC) rose back above $25,000 on Friday, as traders moved to buy the recent dip in price.\n \nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency plunged to its weakest point since March 16 earlier this week, triggered by the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision.\n \nBulls that have returned to BTC in recent days would have done so due to prices being oversold, with the relative strength index (RSI) hovering below the 30.00 mark.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the index has now broken out of a ceiling at 43.00, and is tracking at 43.26, which has prompted a rise in momentum.\n \nThe next visible point of resistance is at the 50.00 mark, and 57.00 thereafter. Should bulls move beyond both of these, BTC will likely be trading above $27,500 in the next few weeks.\n \nWhere will bitcoin end the month? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.",
