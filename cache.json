          "description": "Avalanche was one of Thursday’s big gainers, as the token rose by as much as 22% in today’s session. The move came as inflation in the United States fell to 6.5% as markets were expecting. Polkadot was another notable mover, with prices climbing close to a four-week high. \n \nAvalanche (AVAX)\n \nAvalanche (AVAX) rose by as much as 22% in today’s session, as cryptocurrencies reacted to the latest U.S. inflation report.\n \nAVAX/USD moved to a peak of $16.11 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a bottom of $12.41.\n \nThursday’s spike in price pushed avalanche to its highest point since November 8, when price was at a peak of $18.15.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, earlier gains have somewhat eased, with AVAX now trading at $15.18.\n \nThis came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failed to break out from a resistance at the 80.00 level.\n \nAs of writing, the index is now tracking at 69.94, which is still deep in overbought territory.\n \n \nPolkadot (DOT)\n \nPolkadot (DOT), was another big gainer in today’s session, with prices moving closer towards a four-week high.\n \nFollowing a low of $4.84, DOT/USD managed to reach an intraday high of $5.16 earlier on Thursday.\n \nAs a result of this move, DOT broke out of a key resistance level of $5.15, hitting its strongest point since December 16 in the process.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, the 14-day RSI has failed to move beyond its long-term ceiling of 68.00, and has since slipped lower.\n \nPrice strength is now tracking at 63.10, with DOT declining from its earlier peak, and the asset is trading at $5.09.\n \nIn order for the token to continue to move higher, there will first need to be a rally above its 68.00 point on the RSI.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill we see a reversal in polkadot now that price is overbought?

This was decided by today’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) release in the US at 8:30 am EST.\n \nThe baseline was relatively clear. Most estimates agreed that 6.5% is the magic line that will decide whether it is a bull or bear market in the short term. If the figure is 6.3% or lower, there will be a bull run as the US central bank projections from the last FOMC are no longer credible and will be thrown overboard.\n \nAt 6.3% to 6.5%, the market is likely to celebrate with restraint, although this may already be priced in.
