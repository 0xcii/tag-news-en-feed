The commission previously alleged that CEO Brad Garlinghouse and chairman Chris Larsen had violated securities laws. Solana also surged, rising by over 10% today.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP rose to a two-week high on Friday, following a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to drop its case against Garlinghouse and Larsen.\n \nXRP/USD peaked at $0.5291 earlier in the day, which comes following a low at $0.4831 the day prior.\n \nAs a result of today’s high, ripple rose to its highest point since October 5, when price peaked at $0.5325.\n \n \nEarlier gains have now eased, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to move beyond a ceiling at 57.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 56.32, with the next visible floor at the 50.00 level.\n \nThe 10-day (red) moving average has also begun to trend upwards, increasing chances of an upwards crossover in the upcoming days.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) surged significantly higher in today’s session, after finally breaking its long-term ceiling at $25.00.\n \nAfter trading at a bottom of $24.17 on Thursday, SOL/USD jumped to an intraday high of $27.29 earlier today.\n \nFriday’s move is the highest point that solana has hit since July 20, when price peaked at $27.35.\n \n \nAs a result of this strong sentiment, SOL has risen into overbought territory, with the RSI climbing to a current reading of 74.60.\n \nA point of resistance now awaits current bulls at the 75.00 mark, and should they prevail, solana could capture $28.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill solana bulls begin to take profits this weekend?

However, as much as easier development is necessary, it's important to build in a way that protects user security and privacy by default. For example, how a light wallet connects to a third-party server to receive and send transaction data is an important issue to address.\nI believe that bitcoin wallets need block filters to respect a user's privacy. Why? It's the only way to keep data from leaking to the server, which would allow it to link a user's transaction data beyond what is publicly available. \nIn this article, we will explore why bitcoin wallets need block filters by first looking at how many bitcoin users run full nodes, how API wallets offer good user experience but ul…",
