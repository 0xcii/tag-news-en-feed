The latest trend in Ireland’s fraud landscape signifies a significant shift in focus, with scammers now setting their sights on traditional banking customers. \n \nThis pivot, as reported by the Irish Independent, comes in the wake of a substantial dip in the frequency of cryptocurrency scams. While the crypto market has endured a prolonged bear run, the traditional banking sector has become the prime hunting ground for these illicit actors, resulting in a staggering loss of nearly 20 million euros ($21.8 million) to banking-related scams in 2023 alone.\n \n \nCrypto Scammers’ Changing Tactics\n \nThe modus operandi employed by these fraudsters often involves duplicitous calls or deceptive emails, wherein the perp…",

          "description": "On October 16, 2023, Bitcoin’s difficulty impressively crossed the 61 trillion mark at block height 812,448, setting a fresh benchmark for the network. This ascent marked the fourth-largest rise in difficulty for the year. Yet, in the face of this increase, the hashrate has steadily and unflinchingly risen.\n \nBitcoin’s Difficulty Explodes to 61 Trillion, Hashrate Unyieldingly Marches Onward\n \nOn the heels of a 6.47% leap on Monday, Bitcoin’s difficulty peaked at an unprecedented 61.03 trillion, signifying the year’s fourth most significant spike. Miners previously navigated two back-to-back hikes: a 5.48% rise on September 19, followed by a slight 0.35% nudge upward on October 3.\n \nYet, despite these challenges, the hashrate is approaching its zenith, closely mirroring the high seen on October 12, 2023. By Tuesday, October 17, post the 6.47% surge in difficulty, the hashrate gracefully sails at 444 exahash per second (EH/s).\n \n\n \nAbout 42 mining coalitions are pouring their hashrate into the Bitcoin chain, with the top five being Foundry USA, Antpool, Viabtc, F2pool, and Binance Pool. Over the last three days, Foundry has taken the lead, contributing 133.25 EH/s or 30.15% of the overall network’s hashrate, while Antpool churned out 116.95 EH/s, constituting 26.46% of the collective hashrate.\n \n \nCome October 29, 2023, the next anticipated shift in difficulty is set to roll out after over 1,800 blocks are discovered. Notably, block intervals have consistently fallen short of the typical ten-minute mark, ranging between 9 minutes and 13 seconds and 9 minutes and 37 seconds.\n \nThe current block times suggest (unless things change) that if the hashrate persists in its vigor and block durations linger below the ten-minute threshold, we might see another hike. Projections currently hint at a potential increase anywhere between 0.18% to 4.2%.\n \nWhat do you think about Bitcoin’s latest difficulty increase?

Sales, which account for two thirds of the U.S. economy, rose by 0.7% in September, 0.4% higher than expected. Ethereum briefly rose above $1,600.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin continued to trade above $28,000 on Tuesday, following a better than expected increase in U.S. retail sales.\n \nDespite slipping from a peak of $30,000 on Monday, BTC/USD traded above $28,600 in today’s session.\n \nAlthough gains have eased, this was still considerably higher than yesterday’s low at the $27,855.21 level.\n \n \nOverall, the recent upward trend means bitcoin is trading at its highest rate since August 18, which comes after the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a key resistance level.\n \nThe index surged beyond a ceiling at 63.00 in yesterday’s session, peaking above the 65.00 mark.\n \nPrice strength has since retreated, however is still marginally above the aforementioned point of resistance.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH), was lower in today’s session, after a brief stint trading above the $1,600 mark for the first time in almost ten days.\n \nETH/USD peaked at $1,628.16 to start the week, on the back of a tweet from Cointelegraph that suggested Blackrock’s spot bitcoin ETF was approved.\n \nAfter these claims were proven to be incorrect, the cryptocurrency has since slipped, falling to a low at $1,570.89 earlier today.\n \n \nAs a result of Tuesday’s decline, bears have snapped a four-day win streak, and could now be targeting a floor at $1,540.\n \nFrom the chart, it appears that a failure to move beyond a ceiling at 49.00 on the RSI indicator also contributed to today’s decline.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect momentum to now shift in favor of sellers?
