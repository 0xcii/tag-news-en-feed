          "description": "The mining firm will nearly double its existing infrastructure, adding up to 50 Megawatts to the 36 Megawatts already in use.\nBitcoin mining firm CleanSpark has announced the start of construction on a site in Washington, Georgia, set to house 16,000 miners, which could bring the company’s hash rate total to as high as 8.7 EH/s.\nThe site, which CleanSpark announced the acquisition of in 2022, would contribute to an additional 2.2 EH/s of hash rate for the company. The expansion is estimated to cost nearly $16 million according to the press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.\n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \n“The mining machine fleet at the new phase will consist of Antminer S19j Pro and Antminer S19 XP models, the newest and most power-efficient models of bitcoin mining machines available today,” states the release. \n“When we purchased the Washington site in August, we were confident about our ability to quickly expand, adding this 50MW to the existing 36MW of infrastructure,” Zach Bradford, CleanSpark’s CEO commented. “This second phase more than doubles the size of the existing operation. We are looking forward to expanding our relationship with the Washington City community and to be able to support the construction jobs that will come with this expansion.”\n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \nScott Garrison, vice president of business development at the firm, highlighted how the site “uses mainly low-carbon sources of power, employs newest generation tech, and is among the most power-efficient and sustainable bitcoin mining operations.” \nDespite the recent wider downturn in the mining industry, CleanSpark has seen a remarkable expansion from just 2.1 EH/s in January 2022, to 6.2 EH/s in December 2022. This expansion, alongside another site buildout in Sandersville, Georgia, is set to continue that rapid growth in the coming year.",

Bitcoin also declined in today’s session, with prices falling below the $21,000 mark.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $21,000 mark on Thursday, as crypto markets fell following slowing U.S. retail sales figures.\n \nThe decline saw BTC/USD hit an intraday low of $20,541.54 earlier in today’s session, fresh from a four-month high of $21,564.50.\n \nSince the sell-off, BTC now seems to be in search of a support point, with the $20,500 mark a likely candidate.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, a drop was somewhat expected with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) tracking near a two-year high in recent days.\n \nAs of writing, the index is at the 78.40 level, which is marginally above a floor at the 77.00 mark.\n \nShould a move below this point take place, it is likely that BTC bears could push prices towards the $20,000 zone.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH), which rose above $1,600 on Wednesday, was also in the red in today’s session, falling towards a five-day low.\n \nFollowing a high of $1,602.11 on hump-day, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,509.42 earlier today.\n \nAs a result of the move, ETH fell to its lowest point since Saturday, when prices hit a floor of $1,449.\n \n \nFrom the chart, ETH’s price strength has also hit a support level, with the RSI currently hovering close to a floor at 70.00.\n \nShould momentum continue to trend downwards, the next signal will be that of the 10-day (red) moving average, which for now remains upward facing.\n \nProviding this occurs, ethereum sellers will likely be targeting a move near the $1,350 mark.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould we see ethereum and bitcoin extend declines in the coming days?
