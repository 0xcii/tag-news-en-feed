          "description": "The newly listed cryptocurrency SEI took a substantial hit after its debut, plummeting over 65% from its peak value in just three days. The coin’s latest 13% tumble mirrored a decline in the broader crypto market in the last 24 hours. \n \nNew L1 Token Plummets 65% From Record High\n \nEnter SEI, the latest entrant in the L1 blockchain realm tailored for trading. By Friday, this newly launched token hovered between $0.15 and $0.184 apiece. Touted by the team as one of the swiftest L1 networks, SEI claims a transaction finality of a mere half-second, processing 20,000 orders per second.\n \nSEI’s documentation highlights its distinctive “Twin-turbo consensus”, designed for optimal efficiency. Developers note that SEI is among the few chains that adopt market-based parallelization. Moreover, SEI’s network offers an in-built exchange matching engine and protection against frontrunning, addressing common vulnerabilities in rival ecosystems. So far, however, SEI’s market performance has been lackluster.\n \n \nAlthough SEI has been in the trading game for a scant three days, it’s already plunged 65.71% from its record high on August 16, 2023. Touching $0.15 on Friday marked its lowest valuation yet. With a market cap hovering around $279.51 million, SEI occupies the 115th slot among over 10,000 crypto assets, joining the ranks of other hyped L1 debuts like aptos (APT) and sui (SUI).\n \n \nAPT, holding the 38th rank among the 10,000+ coins, has descended 71.07% from its zenith on January 26, 2023. Yet, it rose 87.13% from its lowest point on December 29, 2022. On the other hand, SUI, another newly launched L1 contender, has fallen 78.10% from its top price reached on May 03, 2023, hitting its lowest value on August 17, 2023.\n \nWhat do you think about SEI’s market performance over the last three days?

          "description": "For the first time in months, the entire list of top ten stablecoin assets has experienced supply shrinkage in the last 30 days. The stablecoin market now stands at $124 billion, following notable reductions across several projects. Yet, stablecoins still dominate in terms of global trade volume, accounting for 61% of all settled trades in the past day.\n \nTop 10 Stablecoin Supplies Drop Lower in 30 Days; FDUSD’s Supply Jumps 23% Higher\n \nEach of the ten premier stablecoins by market value has observed a decrease in supply. Notably, tether (USDT) experienced a 1.3% dip in its circulation over the recent month. USDC’s supply has diminished by 3%, and Makerdao’s DAI took a 7.6% hit.\n \nThe Paxos-backed BUSD now hovers slightly above 3 billion, shedding 15.7% of its circulating supply since the same period last month. Meanwhile, trueusd (TUSD) and Frax’s FRAX supply lessened by 1% and a whopping 19.8%, respectively.\n \nBoth USDD and USDP underwent reductions ranging from 1.2% to 10.1%. Concurrently, gemini dollar (GUSD) saw a sharp 36% drop this month, while liquity usd (LUSD) decreased by 1.4% in a month.\n \nIn contrast, the freshly introduced stablecoin, FDUSD, has expanded its supply significantly. On August 3, 2023, Bitcoin.com News highlighted FDUSD’s supply at 232 million, and now it’s around 287 million.\n \n \nThis indicates that in the last 15 days, FDUSD’s supply surged by 23.7%, even as most of the top ten stablecoins faced significant withdrawals. Binance wallets predominantly hold FDUSD’s supply, with only 26 distinct holders as of August 18, 2023.\n \nWith 61% of today’s trades associated with stablecoins, the total value reaches $74.26 billion at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on this Friday. Out of this, tether (USDT) represents a staggering $52.73 billion, translating to 71% of the global stablecoin trade volume for the day.\n \nWhat do you think about the past 30 days of stablecoin action and the reductions within that time span?
