          "description": "At the halfway point of April, bitcoin has risen beyond the $31,000 point for the first time in ten months. This rise in bullish sentiment comes as global inflation continues to fall, with many expecting central banks to soon pivot from current policies of monetary tightening. \n \nCurrent Market Status\n \nApril started mostly with consolidation, as traders continued to digest the last month’s banking crash, and Federal Reserve 25 basis point rate hike.\n \nHowever, following the non-farm payrolls report, which dropped to 236,000 in March, down from 326,000 the month prior, bulls began to reenter the market.\n \nSince then, inflation data has also been released, with consumer prices in China falling to an eighteen-month low, which pushed bitcoin back above $30,000.\n \nIn the United States, prices have also dipped, falling to 5% in March, with retail sales, also edging lower.\n \n\n \nApril Outlook\n \nThese factors have so far helped bitcoin, and led to prices moving above $31,000 for the first time since last June.\n \nDuring last month’s outlook, BTC was trading at a low of $19,628.25 on March 10, and as of writing, BTC/USD has now moved to a high of $31,005.61 earlier today.\n \nOne of the catalysts for this move was a breakout, which took place on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).\n \n \nBulls moved past a ceiling at the 68.00 mark, moving deep into overbought territory, by hitting a peak at 72.44.\n \nIn January, the index rose to a high of 89.00, which means that despite being overbought, there could still be some further gains as the month progresses.\n \nHowever, should the RSI fall below its aforementioned support at 68.00, bears could begin to reappear.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhere will bitcoin end the month?

The product is designed for those who want exposure to bitcoin without the tradeoffs of full third-party custody, but who are not yet ready to take on the responsibility of full self-custody.\nAccording to the press release, Onramp's solution is also intended to address the limitations of existing Bitcoin fund vehicles, including single-point-of-failure custody, taxable events on withdrawal and lack of Bitcoin focus and education. \nThe trust will have a “Bitcoin-only focus with a commitment to education and advisory services to help clients excel during periods of volatility,” the press release describes.\nThe product will also offer segregated accounts with the ability to take possession of the underlying bitcoin without incurring a taxable event.",
