          "description": "Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

          "description": "Polkadot was one of Tuesday’s biggest movers, as the token dropped to a six-week low in today’s session. Prices fell for a long-term support point of $5.60, as the global crypto market cap was once again 1% lower today. Avalanche also hit a price floor on Tuesday.\n \nPolkadot (DOT)\n \nPolkadot (DOT) was down for a second straight session on Tuesday, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remained bearish.\n \nDOT/USD dropped to a low of $5.61 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $5.82.\n \nAs a result of the move, polkadot slipped to its weakest point since March 12, when price was trading at $5.47.\n \n \nToday’s decline saw DOT near a floor at $5.60, with bulls so far rejecting a breakout below this point.\n \nAt the time of writing, the token is trading at $5.68, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped from a floor of its own.\n \nThe index rebounded from a floor at 36.00, and as of writing, is tracking at 37.52.\n \n \nAvalanche (AVAX)\n \nIn addition to DOT, Avalanche (AVAX) was another notable mover on Tuesday, as the token fell to its own level of support.\n \nFollowing a high of $17.06 to start the week, AVAX/USD sunk to a bottom at $16.53 earlier today.\n \nTuesday’s decline saw bears attempt to take avalanche to a long-term price floor at $16.30, however they were unsuccessful, thus far.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, and similar to what occurred with DOT, the breakout was rejected as the RSI remained above a floor of 41.00.\n \nAs of writing, price strength is tracking at 41.27, with a ceiling of 43.00 a possible target for bulls looking to extend the current rebound.\n \nShould this occur, there is a chance that AVAX could reach $17.00\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill avalanche climb above $17.00 this week?
