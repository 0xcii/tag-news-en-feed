          "description": "Coinbase Cloud and blockchain infrastructure company Kiln are now allowing ethereum (ETH) users to stake any amount of ether natively. The new offering removes the previous 32 ETH minimum staking requirement.\n \nStaking for All: Coinbase Cloud and Kiln Break Down Minimum Barriers\n \nWith the integration of Kiln’s onchain staking platform, Coinbase Cloud and its clients can enable partial ETH staking. This allows wallet providers like Coinbase Wallet to give users the ability to earn staking rewards without needing to meet minimums. The press announcement notes that over 99 percent of ether wallets hold less than the 32 ETH previously required to stake on the network.\n \n“We are thrilled to have worked with Coinbase Cloud and to welcome them as the first (non-Kiln) node operator leveraging the Kiln Onchain Staking Platform,” said Kiln CEO Laszlo Szabo. The Kiln CEO added:\n \n \nThis integration with Coinbase Cloud is unique because it allows them to enable other wallets and services, including [decentralized exchanges], with the same limitless [ether] staking solution that will be offered by Coinbase Wallet.\n \n \n \nPartial ETH staking builds on Coinbase Cloud’s existing staking infrastructure. The company said its multi-cloud, multi-region setup ensures reliability alongside trusted security standards. Coinbase further discloses that staking operations occur transparently onchain through audited smart contracts.\n \nCoinbase posits that by removing staking minimums, more individual users can participate in securing the Ethereum network while earning rewards. The move comes as staked ETH ratios continue rising after Ethereum’s recent upgrade. Coinbase Cloud is currently offering this new open staking access starting with integration in Coinbase Wallet.\n \nWhat do you think about Coinbase and Kiln’s announcement?

          "description": "In the first week of September, an outflow of $59 million worth of digital assets managed by Digital Asset Funds was recorded, the latest Coinshares data has shown. The latest outflow means the value of digital asset investment products under management has dropped by a total of $294 million or 0.9% in the past four weeks. The Coinshares data shows bitcoin (BTC) as the digital asset which had the highest net outflow ($69 million) in the first week of September.\n \nBitcoin Short Inflows the Largest Since March\n \nDuring the first week of September, digital asset investment products saw a net outflow of $59 million in assets under management (AUM), the latest data from the alternative asset manager Coinshare analysis has shown. According to the asset manager’s blog, the latest net outflow figure brings the value of total outflows in the past four weeks to $294 million, or 0.9% of total AUM.\n \n\n \nAs explained in the blog, inflows were also seen in short investment products and this may be an indication that the sentiment for digital assets remains poor. Concerns over the regulation of this asset class and the strengthening dollar are cited as some of the reasons why investors are less keen on investing in digital assets.\n \n \nIn terms of flows by asset, the Coinshares data shows bitcoin (BTC) as the digital asset that had the highest net outflow ($69 million) in the first week of September. On the other hand, short bitcoin net inflows during the same period topped $15 million, the largest since March 2023.\n \nMeanwhile, Ethereum’s net outflow of $4.8 million during the same period saw its year-to-date outflows rise to US$108m representing 1.6% of the total AUM of $6.9 billion. Out of all the digital assets tracked by Coinshares, only XRP and other unidentified digital assets are shown to have recorded positive inflows of $0.7 million and $0.4 million respectively.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

As of August 31, 2023, these liquid tokens have a combined value of $3.4 billion. Additionally, the update showcases nearly $200 million in Bahamian real estate. Solana (SOL) emerges as the dominant asset in FTX’s portfolio.\n \n \nAs of September 11, 2023, with SOL’s market cap standing at $7.24 billion, FTX’s slice is a significant 16%, equating to $1.16 billion. FTX’s diverse crypto portfolio also includes $560 million in BTC, $192 million in ETH, $137 million in APT, $120 million in USDT, $119 million in XRP, $49 million in BIT, $46 million in STG, $41 million in WBTC, and $37 million in WETH. Furthermore, FTX possesses over $529 million in securities housed in Debtor brokerage accounts, of which $417 million resides in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n \n \nApart from that, a modest $0.1 million is placed in Blackrock equity under FTX’s control. Delving into FTX’s venture collection, it boasts 438 investments, amassing $4.5 billion in funded assets. Notably, it includes a significant stake in Anthropic, a rival to Openai and the brains behind the generative AI chatbot, Claude. It’s worth mentioning that FTX also owns over 1,000 illiquid crypto assets, which may not realize their full potential value.\n \nWhat do you think about the FTX stakeholder update?
