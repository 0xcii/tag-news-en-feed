          "description": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved  \napplications from major exchanges like Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE to list  \nexchange-traded funds tied to the price of ether on Thursday.  This approval potentially opens the door for  \nthese products to begin trading later this year.\nIssuers to Seek Regulatory Approval\nNine issuers, including VanEck, ARK  \nInvestments/21Shares, and BlackRock, applied to launch ETFs tied to ether  \nfollowing the SEC's approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January. Despite the much-anticipated positive feedback, ether ETF issuers must obtain approval for ETF registration statements detailing investor disclosures before the products can start trading. Last-Minute Changes\nMarket participants were prepared for a negative  \noutcome, especially considering the lack of engagement from the SEC on the  \napplications, Reuters reported. However, in an unexpected turn of events, SEC  \nofficials on Monday requested the exchanges to make quick adjustments to the  \nfilings, leading to a rush within the industry to meet the new requirements in  \na short timeframe.\nIn the run-up to the decision-making deadline, the SEC’s Chair Gary Gensler, known for his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, declined to comment when reporters asked about the ether ETFs. The SEC spokesperson also stated that the agency would not provide  \nfurther comments on the matter.\nHowever, the SEC has no set timeframe for deciding on these statements, leaving industry participants uncertain about when  \ntrading could commence. Optimism about the SEC's approval of Ether ETF pushed the price of the  \nsecond-largest cryptocurrency by 25% in the past week. Notably, the asset management firm plans to avoid staking  \nand derivatives to address regulatory concerns. Similar activities by the SEC  \npreceded the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January, which became  \na record-breaking product launch. \n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.",
