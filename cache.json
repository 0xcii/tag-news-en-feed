Balchunas stated:\n \n\nUpdate: Nate’s instincts were right, hearing SEC finally gotten back to issuers today, asking them to return FINAL S-1s on Wed (incl fees) and then request effectiveness on Monday after close for a TUESDAY 7/23 LAUNCH. This is provided no unforeseeable last min issues of course!\n \n \nBitcoinist reported last week that one of the Ethereum ETF applicants, Bitwise Investment, has been making changes to its S-1 filings smoothly, with “fewer and fewer issues” being encountered along the way, according to the firm’s CCO Katherine Dowling.\n \nIn late June, Reuters reported that sources close to certain applicants believed that Ethereum ETFs could potentially be approved by July 4. However, due to the need for additional review and finalization of applications, the expected launch date has been pushed to July 23.\n \nETH Price Jumps 7%\n \nThe news of the impending launch has already sparked enthusiasm among investors, leading to a significant surge in Ethereum’s price. On Monday, Ethereum experienced a 7% surge, surpassing the $3,430 mark for the first time in two weeks. \n \nAdditionally, trading volume for the token rose by 71%, showcasing the widespread interest and anticipation surrounding the introduction of Ethereum ETFs and the expected impact on its price for further upside continuation.\n \n \n \nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",
