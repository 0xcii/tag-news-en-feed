The meme coin rose by as much as 2% in today’s session, as the global crypto market cap surged by the same amount. BNB was another notable gainer today.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) rose to a multi-week high in today’s session, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.000008759 to start the week, SHIB/USD jumped to a peak of $0.000009067 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of the move, SHIB climbed to its strongest point since May 10, when price hit a high of $0.00000930.\n \n \nOne of the catalysts of the surge appears to be a breakout which took place on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nThe index moved beyond the ceiling of 40.00, and as of writing is now tracking at 40.83.\n \nShould bulls continue to control sentiment, there is a chance they target an upcoming ceiling of 46.00 on the index.\n \n \nBNB\n \nBNB was another notable gainer on Tuesday, as prices rebounded from a key support level.\n \nBNB/USD rose to an intraday high of $315.21 in today’s session, 24 hours after hitting a low of $309.13.\n \nOverall, this recent run, which has seen BNB climb for two consecutive days, comes after a failed breakout of a floor at $302.00.\n \n \nDue to today’s uptrend, the RSI is now on the verge of colliding with a key resistance of 49.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 48.95, with earlier bulls possibly preparing to take profits.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect further gains in BNB this week?
