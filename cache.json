We're proud to walk the walk with BITB.\"\nIn a move that aligns with the growing demand for openness and accountability in the industry, Bitwise is providing investors and the public with real-time access to the Bitcoin addresses associated with its ETF holdings. This disclosure enhances transparency and and attempts to fosters trust, addressing concerns related to the verification of asset backing and allocation within the ETF.\n\"Publishing on-chain addresses is a first step toward increasing public transparency,\" Bitwise continued. \"As infrastructure evolves, we hope to do more, such as working with firms like hoseki app to provide real-time cryptographic attestations.\"\nThe decision to publish BTC address holdings helps positions Bitwise at the forefront of regulatory compliance and investor communication. By voluntarily sharing this information, Bitwise demonstrates a commitment to setting an industry standard and building credibility for Bitcoin investment products.\nEarlier this month, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially approved the listing of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since launch, the ETFs have seen billions of dollars in demand and have become the second largest ETF commodity in the country.",

Any open spot orders tied to these pairs will be  \nautomatically closed, aligning with the cessation of trading in these markets.\nAdditionally, Binance Convert and Binance Pay will  \ndelist all RUB trading pairs and exclude RUB from the list of supported fiat  \ncurrencies, effective January 30, 2024. This move signifies a comprehensive  \noverhaul, ensuring that RUB will no longer be integrated into these services.\nDeadline for Fiat Withdrawals\nFor users looking to withdraw RUB directly, Binance  \nFiat will support fiat withdrawals until January 31, 2024, at 00:00 UTC.  \nAccording to the crypto exchange, users must take advantage of this window to  \nsecure their funds seamlessly.\nLastly, Binance's P2P trading will delist all RUB  \ntrading pairs on January 31, 2024, at 00:00 UTC.
