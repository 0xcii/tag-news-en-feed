The ETF will track the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin ETFs through active investment. It has received approximately $53 million in initial investments at a listing price of $1 (HKD 7.75).\nThe approval of the ETFs has both positive and negative connotations — while it signals acceptance amongst traditional finance in the Asian markets, it is not truly bitcoin in the sense that one cannot exchange the ETF shares for real bitcoin, nor is the ETF itself backed by a reserve of actual bitcoin. There are claims that such “paper bitcoin” can suppress the price of real bitcoin through diversion of demand. \n\nThe first bitcoin futures ETF approved in America, the NYSE-listed ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, launched in October of 2021, with $1 billion in trading volume on its first day. Per the release, “In view of the increasing market acceptance of virtual assets, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission announced to allow the launch of ETFs tracking crypto futures for public offering on 31 October 2022, marking the first time Asian retail investors can get this type of exposure to virtual assets.”",

Energy is required to transform raw materials into final consumer goods and services.
