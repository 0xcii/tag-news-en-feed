This transformation signifies an important step as the  \ncompany marks ten years in the industry, bringing together Huobi's mission,  \nTRON token, and the essence of a crypto exchange.\nThe rebranding choice of  \n\"HTX\" carries significance, the exchange explained. Breaking it down, \"H\" pays  \nhomage to Huobi, \"T\" symbolizes TRON, and \"X\" represents the essence of an exchange. This combination of \"HT\"  \nand \"X\" depicts HT as the platform's native cryptocurrency, while \"X\" represents  \nthe Roman numeral for 10, acknowledging HTX's ten years in the industry.\n\nTwitter Space Alert!A New Chapter of #HuobiUnveiling the Future: #Huobi's Brand Upgrade to #HTXJoin us tmr at 8pm SGT🎤@33Huobi @99HTX_Set Your Reminder:https://t.co/d1bxqOVqtU…",
