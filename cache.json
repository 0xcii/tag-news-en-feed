          "description": "One selling point for Bitcoin is that it is politically neutral. After all, it's a ledger, decentralized, and wherever we each fall on the political spectrum, we all need to keep track of our own funds. That’s not to say everyone thinks Bitcoin is the best way to do this, but the neutrality of the technology itself looked like an area on which it was easy to find agreement.\n But recently, that sense of being removed from political partisanship has been called into question in the United States, where increasingly, attitudes towards cryptocurrencies appear to be dividing along party lines as we head towards the presidential election.
