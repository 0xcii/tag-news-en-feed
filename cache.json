The “Open Interest” here refers to a measure of the total amount of BTC-related derivative contracts currently open on all exchanges.\n \nWhen the value of this metric rises, it means that the investors are opening new positions on the derivative market right now. Generally, the total leverage in the market goes up when new contracts crop up, so an increase in the Open Interest could lead to higher volatility for the asset.\n \n \nOn the other hand, a decline in the indica…",

          "description": "Less than ten days remain until the most important event in the cryptocurrency sector: Bitcoin's halving. This event is expected to have a major impact on the sector due to recent developments surrounding the leading digital asset. Some of these developments include the emergence of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the evolving regulations for digital assets.\nHow Bitcoin Halving Works\nBitcoin's deflationary model depends on the upcoming halving  \nevent, which occurs approximately every four years. This process reduces the block reward by half, limiting the supply of new tokens. With each halving, the number of Bitcoins in circulation becomes scarce.\nThe impending halving will reduce the block reward  \nfrom 6.25 Bitcoins to 3.125 Bitcoins. Historically, halving events have led …",

          "description": "Hong Kong has reportedly approved its first spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with multiple issuers announcing they received permission to launch Bitcoin ETFs.\nChina Asset Management, Bosera Capital and other applicants posted on social media that they got clearance to list spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong. However, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has yet to release an official list of approved issuers.\nAccording to the posts, the SFC greenlit China Asset Management to offer spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in partnership with OSL and BOCI International. Other approved issuers include Harvest Global Investments, HashKey Capital, and Bosera Asset Management.\nThe news mirrors the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which launched in January and quickly attracted over $200 billion in trading volume. Hong Kong's approval marks a milestone as Asia's first jurisdiction to embrace spot Bitcoin ETFs.\nThe ETFs provide exposure to actual Bitcoin rather than derivatives, offering investors direct access to the assets. They also present a regulated investment vehicle that mitigates some of Bitcoin's risks.\nBy approving the ETFs, Hong Kong cements its Bitcoin-friendly stance amid ongoing efforts to become a finance hub. The accessibly traded funds could stimulate significant retail and institutional demand.\nHowever, an official SFC announcement remains pending. Some of the social media posts sharing the alleged approval have since been deleted. The opacity around permissions could contribute to market uncertainty in the near term.\nNonetheless, the reported approvals signal a willingness by Hong Kong's regulators to meet surging investor appetite for Bitcoin. The ETFs' launch will mark a major milestone for Bitcoin adoption and maturity in Asia.",
