Conversely, Blackrock’s IBIT has bolstered its bitcoin assets by 4,603.24 bitcoin, valued at $199 million.\n \nGBTC’s Bitcoin Holdings Wane as Competing Funds Increase Their Caches\n \nOn Jan. 30, 2024, Grayscale’s GBTC’s bitcoin portfolio stood at 496,573.81 BTC, with an estimated market value of $21.43 billion. GBTC has experienced a significant depletion in its bitcoin reserve, with a decrease of approximately 120,506.18 BTC, equivalent to around $5.23 billion in value, since Jan. 12. On Jan. 29, the combined trade volume for all ten spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reached $1.59 billion, with GBTC contributing $576.01 million to this figure.\n \nWhile GBTC experienced a decrease, Blackrock’s IBIT witnessed growth in the past day, escalating from 52,025.76 BTC to a current tally of 56,629.00 BTC, as per the latest IBIT figures. Fidelity’s most recent update for their holdings on Jan. 30 remains pending, and as of Jan. 29, FBTC’s holdings were at 46,238.09 BTC. However, onchain data indicates an increase to 47,238 BTC. ARKB, managed by Ark Invest and 21shares, now possesses 14,790 BTC. Bitwise’s BITB maintains a reserve of 13,576.10 BTC, having observed no growth in the last day.\n \n \nThe rest of the ETFs have yet to refresh their holding reports. Currently, Invesco has 6,833 BTC, Vaneck possesses 2,885.46 BTC, Valkyrie owns 2,635.29 BTC, and Franklin Templeton’s holdings are at 1,363 BTC.

Dubbed by Michael Saylor as “the biggest Wall Street development in the last 30 years”, the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETF is the financial world’s first step toward ameliorating our highly archaic financial system. While there are countless explanations about how impactful the concept of decentralizing money would be for trade, commerce, and financial inclusion, what often goes overlooked are the philosophical and psychological implications of how we redefine wealth and who has it.
