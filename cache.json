President Biden stated, “We reiterated once again that default is off the table and the only way to move forward is in good faith toward a bipartisan agreement.”\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) rose above $27,000 on Tuesday, as a result of weakness in the greenback, following failed talks to increase the U.S. debt ceiling.\n \nAfter dropping to a low of $26,714.18 to start the week, BTC/USD surged to a peak of $27,434.68 earlier today.\n \nTuesday’s gains saw bitcoin marginally break out of a resistance level at the $27,300 mark.\n \n \nThis coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) climbing above a ceiling of its own, at 44.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 47.10, with an upcoming zone of 50.00 a likely target for bulls.\n \nShould they reach this point, there is a reasonable chance that bitcoin will trade above $27,600.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) also surged higher in today’s session, as prices continued to move away from a key level of support.\n \nETH/USD hit an intraday high of $1,869.34 on Monday, 24 hours removed from trading at a bottom of $1,809.54.\n \nThe move came as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency bounced away from a recent floor at $1,790.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, today’s surge comes following a slight breakout of a ceiling on the RSI at the 50.00 mark.\n \nAs of writing, price strength is now tracking at 51.97, with the next visible level of resistance at 55.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould momentum be set to finally rise in crypto markets?
