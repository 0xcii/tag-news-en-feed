Following its mid-December peak to an all-time high (ATH), BONK has plummeted 57% from its ATH. \n \nFrom Peak to Plunge in the Meme Coin Madness\n \nBONK has witnessed a downturn over the past two weeks and on Dec. 30, 2023, it has an intraday trading range of $0.00001387 to $0.00001536, and at the time of writing, it is exchanging hands for $0.00001446, down 4.4% over the past day. While the crypto asset lost 41% over the two-week span and more than 20% this past week, BONK is still up by 272% over the last 30 days.\n \n\n \nHowever, with prices at $0.00001446, the value of BONK is down 57% since the ATH of $0.00003416 per unit on Dec. 15, 2023. Despite the loss, BONK is still the third largest meme coin asset by market capitalization under DOGE and SHIB, and its overall valuation today is $887 million. BONK’s market cap is above the fourth largest meme coin CORGIAI’s $633 million valuation.\n \nThere are 56.02 trillion BONK in circulation as of Dec. 30, 2023, and 566,773 addresses hold BONK. The top ten wallets command 33.72% of the circulating supply and the top 20 holders command 40.49% of all the BONK. The top 100 BONK holders command 55.08% while the top address holds 11.68%.\n \n \nThe future trajectory of bonk (BONK) remains uncertain as the market’s whims could either further its decline or foster a resurgence. Amidst its current volatility, other meme coins are vying for the spotlight, each aspiring to replicate BONK’s earlier success. As these contenders inch closer, the landscape of meme cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, leaving BONK’s fate in the balance amidst this competitive fray.\n \nWhat do you think about BONK’s decline over the last two weeks?

Congressman Davidson wrote on social media platform X Thursday:\n \n\n2024 would be a great time to fire Gary Gensler, pass the SEC Stabilization Act, hold the SEC accountable for its corruption, and end the accredited investor rule that protects deal flow for the donor class.\n \nDavidson introduced the SEC Stabilization Act earlier in June to fire Gensler as the chair of the securities regulator. He previously explained that the bill would “remove the role of chairman,” noting: “It would preserve the current commissioners but it would add a sixth commissioner so there would be no more than three from any one political party.”\n \nCongressman Emmer has also repeatedly criticized Gensler for his enforcement-centric approach to regulating the crypto industry. He wrote on X Thursday: “Gensler’s SEC sides with Wall Street, not Main Street. I’m proud to join Warren Davidson as a co-lead on his bill, the SEC Stabilization Act, so we can fire Gary Gensler.”\n \nDavidson is also against the Federal Reserve launching a digital dollar. In an X post on Tuesday, the lawmaker called for the ban of central bank digital currencies. He opined:\n \n\nCentral bank digital currency (CBDC) poses an existential threat to western civilization. Sound money serves as a stable store of value and an efficient means of exchange. CBDC consummates the corruption of money into a dystopian tool for coercion & control. Ban them.\n \nDo you think SEC Chair Gary Gensler should be fired? Let us know in the comments section below.",
