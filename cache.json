          "description": "The drama surrounding the FTX collapse continues to unfold with a surprising twist. Sam Bankman-Fried, the crypto wunderkind turned convicted fraudster, has agreed to cooperate with investors suing the company’s celebrity endorsers, including sports stars Tom Brady and Shaquille O’Neal, and actor Larry David.\n \n \nThis move comes as a shock considering Bankman-Fried is currently appealing his 25-year prison sentence for defrauding FTX customers. The class-action lawsuit against the celebrity endorsers accuses them of deception and making false claims about the safety of FTX’s crypto assets.
