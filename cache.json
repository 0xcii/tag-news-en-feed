As September nears its end with six days remaining, NFT sales have tallied up to $341.37 million since August 24.\n \nNFT Sales Still Can’t Escape Crypto Winter’s Wrath\n \nThis September, over the last seven days, NFT sales touched $78.88 million, marking a 3.2% dip from the preceding week, according to cryptoslam.io stats. 2023 has seen a consistent slump in digital collectible sales, and September is no exception.\n \n\n \nThe monthly tally stands at $341.37 million, a sharp 34.08% decline from the previous month. Ethereum continues its dominance in NFT sales, raking in $177,743,112 over the last month.\n \n\n \nHowever, it’s worth noting that ETH-centric NFT sales have dropped by 41.84% since the month prior. Trailing Ethereum is the Mythos blockchain, registering $31.89 million in sales — a notable 24.86% surge from the month before. Following Mythos are Polygon, Solana, Immutable X, and Bitcoin in terms of 30-day sales.\n \nDmarket, Draftkings, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Gods Unchained, and Sorare top the charts in 30-day sales records. However, the latter three NFT collections faced setbacks this month, while Dmarket and Draftkings enjoyed upticks ranging between 15% and 24%.\n \n \nEthereum’s crowning NFT sale this month was a “Mega Zombie,” fetching a price of $800,044. Immutable X’s “Cross the Ages #223963” took second place, selling for $151,012. Rounding off the top three was a Bitcoin-based NFT from the “OCM Dimensions” collection, which garnered $106,708.\n \n2023 has proven challenging for NFT investors, with prices taking a substantial hit. It’s been a chilling crypto winter, and NFTs haven’t been spared its icy grasp. The industry awaits, with bated breath, to see if NFT markets will find their spring resurgence.\n \nWhat do you think about the last 30 days of NFT sales?

          "description": "Recently, Ethereum has seen a shift towards inflation, sparked by a dip in network activity and onchain fees. Data reveals that, with decreased activity and lower fees, Ethereum’s inflation rate stands at 0.270%. The decline in overall activity and people transitioning to layer two (L2) networks has notably curtailed base fee burning.\n \nFrom Deflation to Inflation: Ethereum’s Issuance Rate Changes Course\n \nAfter The Merge and up until three months ago, Ethereum’s supply trended deflationary. Historical data highlights that on May 27, 2023, ultrasound.money pegged Ethereum’s inflation rate at -0.654% annually. Yet, by September 23, 2023, this rate had risen to 0.270%.\n \n \nEthereum’s shift towards deflation was driven by two landmark events: the implementation of EIP-1559, known as the London hard fork, and The Merge‘s switch from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n \nAfter the implementation of EIP-1559, an Ethereum transaction’s base fee now gets “burned” by sending it to a null address. Post-Merge, the rate of issuance declined notably. Had it not been for the transition from PoW, the inflation would have touched a considerable 3.689% per annum.\n \n \nAll this in view, there’s been a pronounced lull in daily transactions, with significant lows around mid-year and another as we approached the end of August and early September. In fact, September 10 saw a dip to 866,548 transactions, a fall of 62,852 from the day prior.\n \n \nMoreover, Ethereum’s network fees have been on a downward trajectory, mirroring the reduced activity. This decline has persisted since May 2023, with September 9 and 10 marking the year’s lowest daily fees.\n \nOn the flip side, layer two (L2) networks have experienced heightened activity, leading to a drop in Ethereum blockchain transactions. This dynamic has resulted in fewer base burns, tempering the deflationary pressure on issuance.\n \nWhat do you think about Ethereum’s supply rate turning inflationary?
