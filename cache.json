          "description": "Solana extended recent gains on Saturday, as the token rose for a third straight session to start the weekend. Today’s move came following a breakout of a key price level, despite the global crypto market cap consolidating. Avalanche also rallied, climbing by as much as 10%.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) was a notable gainer in the crypto market for a third straight day, with today’s move taking price to an eight-week high.\n \nFollowing a low of $20.19 on Friday, SOL/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $22.40 to start the weekend.\n \nAs a result of the surge, solana raced past a ceiling of $22.00, hitting its highest point since May 6 in the process.\n \n \nFrom the chart, the move occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped beyond a ceiling at the 69.00 mark.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 70.70, with the next visible point of resistance at 75.00.\n \nShould the index reach this point, there is a good chance that SOL will climb to $23.00.\n \n \nAvalanche (AVAX)\n \nAnother notable gainer on Saturday was avalanche (AVAX), which rose by nearly 10% in today’s session.\n \nAVAX/USD climbed to a high of $13.85 earlier in today’s session, a day after trading at a low of $12.60.\n \nThe move resulted in avalanche jumping to its strongest level since June 9, after breaking out of a resistance level of $13.50.\n \n \nOne of the catalysts of this rally was the 14-day RSI breaking out of its own ceiling at the 57.00 mark.\n \nThe index is now tracking at 58.73, and looks to be making strides for a higher point of resistance at 62.00.\n \nAdditionally, the 10-day (red) moving average has just avoided a downward crossover, with momentum once again shifting upward.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect avalanche to hit $15.00 in the next few days?
