          "description": "Bitcoin development nonprofit, Brink, has received a significant financial boost with a pledge of $5 million from Jack Dorsey's #startsmall organization. The pledge, totaling $1 million per year for the next five years, aims to support Brink's efforts in funding Bitcoin developers and ensuring the long-term sustainability of Bitcoin's core codebase.\nBrink aims to provide fellowship and support to Bitcoin and Bitcoin-adjacent developers. The organization offers developer grants, mentorship programs and funding opportunities to promote open-source development for Bitcoin and related technologies. By nurturing new contributors and decentralizing Bitcoin's protocol development, Brink hopes to strengthen the Bitcoin network and developer ecosystem.\nExpressing his gratitude for the generous pledge, Mike Schmidt said, \"Brink is very grateful for this extended pledge to support our Bitcoin developer funding efforts. $1,000,000 a year for each of the next 5 years means that we can help make Bitcoin development a sustainable career for the talented developers that are building, securing, testing, and reviewing the Bitcoin Core codebase.\"\nThe support from #startsmall will contribute significantly to Brink's mission of supporting Bitcoin development and fostering open-source decentralized systems. This substantial funding injection will enable Brink to provide ongoing support to Bitcoin developers and facilitate their crucial work in maintaining and enhancing the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nBrink is actively engaged in creating a sustainable environment for Bitcoin development. With the additional funding, they can attract more talent, further educate developers, and expand their fellowship and grant programs. This financial backing not only demonstrates the commitment of #startsmall to open-source initiatives but also highlights the growing importance of Bitcoin and its underlying technology.\nTo learn more about Brink and its programs, visit their website at brink.dev.",

This decline comes as overall market sentiment remains bearish, following last week’s actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Cardano was also back in the red today.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, dropped by over 9% in today’s session, as traders seemingly moved to secure recent gains.\n \nXRP/USD rose to a ten-week high of $0.5614 on Tuesday, however today’s sell-off has sent the token to a bottom at $0.5009.\n \nThe decline comes as bulls were unable to maintain yesterday’s breakout of a key resistance level at $0.5490.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the shift in sentiment came as the relative strength index (RSI) retreated to a floor of its own at 52.00\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking marginally above this point at 52.11, with a ceiling of 58.00 the possible target for bulls.\n \nIn the event it reaches this level, it is likely that XRP will once again be trading above $0.5500.\n \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) was another notable token to move into the red on Wednesday, with the price remaining close to a key support point.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.2895 on Tuesday, ADA/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.2699 today.\n \nAs a result of the move, cardano remained near its long-term price floor at $0.2700, which was broken over the weekend.\n \n \nSaturday’s drop sent ADA to its weakest point since January, however this decline was short lived, with bulls sweeping in to buy the dip.\n \nDespite rebounding in recent days, the RSI continues to track below 30.00, which is a sign of current bearish pressure.\n \nBulls are likely looking at the $0.3000 level as a short-term target, however there will likely be a high level of volatility preventing this point from being hit.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill there be a price recovery in cardano this week?
