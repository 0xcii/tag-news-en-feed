The move comes despite the global crypto market mostly consolidating during today’s session. Cardano was another notable mover, rallying away from a support point of its own.\n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin (TON) moved away from a multi-week low in today’s session, as price climbed above the $2.00 mark.\n \nFollowing a low of $1.95 on Wednesday, TON/USD bulls pushed the token to a peak of $2.10 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of the surge, toncoin bounced from its lowest point since September 15, which has also been a key support point.\n \n \nTraders opted to buy the dip at this point, with the relative strength index (RSI) rising past a ceiling of 50.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 50.73, with a ceiling of 54.00 a possible target for buyers.\n \nShould this point be hit, there is a good chance that TON will hit a ceiling at the $2.20 region in the coming days.\n \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nAdditionally, cardano (ADA) was a notable gainer, with the cryptocurrency climbing away from a floor of its own.\n \nADA/USD rose to a high of $0.2628 earlier in the day, which comes after a low of $0.255 the day prior.\n \nToday’s move saw cardano move away from its recent support point at $0.250, just as the RSI bounced from a floor of its own.\n \n \nAfter colliding with a floor at the 55.00 mark, price strength has gone on to reach a high peak at 58.82.\n \nThe next visible ceiling looks to be at the 65.00 zone, and in the event bulls manage to reach this point, ADA will likely rise above $0.270.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill cardano extend gains in the coming days?

The sudden reversal of the alpha crypto’s fortunes, retreating more than 5% in the last 24 hours, has caught many overzealous traders off guard. As a result, a flurry of liquidations totaling nearly $73 million in the same timeframe has left the crypto landscape reeling.\n \nThe bulk of these liquidations, a staggering $61.72 million, came from the altcoin arena, where tokens like Aave, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV have taken the brunt of the collapse.

          "description": "In the ongoing criminal case against Sam Bankman-Fried, federal prosecutors have unveiled a forfeiture bill, indicating the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) intent to commandeer two luxury jets belonging to the ex-FTX chief. Specifically, the DOJ has its sights set on a Bombardier Global 5000 BD-700-1A11 and an Embraer Legacy 135BJ.\n \nProsecutors Set Sights on Seizing Bankman-Fried’s Luxury Aircraft\n \nOn the evening of October 4, the DOJ detailed its plans to seize these high-end aircraft from Bankman-Fried, co-founder and former CEO of FTX. The court order highlighted that these jets are implicated in multiple charges, specifically counts 1-4 and 7, of the federal indictment.\n \n \nIn addition to the Bombardier and Embraer jets, the DOJ is also keen on acquiring their associated maintenance and engine logs. This development comes on the heels of earlier reports, post-FTX’s downfall, which suggested that Bankman-Fried’s personal aircraft had made multiple trips between the Bahamas and Argentina.\n \n \nContradicting these claims, Bankman-Fried had asserted he never left the Bahamas. Adding another layer to the narrative, there were whispers that FTX’s private jets were repurposed to ferry Amazon packages to top-tier FTX personnel, given Amazon’s refusal to deliver to the Bahamas. In a related twist, Ryan Salame, FTX’s former co-CEO, reportedly had to part with his private jet as a bargaining chip in his plea negotiations.\n \nWhat do you think about Sam Bankman-Fried losing his jets to forfeiture?
