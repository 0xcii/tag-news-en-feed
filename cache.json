          "description": "The crypto revolution was finally taken to new heights when the SEC approved 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024. Global investors flooded in like never seen before, adding almost $5 billion of inflows on the first day of trading. As a result, the crossover between traditional finance and digital assets is now firmly established, and a new door of opportunities for crypto will open as the market continues to mature. This marks the end of a decade-long struggle for legitimacy, showcasing the success of progress not only in blockchain technology itself but also in the public’s perception of money. Crypto is here to stay.\nIn the early years of Bitcoin, many native crypto investors believed that Wall Street needed Bitcoin but not vice versa. This one-way love affair was true for a while, but …",

The Texas power grid creaks and groans when it’s put to the test during extreme weather events and sometimes it goes down leaving citizens out in the cold. However this time the power stayed on and it was in large part due to an unexpected recent phenomenon: Bitcoin Mining. Bitcoin miners turned their operations off to redirect power back to critical infrastructure & reduce stress on the Texas grid.

This marketplace allows users to list, bid, and purchase items with ease, all while transacting in KYC-free bitcoin.\n“Bitcoin is repricing the world,” says Chris Tramount, Chief Executive Pleb of SatsCrap's parent company Scarce City. “We’re creating an option for people to exchange crap that will lose value in bitcoin terms over time for the hard money of the future.”\nSellers on SatsCrap are required to deposit a small amount of bitcoin as collateral, ensuring accountability and facilitating a seamless seller experience. Leveraging AI technology, the platform automatically suggests auction titles and descriptions based on uploaded item photos, enabling users to create listings in under 60 seconds.\nWith a mission to offer the lowest prices on the internet for everyday items and collectibles, according to the release, SatsCrap wants to provide buyers with various payment options, including on-chain or Lightning bitcoin, as well as fiat alternatives like credit card, Afterpay, and Cash App Pay.\nPowered by Scarce City's extensive experience in facilitating bitcoin transactions, SatsCrap aims to help redefine the future of online selling by embracing Bitcoin. The company also stated that to celebrate its launch, SatsCrap is waiving listing fees throughout February.",
