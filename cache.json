The move came following a two-week low on Tuesday, as markets slipped after recent highs. XRP also edged higher, and currently hovers near a key price floor.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) recovered from a two-week low on Wednesday, as bulls took advantage of yesterday’s dip in price.\n \nAfter slipping to a bottom of $22.86 on Tuesday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $24.56 earlier in the day.\n \nThe token has mostly traded lower in recent weeks, after surging to an eight-month high above $30.00 on June 14.\n \n \nToday’s rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) bounced on a floor at the 52.00 mark.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 57.51, and looks set to be heading for a ceiling at 60.00.\n \nShould it reach this point, there is a strong possibility SOL will be above $25.00.\n \n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was trading close to a key support point during today’s session, as price continued to consolidate.\n \nXRP/USD peaked at $0.7141 earlier in today’s session, after slipping to an intraday low of $0.6961 the day prior.\n \nSince surging to $0.9479 earlier this month, XRP has mostly traded between a floor at $0.7000 and ceiling of $0.8200.\n \n \nFollowing a brief move below the aforementioned support point, XRP bulls have reentered to push the price higher.\n \nThis coincided with price strength finding a stable zone at 57.00, helping increase bullish prospects.\n \nThe next target to maintain today’s slight rebound will be to capture the $0.7500 resistance level.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould XRP move above $0.7500 before the end of July?

          "description": "Bitcoin consolidated marginally above the $29,000 level on Wednesday, ahead of today’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. It is widely expected that the Fed will increase rates by 25 basis points, after holding off on hiking last month. Ethereum also remained mostly unchanged.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin started today’s session largely unchanged, as traders anticipated the latest Federal Reserve rate decision.\n \nFollowing a low of $29,097.47 on Tuesday, BTC/USD marginally rose to a high of $29,382.11 earlier today.\n \nThis move saw the cryptocurrency consolidate around a support point at the $29,100 mark, which was last fully broken on June 21.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nAnother floor was hit in today’s session, as the relative strength index (RSI) collided with the 42.00 zone.\n \n \nPrice strength has since rebounded, and at the time of writing this is tracking at a reading of 42.09.\n \nShould the index remain above this level after today’s rate decision, there is a good chance that BTC could move back towards $30,000.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nAdditionally, ethereum (ETH) also consolidated on Wednesday, trading close to a key price floor at $1,850.\n \nETH/USD peaked at $1,867.32 earlier in today’s session, before slipping to a current day’s low of $1,849.44.\n \nThe decline came as the 10-day (red) moving average extended its downward crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nA key area to pay attention to is the floor at 45.00 on the RSI. The index is currently hovering around this mark, however a breakout could result in further declines.\n \n \nIn the event this occurs, the next visible support level to pay attention to will be the 40.00 zone.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you believe the Fed should stop hiking rates?
