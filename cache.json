Recently, two different projects took turnkey steps into turning this development into a reality for the original cryptocurrency, an advancement that could help Bitcoin scale even more and also provide additional privacy assurances to users that decide to use it.\nChainway last week announced the open-sourcing of their data availability (DA) adapter, a piece of technology that allows developers to leverage Bitcoin’s security and finality to develop rollups with the Sovereign Software Development Kit (SDK). Sovereign provides bundled services for developers to build different kinds of rollups, and Chainway’s launch seeks to enable Bitcoin’s first ZK rollup.\nKasar Labs teamed up with Taproot Wizards to coincidently release a DA adapter for Bi…",

          "description": "Shiba inu started the week by dropping to its lowest point since June, as a red wave swept through cryptocurrency markets. This has pushed the global market cap 1.20% lower at the time of writing. XRP fell by as much as 5%, as Ripple’s battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continued.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB )\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) edged lower on Monday, as the meme coin fell to its weakest point in over two months.\n \nSHIB/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.000007028 on Monday, following a high of $0.000007413 the day prior.\n \nThis was the weakest point that shiba inu has traded at since June 20, when the price bottomed out at $0.00000698.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) fell below a support point at the 34.00 level.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 30.42, with the next visible floor around the 28.00 region.\n \nOverall, SHIB has now fallen lower for four consecutive days, and seems to be heading towards the $0.00000680 zone.\n \n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, fell by as much as 5% on Monday, as markets continued to react to the latest news surrounding a lawsuit with the SEC.\n \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said it would appeal a decision by a U.S. judge not to find Ripple Labs guilty of violating securities laws.\n \nXRP/USD dropped to a low of $0.4682 on the news, which came following a high of $0.5007 the day prior.\n \n \nAs a result of the decline in price, XRP slipped to its weakest point since mid-August, falling below a floor on the RSI in the process.\n \nPrice strength now sits at 26.82, which is deep in oversold territory, with a lower floor of 23.00 still a possible target for traders.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould XRP extend declines in the coming days?
