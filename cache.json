          "description": "The emergence of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) has ignited widespread interest, sparking enthusiasm among central bankers, generating curiosity within financial media, and fueling spirited debates in the Bitcoin community. Among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, opinions on CBDCs vary widely, ranging from viewing them as powerful tools for government surveillance and control to seeing them as desperate attempts by traditional fiat systems to maintain relevance. In this essay, we will explore the assertion that CBDCs are unlikely to attain widespread adoption, while bitcoin is poised to emerge as the dominant digital currency. Three pivotal factors support this argument: Bitcoin's open and permissionless nature, its first-mover advantage, and its user-centric monetary policy.\nOpen and P…",

And could this bigger cycle reflect the way humans adopt new technologies? And is it possible we have seen something similar before with another technology like the internet? In this article, we will be diving into a new theory that suggests that Bitcoin is moving through a larger 16-year cycle which can help us predict the direction of the Bitcoin price in the coming years. \nThe Regular 4 Year Cycle\nBitcoin tends to go through 4-year cycles which are divided into 2 parts, the uptrend and the downtrend.
