The analyst alluded to historical trends to prove why the flagship crypto could easily attain such a price target.\n \nBitcoin To Hit $156,000 By May 2025\n \nCryptorphic mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “Bitcoin could hit $156,000 by May 27, 2025!.” To back up his prediction, he highlighted the flagship crypto’s price action after previous halvings and noted that there has never been a “red year” after these historical events.
