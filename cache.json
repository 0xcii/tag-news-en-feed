Price fell by as much as 4% earlier in the day, as price approached a breakout below the $2.00 mark. On the other hand, solana continued to trade around the $33.00 mark.\n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin dropped for a second straight day on Friday, as bears pushed the cryptocurrency close to a breakout below the $2.00 level.\n \nFollowing a high of $2.17 during yesterday’s session, TON/USD slipped to an intraday low of $2.07 earlier today.\n \nAs a result of the decline, toncoin continued to track a one-week low, and close to a key price floor of $2.00.\n \n \nOne reason TON remains above the aforementioned level is as a result of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is above its own floor at 50.00.\n \nIn the event that this point is broken, there is a strong possibility that bearish sentiment will significantly increase.\n \nIf so, traders will possibly be targeting a lower support point of $1.90.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) made slight gains earlier in the day, as the token hovered close to a one-year low above $33.00.\n \nSOL/USD rose to a peak of $33.30 during today’s session, after falling to a low at $30.80 on Thursday.\n \nEarlier gains have since faded, with the world’s seventh largest cryptocurrency now trading at $32.37.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the 14-day RSI is marginally above a floor at 74.00, with a current reading of 74.43.\n \nShould bulls sustain this level, there is a good chance that solana could make another run towards $35.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill solana reach $35.00 during November?
