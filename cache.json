Buterin emphasizes the stifling effect of rising crypto transaction fees on innovation and broad-based usage of cryptocurrency. He points out the shift towards centralized solutions and the dominance of high-stake players, expressing concern over the changing landscape and culture within the crypto community.\n \nFrom Decentralization to ‘Degen’ Domination: Buterin Reflects on Web3’s Path\n \nVitalik Buterin, the influential co-founder of Ethereum, has recently voiced concerns over the evolving dynamics of the Web3 environment.

          "description": "In light of the ongoing dialogue around Binance’s removal of privacy coins, the cryptocurrency exchange Okx has declared the removal of various spot trading pairs linked to privacy tokens such as monero, zcash, and dash. Okx attributes its decision to remove these offerings to “feedback from users” along with the exchange’s established guidelines for delisting.\n \nPrivacy Tokens Take a Hit: Okx Joins Binance in Major Delisting Wave\n \nOnce more, privacy coins face removals as regulatory and compliance requirements intensified significantly throughout 2023. Okx revealed the removal of 20 trading pairs, set to cease operation after Jan. 5, 2024. Two days prior on Dec. 27, Okx halted deposits for ZEN, XMR, CAPO, DASH, FSN, CVP, ZKS, and ZEC. The suspension of withdrawals for these coins is slated for March 5, 2024.\n \n“In order to maintain a robust spot trading environment, we constantly monitor the performance of all listed trading pairs and review their listing qualifications on a regular basis,” the exchange details. “Based on feedback from users and the Okx Token Delisting / Hiding Guideline, we will be delisting several trading pairs that do not fulfill our listing criteria.”\n \n \nAdvocates of privacy are expressing discontent with the delisting moves by Okx and Binance. Conversely, some argue that they are indifferent and that certain privacy coins will continue to thrive regardless of support from exchanges.\n \n\n \nFollowing the announcement, a significant dip occurred in the value of many privacy coins on Friday, with the entire privacy coin market declining over 6% against the U.S. dollar. XMR fell 3.6%, ZEC decreased by 11.3%, and DASH lost 9% in a 24-hour period.\n \nWhat do you think about Okx delisting privacy coins?

Records indicate that a substantial 97.88% of community votes supported the reduction of 300 million CAKE, decreasing the total supply from 750 million to 450 million CAKE tokens. \n \nNear-Unanimous Vote Cuts CAKE Supply\n \nOn Dec. 21, 2023, the Pancakeswap community received a governance proposal to deduct 300 million CAKE tokens from the total crypto asset supply. Voting commenced on Thursday and concluded on Friday, Dec. 29, 2023, culminating in the community’s endorsement of the supply cut.\n \nA resounding 97.88% of the community voted in favor of the proposal, with a mere 2.12% opposing it. The action will reduce the supply from 750 million CAKE to 450 million. “With a current circulating supply of 388M CAKE, the Kitchen believes this new and lower cap will be sufficient to gain market share across all chains and sustain the VECAKE model,” stated the original proposal.\n \nFollowing the governance vote, Pancakeswap’s CAKE surged 42.6% against the U.S. dollar over the previous week and achieved an over 62% increase for the month. Nonetheless, CAKE experienced a slight dip of about 2.4% against the greenback in the past day. Currently, CAKE boasts a market capitalization of $872 million, representing 0.05% of the total $1.75 trillion crypto economy.\n \n \nCurrently standing as the third-largest decentralized exchange (dex) globally by volume, Pancakeswap holds $1.66 billion in total value locked (TVL) within the protocol. The dex platform has seen a 16.81% increase over the past month. Despite a monthly surge of 62% in CAKE, the dex platform’s native crypto is still trading 91.80% below its all-time high of $43.96 per coin set on April 30, 2021. As of today, CAKE’s 24-hour intraday trading range has fluctuated between $3.49 and $3.83 per unit.\n \nWhat do you think about CAKE’s supply reduction?
