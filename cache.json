          "description": "For the first time in months, the entire list of top ten stablecoin assets has experienced supply shrinkage in the last 30 days. The stablecoin market now stands at $124 billion, following notable reductions across several projects. Yet, stablecoins still dominate in terms of global trade volume, accounting for 61% of all settled trades in the past day.\n \nTop 10 Stablecoin Supplies Drop Lower in 30 Days; FDUSD’s Supply Jumps 23% Higher\n \nEach of the ten premier stablecoins by market value has observed a decrease in supply. Notably, tether (USDT) experienced a 1.3% dip in its circulation over the recent month. USDC’s supply has diminished by 3%, and Makerdao’s DAI took a 7.6% hit.\n \nThe Paxos-backed BUSD now hovers slightly above 3 billion, shedding 15.7% of its circulating supply since the same period last month. Meanwhile, trueusd (TUSD) and Frax’s FRAX supply lessened by 1% and a whopping 19.8%, respectively.\n \nBoth USDD and USDP underwent reductions ranging from 1.2% to 10.1%. Concurrently, gemini dollar (GUSD) saw a sharp 36% drop this month, while liquity usd (LUSD) decreased by 1.4% in a month.\n \nIn contrast, the freshly introduced stablecoin, FDUSD, has expanded its supply significantly. On August 3, 2023, Bitcoin.com News highlighted FDUSD’s supply at 232 million, and now it’s around 287 million.\n \n \nThis indicates that in the last 15 days, FDUSD’s supply surged by 23.7%, even as most of the top ten stablecoins faced significant withdrawals. Binance wallets predominantly hold FDUSD’s supply, with only 26 distinct holders as of August 18, 2023.\n \nWith 61% of today’s trades associated with stablecoins, the total value reaches $74.26 billion at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on this Friday. Out of this, tether (USDT) represents a staggering $52.73 billion, translating to 71% of the global stablecoin trade volume for the day.\n \nWhat do you think about the past 30 days of stablecoin action and the reductions within that time span?

Today’s sell-off saw the global market cap fall by roughly 6.20%, at the time of writing. XRP also fell significantly.\n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nLitecoin (LTC) fell by as much as 15% on Friday, as a red wave washed over the cryptocurrency market.\n \nLTC/USD fell to a low of $61.76 late on Thursday, which came following a high of $74.73 earlier in the day.\n \nThis decline pushed LTC to its lowest point since December 19, when price traded to a low of $61.00.\n \n \nAs a result of this sell-off, the relative strength index (RSI) fell below the 30.00 level, which means price is oversold.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 18.21, which is its weakest point since November 2018.\n \nThe price has since moved away from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $64.80.\n \n \nXRP\n \nAdditionally, XRP, formerly ripple, also had significant declines on Friday, falling to a multi-month low of its own.\n \nAfter climbing to a high of $0.5852 on Thursday, XRP/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.4681 later in the session.\n \nThe move saw XRP dive to its weakest point since May 16, when the price traded around the $0.4300 region.\n \n \nThis drop saw the token marginally break out of a key support point at $0.4600, wiping out all gains accrued following the ripple ruling.\n \nLike with bitcoin above, price strength is now oversold, which prompted bulls to reenter, pushing XRP slightly higher.\n \nAs of writing, the token is trading at $0.5087.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill sentiment remain lower this weekend?
