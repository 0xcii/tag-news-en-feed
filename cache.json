          "description": "Bitmain, a leading bitcoin mining rig manufacturer, has introduced the newest addition to its Antminer products: the S21 series. The newest models have an efficiency rating under 20 joules per terahash (J/T) and produce between 200 terahash per second (TH/s) and 335 TH/s.\n \nBitmain Launches 2 New Antminers; Invests $54M in Core Scientific\n \nAt the 2023 World Digital Mining Summit in Hong Kong, Bitmain showcased its latest rigs from the Antminer S21 series. One machine employs hydro mining, and the other is air-cooled.\n \nThe S21 Hyd achieves up to 335 TH/s with an efficiency rating of 16 J/T. In contrast, the air-cooled S21 miner delivers up to 200 TH/s and has an efficiency rating around 17.5 J/T.\n \nThe Bitmain announcement comes after Canaan introduced its new Avalon miners. However, only one of them, the liquid cooling machine, has a 19.5 J/T efficiency, while Canaan’s air-cooled miner reaches 21.5 J/T.\n \n\n \nAdditionally, competitor Microbt aims to launch a machine with an efficiency under 20 J/T. Bitmain’s newest hydro-cooled rig contends with Microbt’s hydro-cooled M53S++ in hashrate. Nevertheless, its efficiency rating of 16 J/T outperforms Microbt’s rig, which has 22 J/T.\n \nBesides Bitmain’s new rigs, the company has invested $54 million in Core Scientific through a fresh supply contract. Bitmain will deliver 27,000 bitcoin miners to Core Scientific and has entered a hosting agreement with the company.\n \nThe common stock and cash transaction will provide Core Scientific with Bitmain’s S19J XP Antiminer, which produces 151 TH/s and 21.7 J/T. “We look forward to deepening our strategic relationship with Core Scientific, our long-standing U.S.-based partner,” Max Hua, Bitmain’s CEO remarked.\n \nWhat do you think about Bitmain’s latest mining rigs and the efficiency ratings they provide?

          "description": "A recent buzz within crypto circles revolves around a 1996 research paper from the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). There’s burgeoning speculation: did the NSA lay the groundwork for Bitcoin? Indeed, there are striking similarities between the NSA document and the Bitcoin white paper. However, a detailed look suggests a tighter connection to centralized Chaumian models described years prior.\n \nFrom NSA’s Vaults to Satoshi’s Vision: Tracing Bitcoin’s Alleged Origins\n \nBitcoin, whose existence is widely attributed to the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto, now has whispers suggesting its true origin might be the U.S. Department of Defense’s intelligence arm, the NSA. This isn’t a new narrative, but we’ll dive into its prior emergence shortly. For now, it’s worth noting this theory, along with the …",

          "description": "Throughout the years, I have presented the case for Bitcoin to a lot of people from a wide range of backgrounds. The list includes curious cab drivers, financial advisors, young software developers, skeptical policymakers, voiceless activists, and once even an IMF employee. \nNeedless to say, most of these attempts ended up falling on deaf ears. So I started asking myself “why would this person in front of me care about Bitcoin?” and immediately realized that getting a response was particularly challenging because—even among Bitcoiners—there is no common understanding of what Bitcoin is in the first place. Is it “peer-to-peer electronic cash” as Satoshi originally defined it? Or should we consider it as “digital property” as Michael Saylor suggests? Or maybe listen to Gary Gensler and defin…",

          "description": "After being the victim of a red wave on Thursday, XRP rebounded in today’s session, as crypto bulls remained resilient. The global market cap is up by 0.40% at the time of writing, following a 2% drop yesterday. Stellar was another strong mover on Friday, and is currently up 2.25% \n \nXRP\n \n\n \nXRP was back in the green on Friday, after bulls abruptly ended a three-day win streak during yesterday’s session.\n \n\n \nFollowing a low at $0.5025 on Thursday, XRP/USD moved to a peak at $0.5134 earlier in the day.\n \n\n \nThe surge saw XRP, formerly ripple, once again make strides towards a key resistance level at $0.5450.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) climbed back above a ceiling at 47.00.\n \n\n \nAt present, price strength is now sitting at 48.72, with the next visible ceiling near the 54.00 region.\n \n\n \nIn the event this target is hit, there is a strong likelihood that XRP moves above $0.5400.\n \n\n \n\n \nStellar (XLM)\n \n\n \nStellar (XLM) was also in the green in today’s session, after two consecutive days of price declines.\n \n\n \nXLM/USD peaked at $0.1154 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a low of $0.1122.\n \n\n \nAs a result of the decline, bulls continued to push the token away from a recent floor at $0.1100, and back on course toward resistance at $0.1320.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nToday’s rebound was helped by the RSI reaching a floor of its own at 37.00, and it is now tracking at 39.87.\n \n\n \nA ceiling at 44.00 now awaits bulls, and could be the main hurdle preventing further gains this weekend.\n \n\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \n\n \nWhere will stellar end this weekend?
