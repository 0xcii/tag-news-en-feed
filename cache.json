          "description": "In a recent report released on Tuesday, undisclosed sources detailed that the firm behind the top stablecoin in market cap, tether (USDT), is now banking with Britannia Bank & Trust. In the past month, tether’s supply has dipped by 1.3%, leaving 82.85 billion USDT in circulation.\n \nUndisclosed Sources Say Tether Is Working With a Privately Held Bahamas-Based Bank\n \nOn August 29, Bloomberg journalists Yueqi Yang and Olga Kharif spotlighted Tether’s new partnership with the privately held Bahamas-based Britannia Bank & Trust for its banking services. The timeline of when Tether teamed up with Britannia remains hazy, but insiders revealed that the stablecoin giant is guiding its clientele to transfer funds to the bank’s Bahamian account number.\n \nThis revelation surfaces amidst challenges cryptocurrency firms face in clinching banking affiliations within the U.S., especially after the monumental downfall of three major U.S. banks last March – one of the most significant financial tremors in the nation’s history. Yang and Kharif shared that both Tether and Britannia declined to comment on the matter. Currently, tether boasts a market cap slightly surpassing $82 billion, with recent data highlighting a 1.3% drop in its reservoir.\n \n \nIn the latest 24-hour snapshot, USDT dominated the crypto trading scene, amassing an impressive $40.18 billion in global trade volume out of the $72.42 billion aggregate. This update is hot on the heels of Tether’s announcement to cease support for three blockchains: Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash, and Kusama.\n \nWhat do you think about Tether using a new banking partner?

While this did not result in GBTC automatically being converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, this victory was a big step towards the approval of one in the future. \n \"The appeals court found the SEC to be arbitrary and capricious in its denial oder of GBTC's conversion into an ETF and vacated the decision,\" the analysts continued. \"The written opinion from Judge Neomi Rao repudiated virtually every argument made by the SEC when comparing the Bitcoin spot and futures markets.\" \nA SEC decision on multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs is due by the end of this week, with many believing the applications will be further delayed as these so close to the Grayscale court outcome that just happened. Although, Balchunas said he's \"not sure timelines will matter as much in this situation,\" and that what is more likely is that eventually the SEC will give in and approve an imminent launch. \n \n         \n         \n         \n        \nJames Seyffart",
