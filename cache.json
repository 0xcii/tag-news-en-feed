The ban follows an announcement on June 15 revealing that the exchange’s funds, totaling over $1.7 million, were seized.\n \nThe seizure was conducted due to allegations of CoinEx’s failure to register as a securities and commodities brokerage, as required by regulation in the United States. A proposed settlement was recently filed in a New York state court in Manhattan, awaiting the judge’s approval.\n \n \nThe settlement outlines the terms and conditions for CoinEx, the Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange.

          "description": "BlackRock, the worlds largest asset manager, has filed an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund). \nIn their pursuit of a Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock has chosen Coinbase Custody as their trusted custodial solution. The proposed ETF will be benchmarked against indices provided by CF Benchmarks. The indices will be comprised of price data from six exchanges: Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Bitstamp, itBit, and LMAX Digital.\nIt is worth noting that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulatory authority responsible for overseeing ETFs in the United States, has thus far rejected every application for a spot bitcoin ETF. Nevertheless, the commission has granted approval for several bitcoin futures ETFs, which have been successfully introduced for trading.\nBlackRock's filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF signals a turning point in the industry, as a prominent player in the traditional financial space acknowledges the potential of Bitcoin. If approved, the Bitcoin ETF would open doors to a new wave of adoption and provide investors with an unprecedented opportunity to participate in the Bitcoin market through a regulated and accessible investment vehicle.",
