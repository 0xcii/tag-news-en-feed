Following a move to a five-month high on Thursday, prices were once again below $23,000. Ethereum also slipped, moving below $1,600 in the process.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) fell back below $23,000 on Friday, as markets consolidated ahead of U.S. consumer sentiment data.\n \nBTC/USD slipped to a bottom of $22,654.59 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $23,215.00.\n \nThe drop came ahead of this afternoon’s U.S. consumer sentiment report, which is expected to come in at a reading of 64.6.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) also edged closer to a floor of 78.00, leading to a slight shift in momentum.\n \nThe 10-day (red) moving average continues to move in an upward direction, however should the index move below 78.00, this trend will likely reverse.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 79.64, with BTC/USD trading at $22,965.60.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nThere was a slight shift in sentiment in ethereum (ETH), with prices moving below $1,600 during today’s session.\n \nFollowing a high of $1,619.45 on Thursday, ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,565.25 earlier in the day.\n \nToday’s move came as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency was unable to break out of a resistance level of $1,640 on Wednesday.\n \n \nSince this time, prices have moved to lower lows in back-to-back sessions, with ethereum’s RSI also dropping below a key point of support.\n \nThe index is tracking at 61.94, which is marginally under its recent floor at 63.00, and its weakest level since January 8.\n \nShould this bearish trend continue into the weekend, there is a strong possibility that ETH will hit a floor at $1,500.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill today’s data send cryptocurrencies higher?
