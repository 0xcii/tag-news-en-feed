          "description": "A report has revealed how integrating Bitcoin mining into solar storage systems can improve the scalability and reliability of grids.\n \nBitcoin Mining’s Properties Mean That It Goes Well With Solar Power Systems\n \nThere are many challenges that come with solar-based systems that arise out of the nature of the energy and the state of the current storage technology. As solar energy can fluctuate due to weather and other reasons, storage is necessary to establish some reliable output. However, large-scale storage can be very expensive.\n \nThis can make it difficult to scale solar to large systems without also losing profitability at the same time. There is also the problem that the energy demands of an area can sometimes wildly fluctuate, so the plant may produce large amounts of excess energy…",
