          "description": "In recent developments, Electricite du Laos (EDL) announced on August 24 that the power company shut down cryptocurrency mining activities. This decision came after this summer’s unprecedented heat surge escalated electricity demands. Furthermore, these mining operations have reportedly been defaulting on their debts.\n \nLaos’ Crypto Mining Grinds to a Halt Amid Energy Crisis\n \nSituated in Southeast Asia, Laos, surrounded by nations like Myanmar, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand, has reportedly halted its crypto mining. Interestingly, Laos relies on hydropower for a significant 95% of the country’s electricity generation.\n \nOver the first half of 2023, EDL’s hydropower stations have been overwhelmed with electricity consumption. The scorching heat is a major factor driving this soaring demand. But that’s not all; the Laos government states that regional mining activities haven’t cleared their dues. Notably, Laos has been increasingly open to cryptocurrency operations since 2021.\n \nAs highlighted by Vietnam Plus, back in September 2021, the Laotian government green-lighted six companies to dive into crypto mining and trading. Fast forward to January 2022, the Bank of Laos endorsed two crypto trading platforms, Lao Digital Assets Exchange (LDX) and Bitqik, setting them apart as the nation’s sole regulated entities offering comprehensive cryptocurrency services.\n \n \nBy May 2022, Laos inaugurated a dedicated cryptocurrency mining venture in its Champasack Province. This landmark event was spearheaded by Lao Crypto Mining in collaboration with AIF Group. As of August 2022, projections showed Laos raking in nearly $190 million in tax revenues from crypto-related operations by year’s end. However, the recent shutdown report leaves us in the dark about its duration and the outstanding amount owed by the mining businesses.\n \nWhat do you think about the mining shutdown in Laos?

However, pro-XRP legal expert Fred Rispoli has outlined why this is unlikely.\n \nSEC Unlikely To Sue Ripple Founders\n \nRispoli stated in a tweet that the SEC is unlikely to pursue a trial against Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen for “many reasons.” \n \n \n \n \nThe agency had accused Ripple Labs of selling unregistered securities back in 2020. But although it highlighted Garlinghouse and Larsen as integral to the wrongdoing, it never brought an action specifically against the duo.\n \nIt is not unusual for the SEC to bring actions against top executives whenever it files a suit aga…",

Speaking at the annual Jackson Hole symposium, Powell hinted that more hikes were in the cards. Ethereum moved back towards a recent support point.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin continued to trade near the $26,000 region to start the weekend, as markets failed to react to Jerome Powell’s comments at the Jackson Hole symposium.\n \nPowell stated that, “We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”\n \nBTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $25,914.93 on the comments, following Friday’s high at $26,406.15.\n \n \nPrice has since moved back above $26,000, as the relative strength index (RSI) began to trend sideways.\n \nAs of writing, price strength is now tracking at 25.71, which is closer to a ceiling of 29.00 than a floor of 20.00.\n \nShould the index move beyond the 29.00 level, there could be more bulls reentering the market.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) edged lower on Saturday, as traders were underwhelmed by yesterday’s speech by the Fed chair.\n \nFollowing a peak at $1,665.14 during yesterday’s session, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,641.63 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of the decline, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moved below a support point of $1,650.\n \n \nThis week has seen ETH mostly trade between a low of $1,580 and a high of $1,690, with some occasional breakouts.\n \nFor bulls, a surge will need to occur at the resistance level of 33.00 on the RSI, in order for momentum to truly shift upward.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat is behind the recent market consolidation?
