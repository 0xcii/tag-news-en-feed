This move comes as Blackburn's campaign recently launched a page dedicated to Bitcoin donations.\n“Our campaign is committed to meeting supporters where they are,” said Senator Blackburn. “As a growing number of Americans utilize digital currencies for everyday transactions, we are excited to take this next step and stay on the cutting edge of the 21st-century digital world.”\nThis announcement follows a recent trend of Bitcoin adoption among U.S. politicians. Just yesterday, Blackburn chaired the RNC Platform Committee that passed their 2024 platform draft, committing to defend the right to mine and self-custody Bitcoin. Congressman Matt Gaetz recently introduced a bill allowing federal income tax payments in Bitcoin. Additionally, former President Donald Trump also started accepting Bitcoin Lightning payments for campaign donations.\nEarlier this year, Senator Blackburn told Bitcoin Magazine that the freedom and privacy aspects of Bitcoin are a \"very good thing\", while advocating strongly against central bank digital currencies (CBDC), saying they are spy tools for the government to use against their citizens.\n\nNEW – US Senator Marsha Blackburn: CBDCs are a \"spy tool\" for government control.#Bitcoin is a \"very good thing.\" 👏 pic.twitter.com/A7ahH4tMfn\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 16, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nSenator Blackburn is also set to speak at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville at the end of the month, further signaling her support for Bitcoin.\n\nANNOUNCEMENT: United States Senator @MarshaBlackburn will be speaking at Bitcoin 2024! 🇺🇸🏛 pic.twitter.com/twABgJMyGh\n— The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 30, 2024",

The new ETF will begin trading on July 12th under the ticker BTXX.\nThis comes just weeks after the ASX approved its first Bitcoin ETF in June when it listed the VanEck Bitcoin ETF. The moves follow the successful debut of several Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. beginning in early 2024.\nAustralia has been building momentum in Bitcoin ETFs over the past year. The country's first spot Bitcoin ETF, the 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (EBTC), launched in April 2022 and trades on the Cboe Australia exchange.\nMost recently, in June, the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) also began trading on the Cboe. Now, ASX is following suit by approving its second Bitcoin ETF after VanEck's product became the first last month.\nThe flurry of new Bitcoin investment vehicles hitting the Australian market reflects the growing interest in Bitcoin exposure. Investors are increasingly looking to gain Bitcoin exposure through regulated fund structures rather than direct ownership.\nETFs provide an easy avenue to invest in the asset class without needing to custody Bitcoin directly. Many expect more countries to approve Bitcoin ETFs as the instruments gain traction and regulatory acceptance expands.\nBy greenlighting another Bitcoin ETF, Australia's main securities exchange demonstrates a favourable shift in attitudes toward Bitcoin assets within one of the world's top financial markets.",
