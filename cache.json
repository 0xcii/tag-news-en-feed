The global crypto market cap is 2.28% higher as of writing, as markets prepared for the release of U.S. consumer sentiment data. Quant was another big mover, as prices surged for a second straight day.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) was a notable mover on Friday, as the token surged to its highest point since Monday.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.9062 on Thursday, MATIC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.9324 earlier today.\n \nAs a result of this, the token moved closer to a key resistance level of $0.9540, which was last hit December 4.\n \n \nWhilst prices near a ceiling, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has also moved towards its own point of support at 53.00.\n \nThe 10-day (red) moving average is also trending higher, with it remaining above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nDespite recent turbulence, this is a sign of bullish momentum in the market, with some expecting further surges in price this weekend\n \n \nQuant (QNT)\n \nQuant (QNT) was another token to surge on Friday, with prices rising for a second straight session.\n \nQNT/USD moved to a high of $124.88 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after hitting a bottom at $120.70.\n \nToday’s move sent QNT past a recent resistance point at $122.00, with bulls now appearing to take price to a higher ceiling.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, this point of resistance seems to be the $132.00 mark, which is where quant started the week.\n \nIn order to recapture this mark, QNT bulls will first need to overcome the upcoming resistance on the RSI of 52.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould we see quant hit this point over the weekend?
