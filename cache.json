The agreement will see the token made available to over 800 million Telegram Wallet users. Stellar, on the other hand, was significantly lower, falling by nearly 8% today.\n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin (TON) was one of today’s biggest movers, as markets were buoyed by the news that it was partnering with Telegram.\n \nFollowing a low of $1.73 on Tuesday, TON/USD rose to an intraday peak of $1.95 earlier in the day.\n \nThis surge resulted in toncoin rising by as much as 13%, nearing a recent high of $2.05 in the process.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the move led to the relative strength index (RSI) colliding with a ceiling at the 66.00 level.\n \nEarlier gains have since faded as a result of a failed breakout beyond this point, leading to TON now trading at $1.93.\n \nIn order to move above $2.00, the aforementioned ceiling on the RSI must first be broken.\n \n \nStellar (XLM)\n \nOn the other side of the spectrum was stellar (XLM), which dropped by over 8% in today’s session.\n \nXLM/USD bottomed out at $0.1195 on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after residing at a high of $0.1318.\n \nThis drop in price sees the token fall for a third consecutive day, falling below a floor at $0.1200 in the process.\n \n \nIt appears that today’s sell-off coincided with the RSI failing to remain above a point of support at 49.00.\n \nPrice strength is now tracking at 44.53, with the next visible zone of stability around the 37.00 region.\n \nIn the event that this level is reached, XLM will likely be trading under $0.1100.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill stellar continue to edge lower this week?
