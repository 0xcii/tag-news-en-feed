The ETF will seek to deliver 175% of MicroStrategy's stock's daily return.\n\nJUST IN: 🇺🇸 SEC approves the first leverage long MicroStrategy ETF. pic.twitter.com/9NYrLh81sD\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 15, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nMSTX is issued by Defiance ETFs, which focuses on thematic and leveraged ETFs. According to Defiance CEO Sylvia Jablonski, the leveraged MicroStrategy ETF offers amplified exposure to Bitcoin since MicroStrategy is one of the largest corporate holders.\nAs of Q2 2024, MicroStrategy held about 226,500 Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The company took on debt to acquire most of its Bitcoin, making the stock a leveraged Bitcoin play in itself.\nJablonski said, \"Given MicroStrategy's inherent higher beta compared to bitcoin, MSTX offers a unique opportunity for investors to maximize their leverage exposure to the Bitcoin market within an ETF wrapper.\"\nLeveraged ETFs pursue daily investment objectives, meaning performance is amplified daily but varies over longer periods. MSTX carries added risks from using leverage and concentration in a single stock.\nSenior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas, commented on X that a leveraged MicroStrategy ETF \"will be the most volatile ETF you can get in the US market.\"\nThe SEC has recently allowed leveraged single-stock ETFs after years of rejecting proposals. GraniteShares and Direxion also have approval for 3x leveraged Tesla and Apple ETFs, respectively. However, leveraged equity ETFs remain a small niche, accounting for less than 1% of overall ETF assets.\nDefiance hopes MSTX can break out from the pack with the Bitcoin link. But the first-of-its-kind ETF's ultimate success will depend on investor reception and MicroStrategy's performance as a Bitcoin proxy.",

This latest acquisition expands Marathon's corporate bitcoin treasury to over 25,000 BTC.\n\nJUST IN: 🇺🇸 Marathon Digital Holdings buys 4144 #Bitcoin worth $249 million.\n pic.twitter.com/PnMm9RLuev\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 14, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nOn August 12th, Marathon announced a $250 million convertible note offering to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. The notes were met with strong demand, allowing Marathon to upsize the deal to $300 million.\nThe company then used $249 million of the proceeds to accumulate 4,144 additional Bitcoin at an average price of $59,500 per Bitcoin. This boosts Marathon's Bitcoin reserves to over 25,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion.\nIn July, Marathon bought $100 million of Bitcoin on the open market as part of its long-term \"hodl\" strategy. The Nasdaq-listed miner aims to hold newly mined coins rather than sell them.\nMarathon is aggressively expanding its Bitcoin stash by mimicking MicroStrategy's corporate playbook. Other firms, such as Semler Scientific and Metaplanet, are also raising money in debt markets to buy more Bitcoin and ride its adoption curve. \nThese savvy public companies are using the fiat system's cheap lending rates to accumulate scarce Bitcoin. This demonstrates Bitcoin's growing conviction that it is the best strategic reserve asset for public companies.",
