It’s now a hotly debated election issue, dividing the electorate and promising to bring the industry to new heights. And we’re not just talking about the US elections and Trump’s pro-crypto stance; digital currency as an election issue has spilled over to Japan, where it’s scheduled to hold its general elections this October 27th.\n \n \nYuichiro Tamaki, the leader of the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), has recently promised tax cuts and reforms as part of the party’s efforts to shore up support.
