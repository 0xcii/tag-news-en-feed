Originally linked to cryptocurrencies, DeFi has now grown beyond just digital money. It has become a game-changer by including real-world assets in its scope.\nThe journey of DeFi is fascinating, reflecting how blockchain tech has matured and how people are starting to realize it can shake up regular money systems.

Each week on Saturday mornings, Jews come together to read a weekly portion of the Torah (Old testament) to learn about the tenets of living in harmony with Jewish ethics. One of these principles is the ban on taking interest on a loan. The ban is mentioned in the weekly Torah reading Ki Tzei.\nBitcoin = the protocol and payment network.\nbitcoin = the currency.\nThe Ban On Interest\nInitially challenging for modern investors to comprehend, the ban on interest is rooted in severe consequences for non-payment in pre-biblical times, often leading to debt bondage and enslavement of the debtor and their family.
