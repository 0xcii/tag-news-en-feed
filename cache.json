As of December 21, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain boasts over 50 million inscriptions.\n \nOn Wednesday, Phantom, the Web3 wallet that secured $109 million in Series B funding from key investors last year, announced its foray into the Bitcoin realm. Phantom acknowledges Bitcoin’s foundational role, stating that without it, there would be no Solana, Ethereum, or Web3.\n \n“Introducing Bitcoin on Phantom,” the company said in a post shared on X. “You can now buy, sell, trade, transfer, and HODL Bitcoin, Ordinals, and BRC20 tokens with your favorite multi-chain wallet.”\n \n \nPhantom’s integration of Ordinals and BRC20s coincides with a surge in demand for Bitcoin digital collectibles and fungible tokens. Recent data from cryptoslam.io reveals that Bitcoin-based NFT sales have exceeded $400 million in the past week.\n \nPhantom’s Bitcoin feature is currently in beta and available on an opt-in basis. Users can also link with the NFT marketplaces Magic Eden and Unisat, and Phantom indicates that additional “trusted” applications will be introduced shortly.\n \nWhat do you think about Phantom supporting Bitcoin, Ordinals, and BRC20 tokens?

          "description": "In a groundbreaking statement, Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Diana Mondino, has confirmed the country's stance on embracing Bitcoin for contractual agreements.\n\n\n\nMondino's declaration outlined the government's willingness to accept and formalize contracts denominated in Bitcoin, heralding a pivotal moment for legal recognition of BTC within Argentina. The move demonstrates Argentina's progressive approach towards integrating Bitcoin in the country.\n\"And also any other crypto and/or species such as kilos of steer or liters of milk,\" Mondino continued. \"Art 766. - Obligation of the debtor. The debtor must deliver the corresponding amount of the designated currency, whether the currency is legal tender in the Republic or not.\"\nThis announcement arrives a month after Javier Milei, who has made very positive comments about Bitcoin in the past, won Argentina's presidential candidacy. Milei has previously stated, \"The central bank is a scam, a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax.” Then saying Bitcoin \"represents the return of money to its original creator, the private sector,” and that \"it prevents politicians from robbing you through inflation.\"\nThe Minister's assertion further underlines Argentina's efforts to leverage the potential of Bitcoin to stimulate economic growth and innovation. By accepting Bitcoin as a valid form of contractual agreement, the government aims to foster an environment conducive to investment and business development within the country.\nWhile the details regarding the implementation and legal nuances remain to be outlined, Mondino's statement marks a crucial step forward in legitimizing Bitcoin as a recognized means of conducting formal agreements within Argentina. The move may also serve as a catalyst, encouraging other nations to consider similar initiatives in integrating Bitcoin into their legal frameworks.",
