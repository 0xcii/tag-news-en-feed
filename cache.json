The data, which is for February, is expected to show a slight increase in confidence for the month. This will likely result in the Federal Reserve maintaining its rate hike policy next month.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) fell for a second straight session on Tuesday, as prices flirted with a breakout below $23,000.\n \nBTC/USD moved to an intraday low of $23,205.88 earlier in today’s session, which comes less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $23,857.89.\n \nThe move comes after bulls were unable to jump back above the $24,000 mark on Monday, with bears using this as an opportunity to reenter.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also failed to break out of a resistance of its own at 53.00\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is trading at 52.46, with bitcoin slightly higher than its earlier low.\n \nBTC is now trading at $23,466.92, with a move back towards $23,800 still on the cards.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also stuttered in today’s session, with prices moving close to the $1,600 level.\n \nFollowing a high of $1,662.58 to start the week, ETH/USD fell to a bottom of $1,615.39 earlier in the day.\n \nThis recent decline comes after a failed attempt to move past a long-term resistance level of $1,675.\n \n \nAdditionally, price strength has also hit a ceiling at the 53.00 mark, with the index tracking at 52.74.\n \nUltimately this consolidation, which is almost identical to bitcoin’s, comes as markets wait for this afternoon’s consumer confidence report, before deciding which direction to take.\n \nHowever, should ETH bulls break the 53.00 ceiling on the RSI, there is a good chance that price could be heading to or above $1,700.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect US consumer confidence to rise this month?
