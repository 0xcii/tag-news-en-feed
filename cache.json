The crypto exchange said it will offer these services via its Money Doc (Proprietary) Limited, which acts as Bybit’s “juristic representative.”\n \nIn a statement, the crypto exchange revealed that Money Doc is an authorized financial services provider and a registered South African company. As reported by Bitcoin.com News almost a year ago, crypto asset service providers operating in South Africa must have a financial product service provider license from regulators.\n \n\n \nBybit meanwhile said its on-ramp service will enable users to deposit the rand currency (ZAR) via bank transfers. Commenting on the crypto exchange’s entry into the South African market, Joshua Yau, the regional manager for Africa, said:\n \n“This marks a significant milestone for Bybit as we bring access to global leading products to the passionate crypto community in South Africa in line with regulatory requirements. This marks an important step in our compliance efforts. We are committed to providing a secure and seamless trading experience, industry-leading trading tools, and low-cost access that empower our users.”\n \nBen Zhou, the founder and CEO of Bybit, characterized the incursion into South Africa as the latest testimony of the crypto exchange’s commitment to its goal of making crypto trading accessible to all.\n \nRegister your email here to get a weekly update on African news sent to your inbox:\n \n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
