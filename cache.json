The sell-off appears more sustained compared to previous brief dips, with most BTC downside liquidations concentrated around $66,000. ETFs witness $132 million inflows, sparking predictions of a potential liquidity crisis within six months. VanEck suggests that an ETH ETF could surpass BTC in size. Grayscale's ETH discount doubles within a week. Meanwhile, SOL's market cap reaches an all-time high amid a frenzy surrounding memecoins.

          "description": "Sam Bankman-Fried, the Founder and former CEO of the collapsed FTX, has challenged his conviction and sentencing for conspiracy and fraud by filing an appeal in court yesterday (Thursday). The appeal was filed just hours before the deadline.\nSBF Appealed\nEarlier, the judge had ordered Bankman-Fried to be remanded to a low or medium-security prison in Northern California. This facility is near his parents’ house, and the judge cited concerns for his security at a maximum-security prison due to his autism. Interestingly, during his trial and while awaiting sentencing, Bankman-Fried had requested to be kept in the notorious Manhattan Detention Center. Previously, he was an inmate at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.\nThe appeal came two weeks after a US court sentenced him to 25 years in prison, along with three years of supervised release. He is also required to forfeit $11 billion.\nBillionaire to Convict\nBankman-Fried was once regarded as the messiah of the cryptocurrency world, known for his altruistic vision, signature T-shirt, and shorts outfit. He became one of the youngest self-made billionaires through his FTX empire, which collapsed overnight following the discovery of his dubious business practices.\nAfter a high-profile trial, Bankman-Fried was convicted last November on multiple charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. Although the total maximum prison time for all the convictions could amount to 115 years, the prosecutors were seeking 40 to 50 years. Bankman-Fried’s legal team requested six-and-a-half years, but the court ultimately sentenced him to 25 years.\nDuring the trial, several close associates of Bankman-Fried testified against him. They all pleaded guilty to their roles in the shady operations at FTX and are now awaiting sentencing.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.",

This metric correlates with the network’s security.\n \nTo perform a successful 51% attack on the network, bad actors must gain control over at least 51% of the online mining rigs. When the hashrate goes up, the security naturally strengthens, as there are now more machines that an attacker needs to succeed.\n \n \nOf course, this is only true if the new power being added to the network is properly decentralized.

Interestingly, DOGE has yet to have a tangible breakout above the $0.2 mark since March 31. In fact, the crypto went on a decline in the first week of April to reach as low as $0.1719. \n \nDespite having reversed some of this decline at the time of writing, Dogecoin has yet to perform as many investors would expect. Furthermore, chart formation shows the cryptocurrency could be stuck in a bearish pattern and on-chain data indicates whales are selling their DOGE holdings. At the same time, short-term holders have seen their holdings increase, which makes them vulnerable to selloffs.\n \nDogecoin Whales Are Selling\n \nAccording to data from the on-cha…",
