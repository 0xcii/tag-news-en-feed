The statement reads:\n \n\nWe are aware some users may experience increased latency across http://Coinbase.com and a few users may see intermittent zero balance. Rest assured, your funds are safe. Our team is investigating this issue and will provide an update. Trading is not impacted at this time.\n \nIntermittent Technical Issues\n \nThe recent surge in market activity and prevailing bullish sentiment has significantly strained Coinbase’s infrastructure, resulting in intermittent technical issues. \n \n \nTraders and investors flocking to the platform to take advantage of the market’s positive momentum may have overwhelmed the exchange’s servers, causing some users to experience latency and intermittent zero balance issues.\n \n \nHowever, nothing is certain as there has been no further official statement from the exchange’s support account or Coinbase executives as of this writing.\n \n \nCurrently, the exchange stock, listed under the ticker name COIN, is trading at $226. This marks a significant increase of over 10% in the past 24 hours. The surge in price comes as Bitcoin spot ETFs gain traction in the market and Bitcoin itself moves closer to its previous all-time high of $69,000.\n \nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",
