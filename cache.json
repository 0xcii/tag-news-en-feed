USD/JPY rose to a one-month high, with the greenback also gaining against the euro and British pound. Ethereum was also lower, falling below $2,100.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $30,000 mark on Monday, as a strong U.S. dollar weakened cryptocurrency markets.\n \nBTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $29,816.72, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $30,555.54.\n \nMonday’s price slippage comes two days after bitcoin rose above $31,000 for the first time since June 7.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nUltimately, this recent bull run pushed BTC into overbought territory, with the relative strength index (RSI) hitting a ceiling of 71.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 63.45, with a floor at the 59.00 mark potentially approaching.\n \nShould price strength continue to move towards this level, there is a good chance that BTC will move below a floor at $29,600.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) mostly consolidated to start the week, as price moved below the $2,100 mark on Monday.\n \nFollowing a high of $2,137.45 on Sunday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $2,076.18 earlier in today’s session.\n \nMonday’s decline sees the world’s second largest cryptocurrency drop from a recent 11-month high.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nSimilar to bitcoin, this decline coincided with the 14-day RSI failing to break out of a ceiling, and in this instance it was at the 75.00 mark.\n \nDespite this, ETH remains close to the $2,100 mark, helped by the fact the index is still above its floor at 69.00\n \nIf this point of support were to break, then bears would likely reenter the market.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould ethereum fall below $2,000 this week?
