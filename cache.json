The filings reveal names like the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and others.\nNow, the latest disclosure shows mammoth financial services firm Morgan Stanley has bought $269.9 million worth of Grayscale's GBTC. This makes Morgan Stanley one of the largest institutional holders of GBTC, besides Susquehanna's $1.8 billion position.\n\nNEW: $1.5 Trillion Morgan Stanley reveals it has spot #Bitcoin ETF exposure in SEC filings 👀 pic.twitter.com/tRAznuHHRF\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 17, 2024\n \n \n \nWith over $1.5 trillion in assets under management, this allocation signals the Wall Street titan's growing conviction in bitcoin's role in portfolios. \nIt joins other major banks like JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, and Royal Bank of Canada that have disclosed spot Bitcoin ETF purchases.\nDespite some firms like Vanguard opposing Bitcoin, the broader shift has been toward embracing Bitcoin exposure. Clients are demanding access to Bitcoin's growth prospects as both an inflation hedge and an alternative asset class.\n \n                         \n                         \n                        Click the image to learn more. \n                     \n                    \nOld guard banks steadily allocating to Bitcoin ETFs represents a monumental change. Morgan Stanley's purchase follows execs speaking positively about Bitcoin's potential.
