The Soviet Union vied for superiority during the Cold War but ultimately failed as it lost control of its satellite states. This was evident when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. \nIn recent years, American hegemony has been challenged by China, a nation which has accumulated tremendous wealth since opening up its economy to the world.
