Miners can choose between these three templates at this time: \n\nThe default OCEAN Knots template, which filters out any inscription transaction, as well as places an additional OP_RETURN limitation of a maximum of 42 bytes on transactions using OP_RETURN. \nBitcoin Core patched with the Ordisrespector update, filtering out inscription transactions. \nThe default Bitcoin Core template which implements no additional transaction filters at all. \n\nThis new option is a stepping stone towards their ultimate goal of enabling Stratum v2 in order to allow any miner using the pool to construct whatever block template they wish to while mining with the…",
