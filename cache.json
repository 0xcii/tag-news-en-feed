          "description": "Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

The global crypto market cap was up by nearly 1% earlier in the day, as Tuesday’s losses eased. Solana, on the other hand, remained lower, as it fell towards a key price floor.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) edged higher on Wednesday, as the token moved away from a recent point of support.\n \nFollowing a low at $0.954 on Tuesday, MATIC/USD jumped to a peak of $0.9925 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of the move, polygon bounced from a recent price floor of $0.950, after recently falling to a multi-week low.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, Wednesday’s surge led to the relative strength index (RSI) colliding with a long-term ceiling of 40.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 39.22, with MATIC at a level of $0.9813.\n \nDespite earlier gains easing, there is still optimism that polygon could climb back above $1.00 this week.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nOn the other hand, solana (SOL) remained in the red, as the token moved back towards a recent price floor.\n \nSOL/USD retreated to a low of $21.36 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after the token traded at a high of $22.37.\n \nWednesday’s drop in price has sent SOL close to its long-term support point at $21.00, which was last hit a week ago.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that today’s decline came as the RSI made a move for its own floor at 45.00\n \nAs of writing, price strength is tracking at 45.17, with bears likely to push for a breakout in the coming hours.\n \nShould this occur, there is a chance that SOL could move closer to $20.00 in the coming days.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo yo expect solana to hit $20.00 this week?
