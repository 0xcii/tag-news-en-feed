Like other entities on the blockchain, DeFi is public and doesn’t involve any centralized party to get things done (as transactions are peer-to-peer).\n \nThe “total value locked” (TVL) is a metric that measures the total amount of capital that has currently been deposited by users in DeFi protocols.
