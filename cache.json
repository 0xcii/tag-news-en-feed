          "description": "Despite Bitcoin's decline, several alternative cryptocurrencies remain robust. Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness a $94 million outflow, although outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may decelerate. Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase's premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin's all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance. Solana's (SOL) decentralized exchange (DEX) achieves a monthly volume of $50 billion, with revenue soaring 30-fold. OKX announces support for a new Solana token standard. Despite expectations, Layer 2 activity remains sluggish post-Dencun, according to Vitalik Buterin.",

He highlighted that the crypto community desires a broader range of crypto products from BlackRock, but the company's focus remains on Bitcoin.\n\n🚨NEW: @BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets Robert Mitchnick addresses how the asset manager is thinking about other #crypto products: \n“For our clients, Bitcoin is overwhelmingly the number one priority. And then a little bit ethereum, and very little everything else.” \nHe says…\n— Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 22, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nRegarding the future of Bitcoin on Wall Street, Mitchnick expressed optimism about a convergence between traditional finance and new technological advancements, stating, “Eventually we expect there will be a convergence where the best of the old system and the new technology will become fused into a new infrastructure system in finance.”\nEarlier this year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved a batch of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), including BlackRock's application. Since then, their ETF has gone on to be one of the most successful ETF launches in history. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF $IBIT has seen net inflows for the last 49 days straight, something only 30 other ETFs have ever done, according to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\n$IBIT and $FBTC have now taken in cash for 49 straight days, something only 30 other ETFs have ever done (and none of them did it right out of gate).

          "description": "A newly identified vulnerability in Apple’s M-series processors could have dire implications for crypto users, with the potential to compromise the private keys essential for securing digital assets. This flaw, which resides deep within the microarchitecture of these chips, was first reported by Ars Technica and detailed in a paper published by a collective of researchers from top US universities.\n \nMac Users Beware: This Is Crucial For Crypto Owners\n \nThe vulnerability stems from a side channel in the chip’s data memory-dependent prefetcher (DMP), a mechanism designed to enhance computing efficiency. However, this feature inadvertently allows for the extraction of secret keys during cryptographic operations, a process that is fundamental to the security of cryptocurrencies and other digit…",

When you take self-custody of your own Bitcoin, you and only you are responsible for the safety of your funds. Self-custody also means that no one can freeze your funds, and no one can stop you from making a payment you want to make. It’s a double-edged sword: there are huge benefits to self-custody, but it also comes with responsibility.\nIf you make a mistake and send Bitcoin to the wrong address there is no undoing it. Then if someone can access your seed phrase (seed words), there is no customer support to help you, that person now has access to your money. If you lose your keys and your seed phrase backups, th…",
