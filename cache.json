Ethereum fell to a one-week low in today’s session.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) was once again in the red on Thursday, as traders continued to secure gains from last week’s bull run.\n \nBTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $28,596.91 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $29,509.35.\n \nThis is the lowest point that bitcoin has hit since April 10, when price traded at a bottom of around $28,100.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, Thursday’s move saw BTC fall under a recent floor at $28,600, with the relative strength index (RSI) also dropping toward a floor of its own.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 51.47, which is marginally above the aforementioned support at 50.00.\n \nBTC has already moved away from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $28,837.95, as of writing.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) slipped to a one-week low in today’s session, as traders attempted to find a point of support.\n \nFollowing a high of $2,005.44 on Wednesday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,928.58 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of this drop, ethereum fell to its weakest point since April 13, a day which saw ETH hover marginally above $1,900.\n \n \nAt the time of writing, ETH has rebounded, which appears to be due to its RSI bouncing from a floor at 52.00.\n \nEthereum is currently trading at $1,945.58, with the index at the 54.54 level, below an upcoming ceiling at 58.00.\n \nIf bulls were to take price strength to, or above, 58.00, there is a good chance that ETH will be back over the $2,000 level.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect ethereum to climb above $2,000 this week?
