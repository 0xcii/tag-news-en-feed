Users have until September 2 to purchase digital assets on the platform, and another one month to sell their crypto holdings. \nRevolut to  \nQuit US Crypto Market\nAccording  \nto CoinDesk, the challenger bank blamed the “difficult decision” on the  \n“evolving regulatory environment” in the United States. In recent months, the  \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has intensified its crackdown on  \n“crypto-asset securities” offered by “unregistered” trading platforms such as Binance and Coinbase. \nIn the lawsuit against  \nBinance filed in  \nearly June, the SEC listed 13 tokens, including Cardano’s ADA, Polygon’s MATIC,  \nand Solana’s SOL, as unregistered securities. The move forced several platforms including Revolut, Robinhood and eToro, to move towards delisting some of the tokens from their platforms. \nRevolut, which suspended the purchase of ADA, MATIC and SOL on its platform, initially gave its US users until September 18 to sell their holdings. With the deadline several weeks away, Revolut has decided to instead shut down its entire crypto services in the country.\nHowever,  \nRevolut in a statement shared with CoinDesk noted that its users from other regions are not affected by  \nthe decision. It emphasized that the move will impact less than 1% of  \nits crypto customers across the world.\n“This  \ndecision has not been taken lightly, and we understand the disappointment this  \nmay cause,” Revolut stated.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Solomon Oladipupo at www.financemagnates.com.",
