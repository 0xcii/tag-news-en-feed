          "description": "Bitcoin fell to a one-week low on Apr. 19, as markets moved into consolidation following a recent bull run. Following today’s red wave, prices neared a breakout below the $29,000 level earlier in the session. Ethereum also declined, falling below $2,000.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) moved lower on Wednesday, as markets began to consolidate following recent gains in price.\n \nFollowing a high of $30,470.30 on Tuesday, BTC/USD dropped to a bottom at the $29,102.17 mark earlier in the day.\n \nThe low sent bitcoin to its lowest point since April 10, which is when price was last below $29,000.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nOverall, it appears that today’s sell-off took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell below a floor at 59.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 54.97, with the next visible point of support at the 55.00 mark.\n \nShould this level be hit, there is a good chance that BTC will be trading around a floor at $28,600.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to BTC, Wednesday’s red wave also pushed ethereum (ETH) lower, with the price dropping below $2,000.\n \nETH/USD hit a low of $1,967.17 earlier today, which comes less than 24 hours after it traded at a peak of $2,121.53.\n \nThe move came as ethereum fell below its recent price floor at the $2,030 level, with some eyeing a lower floor at $1,830.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nUltimately, ETH was relatively overbought in recent days, with the RSI hitting a reading above 75.00 to start the week.\n \nThis led to bears reentering the market, which have now pushed price strength to a current reading at 55.00\n \nA floor at 51.00 could be the target for sellers, which would almost certainly see ETH trading under $1,900.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \n What is behind today’s red wave?
