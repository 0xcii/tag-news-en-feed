To the end, Robin Linus, the leader of ZeroSync, which is behind the development of a zk-proof light client for Bitcoin, unveiled the “BitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin” white paper yesterday. This paper presents a groundbreaking methodology that could potentially redefine the perception of Bitcoin’s capabilities.\n \nBitVM introduces a computing paradigm that can express Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts. The significance here is that it does not necessitate any modifications to the network’s consensus rules. Instead of executing computations directly on Bitcoin, these computations are merely verified, drawing parallels with the process of optimistic rollups.\n \nOnline forums, particularly the community on Reddit, have been buzzi…",
