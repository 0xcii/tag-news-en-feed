Over the past week, bitcoin has witnessed an 8.4% increase and a 3% rise in the past 24 hours, achieving a peak that the cryptocurrency hadn’t seen in 20 months.\n \nBitcoin Rises Above the $40K Zone\n \n\n \nBitcoin (BTC) reached a peak previously last observed in early April 2022, as its value per unit soared beyond the $40,000 threshold. The intraday trading saw the cryptocurrency’s price fluctuating from a low of $39,309 to a high of $40,846 per BTC. This surge in price brings bitcoin’s total market capitalization to $795.87 billion, accounting for 50% of the entire $1.593 trillion crypto economy.\n \n\n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSince the start of the year, BTC has experienced a remarkable 140% rise against the U.S. dollar, and in the past month alone, this leading cryptocurrency has increased by just over 49%. Currently, bitcoin boasts a global trade volume of $17.93 billion, with its primary trading pair at this moment being tether (USDT). Following tether, the top trading pairs for BTC include FDUSD, USD, USDC, and KRW.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nOn Sunday, the Korean won constitutes 4.88% of BTC’s total trade volume, with the cryptocurrency witnessing a ‘Kimchi premium‘ on exchanges such as Bithumb and Upbit. While BTC trades at $40,798, it’s being exchanged at a notably higher $42,249 on Bithumb. This represents a significant premium of $1,451 per unit compared to the global average price. Furthermore, following BTC’s surge past the $40K threshold, there was a liquidation of $77.95 million in BTC short positions as a direct response to the change in price.\n \n\n \nWhat are your thoughts on bitcoin’s rise on Sunday?

          "description": "November marked a significant milestone in the 2023 revenue generated by bitcoin miners, reaching a peak of $1.16 billion. This month not only stood out in terms of total earnings but also set a record for the highest monthly fees collected by miners within the year.\n \nBitcoin Mining Fees Soar to Yearly High in November, Fueling Revenue\n \n\n \nIn November, bitcoin (BTC) miners experienced a prosperous period, bolstered by increased prices and a substantial uptick in transfer fees. Data reveals that miners amassed a total revenue of $1.16 billion, with fees contributing $142.19 million to this sum.\n \n\n \nThis performance eclipsed the former zenith reached in May 2023, where total earnings were $919.22 million, inclusive of $125.92 million in fees. From May to November 2023, bitcoin miners experienced a fluctuation in earnings, with fees escalating from about $17 million to a peak of $38 million in June.\n \n\n \nThe total revenue in November surpassed May’s figures by approximately 26.19%. Yet, the hash price, defined as the revenue generated per petahash per second (PH/s) each day, was more favorable in early May compared to November’s peak values.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nOn May 8, 2023, data revealed that a single PH/s of hashpower was valued at $124.17. Contrastingly, the apex value in November, recorded on the 18th, was slightly lower at $96.36 per PH/s.\n \n\n \nNovember witnessed a marginal increase in bitcoin (BTC) transaction processing over May, with 16.42 million transactions in November slightly edging out May’s count of 16.3 million. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s onchain daily volume in USD terms reached notable heights in the past month, though it fell short of the year’s highest peak, which occurred on October 29, 2023.\n \n\n \nWhat do you think about miners recording the highest revenue month in 2023 in November?

This figure marks a significant rebound from the low of $36.39 billion recorded 46 days ago, on October 18. Over this period, the TVL in defi has experienced a robust growth of 34.40%. \n \nDefi TVL Set to Break $50 Billion Barrier\n \nIn recent times, the top ten defi protocols have shown remarkable performance, with the leading two liquid staking applications spearheading this growth. Lido, the frontrunner in defi protocols, witnessed a notable 20.17% surge in its 30-day metrics, while Makerdao experienced a 5.46% increase in the same timeframe.\n \n\n \nTron’s Justlend protocol enjoyed a 6.93% uptick, and Aave’s TVL climbed by 8.61%. Not to be outdone, Uniswap, ranking fifth in terms of TVL size, grew by 15.16% this month, closely followed by Summer Finance with an impressive 18.62% leap. The only exception in the top ten was STUSDT, which saw a marginal decline of 0.33% over the month.\n \nThe defi landscape also witnessed significant double-digit growth in Spark and Blast. However, Juststables encountered a 29.95% decrease in its TVL value over the last 30 days, and Tron’s SUN protocol also recorded a 23.77% reduction in the same period. As of Sunday, Ethereum dominates the defi space, holding 56.52% of all value, followed by Tron with 15.74%, and BSC with 6.13%. While Ethereum’s TVL rose by 26.48%, Tron’s saw a dip of 3.29% during the month.\n \nOther chains following BSC in the top ten TVL rankings include Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Solana, Avalanche, Cronos, and Base. Bitcoin secures the 11th spot in the ranking of the largest TVLs by blockchain.
