The “supply on exchanges” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating Shiba Inu supply that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.\n \nWhen the value of this metric goes down, it means that the investors are transferring a net number of coins from these platforms toward their self-custodial wallets right now.\n \n \nGenerally, the main reason why holders would shift their coins in this way is to hold onto them for extended periods.
