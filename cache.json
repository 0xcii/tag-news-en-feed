          "description": "As meme coins recovered from their 2023 lows, expectations for coins like Shiba Inu are rising, with price targets being set for $0.0001. Reaching this price level would be a new all-time high for SHIB, but there are a number of factors that will drive the growth needed to reach it.\n \nShiba Inu Needs Demand\n \nThe Shiba Inu price, as with other cryptocurrencies, is highly dependent on the demand to supply ratio. When there is more supply than demand, the price tends to suffer. However, when demand surpasses supply, it leads to a surge in price, which is why demand for the SHIB token is important.\n \n \nSome indicators of rising demand include a rise in the trading volume and in the last 24 hours, the SHIB daily trading volume is up over 33% to reach $2.1 billion.

This “Danger Zone” has historically coincided with sharp price corrections before Bitcoin halving events, raising concerns about a potential crash in the coming weeks.\n \nBitcoin Approaching “Danger Zone”\n \nAccording to price charts, Bitcoin is trading above $72,400 when writing. However, as time progresses, the coin is inching closer to the “Danger Zone.” Usually, when prices are at this region, as past price action shows, the coin tends to pull back sharply, unwinding gains. This area is time-based and takes place roughly two to four weeks before halving. \n \n \nThe network will halve its miner rewards in roughly 33 days in mid-April 2024.
