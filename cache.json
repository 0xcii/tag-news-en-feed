          "description": "Tony “The Bull,” a technical analyst and the Editorial Executive at NewsBTC, now thinks Ethereum (ETH), the second most valuable cryptocurrency, is about to explode. “The Bull” cites technical candlestick formation in the ETHUSDT daily chart as a leading indicator for ETH, a coin now trading above $3,000, the highest level over two years.\n \nIs Ethereum About To “Explode”? \nThe analyst pointed to the Bollinger Bands (BB), a technical indicator used to measure volatility. Though the BB is a lagging indicator, like most technical indicators, including the moving average, traders associate it with tapering volatility whenever its band narrows. \n \n \nAs history shows, this “squeeze” often precedes key breakout levels (in either direction) that can shape how prices evolve in the coming sessions. …",

          "description": "A common chant from many in this space these days in response to any discussion of changes to the Bitcoin protocol is “Don’t mess with Layer 1! You can just build it on Layer 2!” This seems like a very logical thing to do, right? Why risk the security and stability of L1 when you can just build on top of it? The problem is this fundamentally fails to understand the relationship between Layer 1 and Layer 2. \nAn L2 protocol is an extension of the L1.

For instance, imagine trying to build the Lightning Network without the existence of…",
