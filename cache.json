Thanks to this, inflows into these funds have accounted for most of the inflows that their respective issuers have recorded since the year began. \n \nSpot Bitcoin ETFs A Major Source Of Inflows For Fund Issuers\n \nBloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has accounted for 26% of the flows that the asset manager has seen this year across all its listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For context, BlackRock currently has 433 listed funds on the market.  \n \n \nBalchunas also revealed that the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) has accounted for 56% of Fidelity’s flows this year…",
