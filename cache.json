          "description": "After a recent slip, bitcoin moved back above $30,000 on Monday, ahead of a key week of U.S. economic data, with the headline being the inflation report. Inflation is expected to drop to 3.1% in June, which would be a nearly two-year low. Ethereum also slipped on Monday, remaining below $1,900.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) started the week trading near the $30,000 level, after the price dropped below this point over the weekend.\n \nFollowing a low of $29,985.39 on Sunday, BTC/USD jumped to an intraday high of $30,427.59 in today’s session.\n \nThe rebound comes as bears rejected a breakout below a recent support point at the $29,900 level.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nBTC has mostly been consolidating for the past four days, which has led to the 10-day (red) moving average shifting direction.\n \nAfter trending upwards in recent weeks, the moving average now looks as though it has flatlined, giving way to a potential downturn in the coming days.\n \nIn addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 57.75, marginally below a ceiling at 58.00.\n \nShould it fail to break out, there is a good chance that BTC could decline further in the coming days.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) continued to trade below $1,900 on Monday, as price is nearly 5% lower than at the same point last week.\n \nETH/USD slid to an intraday bottom at $1,848.78 to start the week, a day after trading nearly $30.00 higher.\n \nOverall, this has resulted in ethereum’s 10-day (red) moving average closing in on a downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nShould this occur, the first possible target will be a price floor at $1,815, which was last hit on June 30.\n \nPrice strength is currently at a reading of 50.35, however should it move under an upcoming floor at 48.00, a sell-off will likely occur.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nIs this recent downturn a result of profit taking?
