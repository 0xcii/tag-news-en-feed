He also reiterated his support for domestic Bitcoin mining at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville, pledging to ensure that American miners receive the electricity needed to mine more Bitcoin here in the USA.\n\nEarlier today, Marathon Digital announced a $250 million private offering of convertible notes, with the proceeds aimed at purchasing more Bitcoin, following the strategy of corporate Bitcoin accumulation pioneered by MicroStrategy.",
