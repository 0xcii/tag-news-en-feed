The latest macroeconomic data and a gold price that continues to thrive may provide the impetus needed to break out of the current consolidation phase.\n \nAt $2,042 per ounce, gold is just a few dollars away from its 2020 record high of $2,069.40. The traditional safe haven asset is up 13% over the past month, while Bitcoin gained 27% over the past 30 days.
