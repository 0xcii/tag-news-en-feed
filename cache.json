According to court documents released June 9, this was a “valid basis” for the decision to end the merger, and it effectively voided the termination fee.\n“We’re pleased with the court’s decision to dismiss BitGo’s claims,” A statement made by Galaxy Digital on Twitter read. “Now is the time for all of us to work together and focus on the task at hand: Upgrading the global financial system in a manner that promotes innovation and protects investors and consumers alike.”\nJust last week, it was announced that BitGo reached a preliminary agreement to acquire its primary U.S. competitor, Prime Trust. Although the details of that merger have not yet been made public, the industry had widely speculated in recent days that Prime Trust faced financial troubles. As such, the agreement has been seen as a relatively good thing, avoiding what many thought may be a coming failure of another large firm.",
