Places such as moose lodges, rotary clubs, union halls, car clubs, Boy Scouts, and Girl Scouts were the primary ways people in the same community could get together and organize around a shared sense of principles and purpose.\nThose days seem quaint and from our very distant past. Meeting people this way was the norm until the early 1990s, which is not long ago when you think about it.

          "description": "In a strategic move that solidifies its presence in the cryptocurrency sector, Thailand's Kasikorn Bank has announced the acquisition of a 97% stake in Satang Corporation Company Limited, the parent company of the Satang cryptocurrency exchange.\nThe deal, valued at 3.705 billion Thai baht ($102.8 million), was conducted through a newly formed Kasikorn Bank subsidiary called Unita Capital, specifically created for investments in digital asset companies, according to local news sources.\nKasikorn is the country's second-largest bank by assets under management, according to 2023 data from Statista.\nFollowing the finalization of the acquisition, Satang Corporation will be rebranded as Orbix Trade Company Limited. \nIn addition to the exchange services, the newly formed company will establish three additional subsidiaries: Orbix Custodian, Orbix Invest (a digital asset fund manager), and Orbix Technology, a blockchain technology developer.\nKasikorn's support for Bitcoin specifically, as opposed to other cryptocurrencies and digital tokens, is at this time unclear.\nThis announcement follows K-Bank's recent launch of a $100 million fund designed to target investments in web3, fintech, and artificial intelligence. Its counterpart, Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), is also reportedly making notable strides into web3 and the cryptocurrency space. Both banks are vying to offer a full spectrum of crypto services permissible within the regulatory framework in Thailand.\nSCB had earlier this year attempted a similar acquisition of a regional rival, though it was notably stalled over regulatory issues.\nKasikorn Bank has set an ambitious goal to capture 20% of the cryptocurrency market share in Thailand by the year 2024, marking its commitment notable at a time when many global banks remain on the sector's sidelines.",

          "description": "A South African crypto investment platform has expressed hopes that an asset recovery proposal will result in users regaining access to funds blocked after its custody partner froze withdrawals. The crypto platform said it has also engaged regulators whom it hopes will help expedite resolution of the matter. \n \nNo Timeline Given\n \nThe South African cryptocurrency investment platform Revix has said it is hopeful an asset recovery proposal put forward by its custody partner Haru Invest will ultimately result in users regaining access to blocked funds. However, Sean Sanders, the CEO of Revix, noted that while this may be positive news for users, his company is still unsure of when this process is set to be completed.\n \nAs previously reported by Bitcoin.com News in June, Revix began restricting users’ access to a portion (24%) of their funds. At the time, the crypto investment platform argued that the abrupt suspension of withdrawals by its South Korea-based custody partner had necessitated this decision.\n \n \nAlthough some have drawn parallels between what happened to Celsius and Haru Invest, in his remarks published by Moneyweb, Sanders said it is still premature for anyone to make such conclusions.\n \n“It’s not correct to compare Haru to Celsius just yet, as information hasn’t emerged on what exactly happened at Haru. However, Haru has publicly communicated that it plans to distribute assets it holds, which infers that there is value to be returned,” Sanders reportedly said.\n \nThe CEO added that his firm will continue to monitor the recovery efforts as well as ensure users get the highest possible value. According to the Moneyweb report, Revix has engaged regulators with the hopes that this will also help expedite the resolution of the matter.\n \nRegister your email here to get a weekly update on African news sent to your inbox:\n \n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
