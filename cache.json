The company has signed a rental agreement and anticipates operations to begin by the end of the third quarter.\n \nSMI Vantage Charts New Territory With Sarawak Bitcoin Mining Venture\n \nAccording to a report from The Edge Singapore, SMI Vantage, an investment and SaaS firm, has disclosed its intention to commence bitcoin mining operations in Sarawak. The firm is in the process of setting up two containers equipped with application-specific integrated circuit mining machines. Operations are projected to start by October 1, 2023, or the conclusion of the third quarter.\n \nSMI’s recent agreement was advised by Sovereign Systemtechnik, a Singapore-based engineering and technology firm. The deal was inked in September 2022 and marks SMI’s third bitcoin mining venture. While SMI already has operations in Melaka, Malaysia, it also boasts a bitcoin mining facility in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei’s capital. Beyond SaaS and cryptocurrency mining, SMI has a keen interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics solutions.\n \n \nWhile bitcoin mining is legal in Malaysia, using stolen electricity for crypto mining is highly discouraged. Reports indicate that from 2018, illegal crypto mining activities resulted in a loss of RM2.3 billion ($491,610) for Malaysia, with over 7,200 cases documented. SMI states that in Melaka, the company pays $0.07 to $0.08 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and $0.05 to $0.06 per kWh in Bandar Seri Begawan.\n \nWhat do you think about SMI expanding crypto mining operations to Sarawak?

          "description": "According to a report by Reuters, German banking giant Deutsche Bank has partnered with Swiss cryptocurrency firm Taurus to offer Bitcoin and crypto custody and other related services to its institutional clients.\n\"As the digital asset space is expected to encompass trillions of dollars of assets, it's bound to be seen as one of the priorities for investors and corporations alike,\" said Deutsche Bank's global head of securities services, Paul Maley. \"Our focus is not just on cryptocurrencies, but supporting our clients in the overall digital assets ecosystem.\"\nThe announcement also comes at a time when regulatory clarity around the industry is improving. Governments and financial regulators worldwide have been working to establish clear guidelines for the use and trading of digital assets.\nAccording to the report, Deutsche Bank is proceeding \"cautiously and in line with the spirit and the letter of the regulations governing this asset class.\" Maley went on to further explain that \"Our product design, and the nature of custody for clients, will make sure that there isn’t the risk of contaminating the bank’s other activities.\"\nBitcoin continues to gain momentum and recognition as a legitimate asset class, with the asset becoming a very attractive investment option for hedge funds, family offices, and other institutional investors. Deutsche Bank's decision to enter this market is seen as a strategic move to capture a share of this burgeoning market.",

Since the last transaction price of a coin is essentially its “buying price,” the realized cap serves as a measure of the aggregate value stored ins…",
