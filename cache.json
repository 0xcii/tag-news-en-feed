This new status quo could lead to even more hawkish measures impacting the traditional and cryptocurrency markets. \n \n \nA report released on January 29 by Michael J. Kramer – founder of Mott Capital, suggests that the FED needs to “push back against the market before it’s too late.” Since the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, financial conditions have eased dramatically. \n \nThis easing of financial conditions has led to a rise in commodity prices, a drop in mortgage rates, a weakening dollar, and a rally in stocks and significant crypto assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. \n \nAccording to Kramer, the February Federal Open Market Commit…",

The Binance Card is currently already available in many European countries. \nThe Brazilian version will \"allow all new and existing Binance users in Brazil with a valid national ID to make purchases and pay bills with cryptocurrencies.\" It will charge a 0.9% fee per transaction involving bitcoin, according to the blog, and there will be an offered 8% in cashback on select purchases, while allowing ATM withdrawals without fees.\nBrazil is one of the company’s top 10 markets, according to Binance, and the card will allow new and existing users in the country to pay bills and shop with cryptocurrencies at Mastercard merchants. The launch of the prepaid card is part of Binance's effort to \"broaden the connection between traditional finance and crypto.\" The card has already been launched in Argentina and is being rolled out in Brazil next. \nBrazil is one of the largest potential markets in the world, simply by the numbers alone. According to estimates, over 10 million of the country's population of approximately 214 million utilize cryptocurrency. Brazil has also experienced high inflation rates since the start of the pandemic similar to the United States, leaving citizens with an appetite for sound money.",

Market sentiment in cryptocurrencies shifted today, with the global market cap trading 2.11% lower as of writing.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) was one of Monday’s most notable movers, with prices retreating from recent gains.\n \nMATIC/USD slipped to an intraday bottom of $1.11 to start the week, less than 24 hours after rising to a high at $1.19 on Sunday.\n \nSunday’s move pushed polygon to its strongest point since November 8, as prices neared a ceiling of $1.20.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the decline in MATIC commenced following a failed breakout of a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 62.98, after failing to move beyond a resistance level of 73.00\n \nPrice strength now seems to be looking for a floor, with a target of 60.00 a possible destination for sellers.\n \n\n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nChainlink (LINK) was also lower to start the week, as the token was unable to move beyond a key price ceiling over the weekend.\n \nFollowing a high of $7.45 on Sunday, LINK/USD declined to a low of $6.98 earlier in the day.\n \nLike with polygon, today’s decline in chainlink came after a failed breakout of the resistance level at $7.50.\n \n \nAs of writing, LINK is back above $7.00, as earlier declines have somewhat eased. This comes as the RSI moves closer to a point of support.\n \nThe index is currently tracking at 56.06, with a floor of 55.00 the next visible target for bears.\n \nBulls are likely still present, however, and could look to make a move above $7.50 in the coming days.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould we see polygon move above $7.50 in the next few days?
