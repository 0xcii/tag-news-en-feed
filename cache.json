The relevant indicator here is the “difficulty regression model,” which is an estimation of the cost of Bitcoin production that the average miner incurs.\n \nAs the name already implies, this model is based on the concept of “mining difficulty,” which is a built-in feature on the BTC blockchain that decides how hard miners will need to work in order to successfully mine a block on the network.\n \nFor this model, Glassnode has made the…",

          "description": "Bitcoin continued to trade higher on Jan. 13, with prices racing above the $19,000 level, hitting a two-month peak in the process. The latest surge comes as traders continued to react to Wednesday’s U.S. inflation report, which dropped to 6.5%. Ethereum also rose today, hitting a fresh multi-month high.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) rallied to a two-month high earlier in today’s session, as prices climbed above the $19,000 mark.\n \nFollowing a low of $17,995.20 on Thursday, BTC/USD moved to a peak of $19,031.80 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of the move, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed to its strongest point since November 8, when price was above $20,000.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the rally came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose to a peak of 82.00, which was its highest mark in over a year.\n \nIn addition to this, the upwards trend on the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages continued to mature, thus extending bullish momentum.\n \nDespite this, prices are now well beyond overbought, which could mean that bears are lurking and preparing for reentry.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nLike BTC, ethereum (ETH) also significantly rose on Friday, with price moving above the $1,400 mark.\n \nETH/USD hit an intraday high of $1,432.28 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after trading at a bottom of $1,378.42.\n \nAs with bitcoin, this spike in price has pushed ethereum to its highest point since November 8, when it hit a high of $1,580.\n \n \nFrom the chart, prices of ETH are now deep in overbought territory, with the RSI index tracking at a level of 75.54.\n \nEarlier gains have already begun to slip, as previous bulls have begun taking profits in anticipation of a reversal in momentum.\n \nAs of writing, ETH/USD is trading at $1,410.60.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould we see ETH hit $1,500 this weekend?

The exchange has also provided information on what LUNC users should expect during and after the period of the upgrade.\n \nBinance Will Implement New Terra Classic (LUNC) Upgrade\n \nIn the announcement that was made on Friday, Binance revealed that it would be supporting the Terra Classic (LUNC) network upgrade. The upgrade which will be taking place on epoch 15,029 is a result of the LUNC community voting to pass Proposal 11242 which eliminates the re-minting of a portion of the burn tokens. \n \n \nThe upgrade is expected to take approximately three hours and during this time, deposits and withdrawals will be disabled on the Binance exchange. This will affect USTC, LUNC, and ANC for the duration of the upgrade. However, users will still be able to trade the cryptocurrencies as normal on the exchange.\n \nWhen the upgrade is done, deposits and withdrawals for LUNC, USTC, and ANC will automatically be re-opened, but Binance will not make an announcement on this. So users should just check to see if their deposits and withdrawals are working again.\n \n\n \n \nFurthermore, the upgrade could have an impact on transaction fees for LUNC, USTC, and ANC. “Binance will review and adjust the withdrawal fees for LUNC, USTC, and ANC via the Terra Classic (LUNC) network in accordance with market conditions, where applicable,” the exchange said.\n \n \nLUNC price is already responding positively to the Binance announcement. The digital asset is currently trading in the green at a price of $0.000176. Its price is up 6.87% in the last 24 hours and seeing gains of 17.03% in the last week, according to data from Coinmarketcap.",
