These wallets have been receiving BTC from exchanges and cold wallets as recently as March 2023, the report revealed.\nThe aggregation of these wallets provides insights into the liquidators' collection of BTC from Alameda's holdings. A recent transaction in April involved a 1 BTC test from Alameda's Merchant wallet. This BTC was later sent to a holding address now under the control of Alameda's Liquidators, known as 'Alameda Merchant 1.' Since the beginning of 2023, this address has accumulated 3,581 BTC, worth approximately $97.19 million at current prices.\nThe report states that “In total, Alameda’s liquidators have managed to secure 4,083 BTC (currently $110.81M) sourced from:\n\nOther Alameda Wallets: 34.94 BTC (currently worth $948.27K)\nDeribit: 467.366 BTC (currently worth $12.68M)\nWBTC Custodian: 2997 BTC (currently worth $81.34M)\nBitfinex: 298.027 BTC (currently worth $8.09M)\nUnlabelled Wallets (possibly an Exchange): 286.7 BTC (currently worth $7.78M)”\n \n         \n         \n         \n        A screenshot from the provided report. \n    \n“However, this is only a fraction of the BTC that Alameda controlled in the past,” the report noted. “Wallets connected to this network of Alameda’s BTC activity were worth at peak over $800M, with Alameda likely holding more BTC in Centralized Exchanges or unlinked Cold Wallets.”\nArkham Intelligence stated that it will continue to monitor the on-chain activity of Alameda’s liquidators.",

          "description": "In the wake of Binance’s departure from Canada, cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has announced its exit from the nation as well, citing “recent regulatory development” as the reason. Effective May 31, Bybit stated that it would cease accepting applications from Canadian residents.\n \nBybit to Pause Operations in Canada\n \nAccording to a Tuesday announcement, Bybit is withdrawing from Canada and has suspended new registrations from Canadian residents as of Wednesday. Starting July 31, Canadians will be unable to deposit funds; however, they can still withdraw and reduce their trading positions for the time being.\n \n“Canadian Customers who are implicated by these measures should take steps by September 30, 2023, 8AM UTC to wind down and manage their positions,” Bybit said. “Failing which, open positions in any margin products and derivative contracts—will be liquidated and the liquidated funds will be available for withdrawal.”\n \nWhile Bybit explained it has always prioritized compliance, it acknowledged that current regulations in Canada have created challenges. “In light of recent regulatory development, Bybit has made the difficult but necessary decision to pause the availability of our products and services,” the exchange explained, without specifying which particular regulations led to this decision.\n \n \nFollowing Binance’s exit from Canada due to similar concerns, Bybit has chosen not to mention the possibility of returning to the Canadian market if regulations change. Although a “pause” suggests the possibility. Meanwhile, the exchange is expanding its reach by recently receiving in-principle approval to operate in Kazakhstan.\n \nAre stricter regulations driving cryptocurrency exchanges away from Canada?
