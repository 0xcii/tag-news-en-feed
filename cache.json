          "description": "To facilitate cryptocurrency purchases for United  \nKingdom-based users, the crypto exchange Coinbase has announced the integration  \nof Apple Pay functionality. This development allows users to buy Bitcoin and  \nother digital assets directly through their iPhones using the Apple Pay  \nfeature.\nImplementing Apple Pay Feature for Safer Transactions\nAccording to Coinbase, enabling Apple Pay provides users  \nwith a \"more secure and private\" method of purchasing  \ncryptocurrencies. The exchange emphasized that when transactions are made using  \nApple Pay, card numbers are not stored on the device or Apple servers. Instead,  \na unique device account number is assigned, encrypted, and stored in a chip  \ndesigned for securing payment information.\nThis integration arrives at a time when the cryptocurrency  \nmarket is experiencing a slowdown in trading volume and retail interest.  \nCoinbase recently reported decreasing crypto volumes as the market seeks new  \nnarratives to drive prices higher. While the upcoming Bitcoin halving event  \ncould potentially spark price increases, the exchange acknowledged the  \nchallenge of navigating a historically weak period for risky assets like  \ncrypto.\nCrypto Social Media Engagement Wanes Despite Market Buzz\nBeyond trading volume, social media engagement data also  \nindicates subdued retail interest in cryptocurrencies. LunarCrush, a social  \nanalytics platform, observed fewer posts related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and  \nother cryptocurrencies on social media platforms. CEO Joe Vezzani noted that  \nsocial interactions within the crypto space are currently lower compared to  \nprevious bull markets, even after accounting for spam and bot activity.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Tareq Sikder at www.financemagnates.com.",

The move comes ahead of industry expectations for launches later this year.\nMultiple Chinese financial institutions, including the Hong Kong subsidiaries of Harvest Fund and China Southern Fund, have applied for bitcoin ETFs recently. Spot bitcoin ETFs provide exposure to actual bitcoin rather than derivatives.\nAccording to sources, the SFC will announce its first approved batch of spot bitcoin ETFs on April 15. After approvals, the funds can then be applied to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which is expected to take 10 days.\nThis accelerated timeline demonstrates Hong Kong's proactive approach in enhancing its appeal as a global financial hub. It also builds on the city's Bitcoin-friendly stance, including granting crypto exchange Hashkey a retail trading license last year.\nThe news comes after the tremendous success of spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States after approval this January, which attracted over $12 billion in inflows. As the first Asian jurisdiction to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, Hong Kong is paving the way for potential launches in other markets.\nAccessible Bitcoin investment products have seen rapid growth in demand among both institutional and retail investors. By leveraging its regulatory framework to meet this appetite, Hong Kong cements its position as a rising Bitcoin hub in Asia.",
