Trump has emerged as a vocal Bitcoin advocate while campaigning for the 2024 election.\nTrump became the first US president to accept Bitcoin lightning payments and oppose central bank digital currencies. On the campaign trail, he has promised to keep regulators away from Bitcoin if elected.\nYesterday in Wisconsin, Trump further declared he will \"end Joe Biden's war on crypto\" to secure America's future. He added new comments that \"We will ensure that the future of crypto and the future of Bitcoin will be made in America, otherwise other countries are going to have it.\"\n\nJUST IN: 🇺🇸 Donald Trump says \"to further secure America's future and create opportunity for young people, I will end Joe Biden's war on crypto.\"\n\"We will ensure that the future of crypto and the future of #Bitcoin will be made in America, otherwise other countries are going to… pic.twitter.com/NmmM2J3kIq\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 18, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nThis marks a shift. Trump explicitly states that he wants the USA to lead in Bitcoin; otherwise, rivals will surpass it.\nTrump's embrace of Bitcoin reflects Bitcoin's game theory. As Bitcoin grows too popular to ban, politicians realize they must support it to court Bitcoin-friendly voters.\nThe USA risks falling behind in the technological and financial race if it shuns Bitcoin and crypto innovation. Trump understands the USA must lead in this critical new domain.\nWhether sincerely supportive or opportunistic, Trump grasps Bitcoin's political capital. He knows backing Bitcoin can win votes, while attacking it risks alienating a passionate base.\nOther nations are pursuing pro-Bitcoin policies to attract economic growth and talent. To stay competitive, America must become a welcoming hub for Bitcoin and crypto developments.",
