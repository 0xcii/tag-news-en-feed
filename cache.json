By leveraging the Lightning network, Coinfinity aims to enhance Bitcoin's usability as a competitive payment system, surpassing the transaction volumes of major card networks such as VISA or Mastercard.\nCustomers of Coinfinity can gradually access Lightning features through the company's web portal and mobile app for iOS and Android — currently, users can utilize Lightning to buy bitcoin, after which it will be integrated into the savings plan feature and then the selling function. \nThis integration not only offers convenience to users but also contributes to the wider adoption of Bitcoin as a viable means of payment. The move comes as Coinfinity seeks to optimize transaction efficiency and reduce costs associated with traditional bitcoin transactions. \nFor further details on Coinfinity's Lightning network integration, interested individuals can read a blog post on the company’s website.",

The move pushed the price near a one-week high, and came as the global crypto market cap fell 0.07% lower as of writing. Solana also dropped, following a recent bull run.\n \nBinance Coin (BNB)\n \nBinance coin (BNB) was a notable gainer on Monday, as the token rose by nearly 5% to start the trading week.\n \nAfter falling to an intraday low of $232.01 earlier in today’s session, BNB/USD rose to a peak of $244.80.\n \nThis resulted in BNB hitting its strongest point since last Tuesday, when the token climbed to a high of $246.90.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that this latest rally occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 48.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 49.33, with the next visible point of resistance at 52.00.\n \nShould the index reach this point, there is a good chance that BNB will be near $250.00.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nAfter climbing to a two-month high last week, solana (SOL) was in the red on Monday, falling for a second straight day.\n \nSOL/USD hit an intraday low of $20.57, which comes less than 24 hours after price peaked at $21.53.\n \nThe move appears to be a result of profit taking, since solana reached its highest point since May 6, this past Saturday.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it seems that sentiment is still somewhat bullish, as traders opted to reject a breakout below $20.00.\n \nAs of writing, the token is trading at $21.09, with the 10-day (red) moving average still upward facing.\n \nOverall, the recent decline comes following a collision with a ceiling at $22.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould solana move back above $22.00 in the coming days?
