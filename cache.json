Additionally, traders’ nerves increased ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s latest speech.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) fell by nearly 5% in today’s session, as traders reacted to several points of macro-economic news.\n \nAfter surging to a peak of $0.000007668 on Tuesday, SHIB/USD dropped to an intraday bottom at $0.000007261 earlier in the day.\n \nThis drop saw bearish sentiment marginally increase, with short sellers now seemingly targeting a floor at $0.00000640.\n \n \nOverall, SHIB has fallen for three of the last six days, pushing its relative strength index (RSI) to a current low at 41.89.\n \nAs a result of this, the index fell below a support point at 46.00, and now seems to be heading for a lower floor at 40.00.\n \nShould it reach this point, there is a good chance that the meme coin will be trading under the $0.00000700 mark.\n \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nIn addition to SHIB, polygon (MATIC) also edged lower on Wednesday, falling to a one-week low in the process.\n \nMATIC/USD bottomed out at $0.6293 earlier in the day, which comes following Tuesday’s peak at $0.6713.\n \nThe drop in prices resulted in polygon falling to its lowest point since June 20, when it reached a low of $0.5913.\n \n \nFrom the chart, this decline comes despite momentum appearing to be bullish, with the 10-day (red) moving average nearing an upwards cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nAdditionally, price strength has fallen below a floor at 39.00, and is tracking at 38.63 as of writing.\n \nIn the event MATIC continues to decline, a likely target for bears will be an upcoming support zone at $0.580.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill polygon end the month below $0.600?
