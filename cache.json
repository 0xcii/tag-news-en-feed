          "description": "Bitcoin rose closer to the $17,000 level on Saturday, despite crypto markets mostly consolidating to start the week. The global cryptocurrency market cap is down 0.32% as of writing. Ethereum was also higher earlier in the day, with prices nearing the $1,230 level.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) remained under the $17,000 level to start the weekend, as prices continued to consolidate despite earlier gains.\n \nBTC/USD hit a high of $16,905.22 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after price was at a bottom, at the $16,793.53 mark.\n \nThe move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency continue to trade above a key point of support at $16,800.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failed to break above a ceiling at 48.00.\n \nThe index is currently trading at 46.72, with bulls still attempting to push past the aforementioned point of resistance.\n \nOn the other hand, should price strength decline below a floor at 45.00, bitcoin will likely move towards the $16,000 level.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also consolidated to start the weekend, with prices edging closer to a key resistance level.\n \nFollowing a low of $1,216.34 on Friday, ETH/USD raced to a peak of $1,227.00 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of today’s move, ethereum once again attempted to break out of a key ceiling at the $1,230 level.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the breakout did not occur, mainly due to the RSI also remaining below a ceiling of its own at 47.50.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 47.12, with momentum appearing to be bearish as a result of the direction of moving averages (MA).\n \nThe 10-day (red) MA extended its downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which typically is a sign of price declines.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould market sentiment change ahead of Christmas Day?

The “exchange reserve” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Ethereum currently being stored in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.\n \nWhen the value of this metric goes up, it means holders are depositing their coins to exchanges right now. One of the main reasons investors use exchanges is for swapping their ETH to another crypto or for cashing out in fiat.
