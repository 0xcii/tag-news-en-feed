          "description": "Blockchain.com has become the latest crypto company to see a valuation cut in its latest $110 million Series-E funding round. According to Bloomberg, the company was valued at less than half its last $14 billion valuation. However, the official announcement did not reveal the current valuation.\nAnother Funding Round of Blockchain.com\n United Kingdom-based venture capital firm Kingsway Capital, an existing investor in Blochchian.com, led the latest funding round. Other companies participating in the round include Baillie Gifford, Lakestar, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Coinbase Ventures.\nAfter the latest round, Blockchain.com is adding the Founder and CEO of Kingsway, Manny Stotz, and Lakestar’s Partner, Nicolas Brand, to its board.\nBlockchain.com was established in 2011 as a crypto wallet platform. It later added crypto exchange services and has grown into a major platform. According to the company, nearly 33 percent of all Bitcoin transactions are made through Blockchain.com-managed wallets. Its website shows over 90 million Blockchain.com wallets were created with 40 million verified users. Over $1 trillion worth of crypto assets were transacted through Blockchain.com.\nValuation Takes a Massive Dent\nIn its previous funding round closed last year in March, Blockchain.com was valued at $14 billion. The company was valued at $5.2 billion a year before when it raised $300 million. The crypto company has raised $600 million to date, as seen on Crunchbase.\nMeanwhile, Blockchain.com is expanding its global reach. In recent years, it has received regulatory approvals in several jurisdictions, including Singapore and Dubai. It is also operating in many other countries with local licenses.\nDespite the developments, the company also witnessed some setbacks. It had a massive exposure to 3AC, as it loaned the collapsed company about $270 million. The company further laid off 25 percent of its staff, about 150 employees, last year.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.",
