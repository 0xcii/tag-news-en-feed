Ethereum was largely unchanged today.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin started the week hovering around the $26,000 region, as markets prepared for a big week of economic data.\n \nFollowing a high of $26,406.15 on Sunday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,914.93 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency has mostly consolidated around this level for the past ten days, since surging above $30,000 earlier in the month.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nSince then a huge red wave has swept through the market, with BTC falling to a two-month low just over a week ago.\n \nPrices have continued to trend sideways as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has failed to break out of a resistance level of 30.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 27.34.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) also consolidated on Monday, with prices largely unchanged from Sunday’s low.\n \nETH/USD climbed to a high of $1,665.14 earlier in the day, which followed on from Sunday’s bottom of $1,641.63.\n \nThe move saw ethereum once again climb above a support point of $1,650, following a recent drop below this zone.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \nSimilar to bitcoin, the RSI has been unable to move past a ceiling of 33.00, which seems to be the main barrier to a bullish resurgence.\n \nIn the event this level is breached in the coming days, ethereum will most likely move above $1,700.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill ethereum rally this week?
