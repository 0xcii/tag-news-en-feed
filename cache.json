He said in an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt Sunday without giving a specific timeframe:\n \n\nA payment option with bitcoin is coming.\n \nRisch explained that Liechtenstein plans to accept bitcoin and immediately exchange BTC for Swiss francs, the national currency, in order to avoid exchange-rate risks. He also clarified that the cryptocurrency would not be granted equal status as the Swiss franc.\n \nThe prime minister additionally told the news outlet that he was open to investing state reserves in bitcoin in the future.\n \n \nLiechtenstein’s reserves, currently amounting to approximately 2.23 billion Swiss francs ($2.51 billion), are invested mostly in securities, Handelsblatt reported, citing the finance ministry.\n \nRisch was further quoted by Reuters as saying:\n \n\nCryptocurrencies like bitcoin are still too risky. But this assessment can of course change.\n \nIn October 2019, Liechtenstein’s legislature approved the “Token and Trustworthy Technology Service Providers Act” (abbreviated TVTG in German). The government noted in its announcement at the time that with the new law, Liechtenstein becomes the first country to comprehensively regulate the token economy.\n \nWhat is your opinion regarding the plan of Liechtenstein’s government to accept bitcoin payments and the possibility of investing reserves in bitcoin?

          "description": "Bittrex, a bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange platform founded in 2014, has filed for bankruptcy in the state of Delaware. The decision comes after the company previously announced that it would be ceasing all operations in the U.S. effective April 30th as a result of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges against the firm and its former CEO for operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. However, this announcement does not impact Bittrex Global, according to a statement released by the company, which will continue its operations as usual for customers outside of the U.S.\nFor customers who did not withdraw their funds from the platform prior to the end of April, the company has stated that their funds remain “safe and secure.” While the Bankruptcy Court will ultimately decide the method by which those funds can be claimed by and distributed to customers, the company stated its intentions to activate those accounts as soon as possible so that customers who meet the necessary regulatory requirements can withdraw their funds.\nBittrex has also retained Omni Agent Solutions to provide email and website updates to customers. The company has encouraged affected customers to visit their website during this process, as they will provide additional information as it becomes available, and customers will also receive information directly from the bankruptcy court.\nIn the released statement, the company said, \"Our main priority is to ensure that our customers are made whole. We are committed to working through the bankruptcy process in a way that is transparent and compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience during this time.\"",
