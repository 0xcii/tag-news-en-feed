The rally came despite crypto price consolidation, with the global market cap largely unchanged as of writing. Stellar also surged, remaining near a recent two-week high. \n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin (TON) was one of Thursday’s notable gainers, as price rallied by as much as 4% in today’s session.\n \nFollowing a low of $1.75 on Wednesday, TON/USD rose to a peak of $1.88, earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move comes days after the token reached a high of $2.05, which was the highest point it has hit since May.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the rise in price comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped at a floor of 60.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 63.35, with the next point of resistance around 66.00.\n \nIn the event it moves beyond this level, there is a good chance that price will move back towards $2.00.\n \n \nStellar (XLM)\n \nStellar (XLM) also hovered in the green, as the price remained near a resistance level of $0.1300.\n \nXLM/USD rose to a peak of $0.1243 earlier in the day, which comes following a low of $0.1178 the day prior.\n \nThe move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average approaches an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \n \nIn addition to this, the RSI is on the cusp of breaking out of a key resistance level of 50.00, which has been held for close to a month.\n \nBulls will potentially aim to penetrate this point in the coming days, taking price near a ceiling of $0.1400.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect stellar to rally further this week?

          "description": "In a move that underscores the momentum of Bitcoin Ordinals protocol ecosystem, the OnChainMonkey (OCM) project has committed to migrating its entire digital art collection from Ethereum to Bitcoin. \nIn total, moving the collection, which includes burning the old NFTs on Ethereum so they can no longer be traded, cost the project over $1 million in Bitcoin fees.\nOnChainMonkey, created by Metagood, became the first profile picture collection created entirely on-chain in a single Ethereum transaction back in 2021. Further, it launched its first Ordinals collection in February shortly after the Ordinals launch.\nNotably, the decision was supported by a broad portion of OnChainMonkey NFT owners, with users voting to subsidize a portion of the substantial migration cost.\nThe DAO proposal gained overwhelming support, with a quorum of 2,000 votes reached within 24 hours. Overall, 99% of voters backed the migration to Bitcoin, a sign that signals NFT users believe Ordinals on Bitcoin may have a greater value than Ethereum-backed NFTs.\n\"Our OCM community has conviction in our move to Bitcoin. We have been involved with Ordinals since the beginning of the year, and the OCM community, in particular, has a great understanding of the potential and benefits of the migration to Bitcoin,\" Metagood CEO Danny Yang said.\nThe transaction comes at a time when the Ordinals market has cooled considerably, with total transaction volumes and sales across exchanges seeing a notable decline.\nThat said, the news suggests this sector of the market could be gearing up for a second push given that Bitcoin Ordinals represent such a significant technology improvement over crypto-based NFTs.",
