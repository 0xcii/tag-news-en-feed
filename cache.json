Last week, the popular Ethereum wallet introduced a “Sell” option allowing users in the U.S., the U.K., and some European markets to cash out ether (ETH) to major fiat currencies and have the amount sent to a bank account or a Paypal balance.\n \nDo you think Paypal will continue to expand crypto payment services for Web3 businesses?
