This development is significant given the impact it has already had and could have on meme coins in the long run. \n \nRoaring Kitty’s Return Sparks Price Gains For Meme Coins\n \nRoaring Kitty posted on his X (formerly Twitter) platform on June 2, his first post since May 17, when he returned to the social media platform after three years of absence. Similar to what happened when Roaring Kitty made his first post (since 2021) last month, his recent post once again triggered a significant run for several meme coins. \n \n \nGME, a Solana-based meme coin that pays tribute to the GameStop short squeeze in 2021, has skyrocketed by over 200% in the last 24 hours, thanks to Roaring…",
