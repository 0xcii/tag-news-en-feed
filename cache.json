          "description": "Data from CoinGeko shows that Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Jupiter recently surpassed Ethereum’s foremost DEX Uniswap in an important metric. This has created a narrative that the SOL network might indeed be ready to take over Ethereum’s position as the King of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). \n \nJupiter Surpasses Uniswap In Trading Volume \n \nAccording to CoinGeko, Jupiter has recorded over $510 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours, surpassing Ethereum’s Uniswap V3 and V2, which recorded $455 and $76 million respectively. Jupiter’s recent dominance is believed to be partly due to the recent WEN airdrop that occurred on its launchpad.\n \n \nThis airdrop caused a splurge of new money into the Solana ecosystem and Jupiter in particular.
