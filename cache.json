          "description": "The Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI) team has unveiled SRI 1.0.0, a new milestone in their journey to decentralize and optimize bitcoin mining, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. This latest release is now available for immediate testing and seamless integration.\nSome key highlights of SRI 1.0.0 include:\n\nMiners can connect to SV2 pools without upgrading existing SV1 firmware through Translation Proxy or directly using an SV2 firmware device like BraiinsOS.\nMiners have the flexibility to run their bitcoin nodes, construct templates, and declare them to the SV2 Pool.\nThe implementation of pool fallback functionality ensures continuity in mining activities even if a pool decides to censor transactions, thereby incentivizing pools to prioritize miners' interests.\n\nTh…",

His analysis focused on ADA’s 2-week chart, which showed that key moving averages are realigning, the analyst claimed.
