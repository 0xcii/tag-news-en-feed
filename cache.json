Lightning allows near-instant Bitcoin payments with significantly lower fees by moving transactions off-chain.\nCoinbase has been working to implement Lightning support for years to further its mission of building a payments network costing pennies per transaction. This integration finally unlocks the power of instant and affordable Bitcoin payments for the exchange's massive US user base.\nBy partnering with Lightning infrastructure provider Lightspark, co-founded by former PayPal executive David Marcus, Coinbase now gives users the option to withdraw or send Bitcoin via Lightning. \nTransactions process in seconds and cost a fraction of on-chain BTC payments.\nMarcus celebrated the milestone, stating \"We're so thrilled to be part of this journey with you to bring Lightning to 100s of millions of people in over 100 countries. Big milestone for the entire network and for Bitcoin.\"\nThe Bitcoin community has long awaited Lightning integration from Coinbase, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges. \nWhile the Lightning Network has seen impressive growth over recent years, Coinbase's integration marks the protocol's biggest leap towards broader adoption yet, expanding the network to millions of new users.\nCoinbase's adoption signals faith in the network's maturity and highlights the promise of Layer 2 scaling for helping Bitcoin evolve into a global payment rail.",

After factoring in Alliance’s bitcoin mining expenses, the company saw a net profit of $7.3 million from Bitcoin mining in Q1.\nThe amount of Bitcoin Alliance holds ranks it 23rd on the list of companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheet. \nJoe Craft, President and CEO of Alliance, pointed out on the call that the company isn’t necessarily pivoting to a bitcoin-centric strategy but, instead, approaching its bitcoin mining operation with a high degree of practicality.\n“We are selling what we need to cover our expenses, so our exposure is limited,” said Craft.\n“We do have some extra capacity that we're renting out to other Bitcoin miners within the data center that we've effectively built for this Bitcoin mining to take advantage of the low energy costs we have,” he added.\nFor more information on Alliance Resource Partners, visit the company’s website.",
