Ultimately, ZeroSync seeks to enable full nodes to do the same.\nZK proofs allow a prover to generate a short mathematical statement that proves to a verifier that a given computation is correct without revealing any details about such computation. Constructing this proof can be computationally expensive, but the statement it provides is always very compact, regardless of how large the data served as an input to the proof calculation was –– enabling blazing fast verification of the correctness of that data with mathematical certainty.

Shortly after, around 325.19 bitcoins from January 2012 addresses were mobilized.\n \nThe initial two transfers (1 & 2) originated from wallets set up over 11 years ago on January 11, 2012. The first address shifted 145.53 BTC, while the subsequent one dispatched 21.97 BTC. Both of these transactions secured confirmation at block height 807,852 and were discovered by btcparser.com.\n \n \nIn quick succession, the address labeled “1HNnG” executed a transfer of 157.69 BTC, receiving confirmation at block height 807,853. Intriguingly, all three transactions, as per Blockchair’s privacy gauge, lacked advanced privacy measures, rendering them susceptible to transaction scrutiny.\n \nOverlapping addresses were pinpointed in these three shifts, indicating repeated address usage. Diving deeper into clustering heuristics and onchain insights, it’s evident that these three transactions likely stemmed from a singular owner. This revelation implies that in 2023 alone, 43 dormant bitcoin addresses from 2012 have been reactivated, moving their vintage coins.\n \n \nMoreover, factoring in the recent 325.19 bitcoin transaction from 2012, the year 2023 has witnessed a cumulative transfer of 3,700.97 BTC from this year, translating to a whopping $98.25 million at current BTC exchange rates.\n \nWhen the owner initially secured the coins, each bitcoin had a price tag of $6.36. Back then, the trove’s value was a modest $2,068, a stark contrast to its present worth of $8.6 million.\n \nWhat do you think about the recent sleeping bitcoin spends in 2023?
