          "description": "The BIS’ Basel Committee introduced a finalized proposal for limits to the amount of Tier 1 capital banks can hold in bitcoin.\nThe Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has finalized a proposed policy that would place a 2% limit on banks' Tier 1 capital held in bitcoin. This comes with an endorsement from the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the oversight body of the Basel Committee, which is the “primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks.”\nInvestopedia defines Tier 1 capital as “the core capital held in a bank's reserves [that] is used to fund business activities for the bank's clients. It includes common stock, as well as disclosed reserves and certain other assets.” \nThe policy includes bitcoin in its definition of Group 2 crypto assets, saying that “In addition to any tokenised traditional assets and stablecoins that fail the classification conditions, Group 2 includes all unbacked cryptoassets.” It later describes that “a bank’s total exposure to Group 2 cryptoassets should not generally be higher than 1% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital and must not exceed 2% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital.”\n\nThe BIS had previously considered a policy of 1% for global banks. In turn, the banks requested a 5% reserve limit. This 2% appears to be a compromise between the two. According to data from 2020, if applied to all banks in the world, who collectively custody approximately $180 trillion, this would amount to a limit of $3.6 trillion in bitcoin held by such entities. \nTiff Macklem, Chair of the GHOS, stated that “Today's endorsement by the GHOS marks an important milestone in developing a global regulatory baseline for mitigating risks to banks from cryptoassets. It is important to continue to monitor bank-related developments in cryptoasset markets. We remain ready to act further if necessary.”",

Polygon also extended recent declines, hitting a multi-week low as a result. \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) hit an all-time low in today’s session, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remains bearish, following recent economic data.\n \nADA/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.2845 earlier in today’s session, less than a day after trading at $0.3026.\n \nToday’s sell-off comes as cardano fell for a third straight session, breaking out of a key support point in the process.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the aforementioned floor is at the $0.3000 mark, which was broken once before, on November 21.\n \nThe 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also moved below a floor of 35.50, and as of writing is tracking at 30.91.\n \nThis is the lowest point the index has hit since October 22, with prices hitting a bottom of $0.3100 on that occasion.\n \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) was another notable token to fall today, with prices also moving lower for a third straight day.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.891 on Thursday, MATIC/USD dropped to a bottom of $0.8483 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of this drop, polygon moved to its lowest point since November 30, when prices hit a bottom of $0.837\n \n \nMATIC has since rebounded from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $0.8569, which is still nearly 4% lower than Thursday’s floor.\n \nThis slight rebound comes as the RSI rejected a breakout of a point of support at the 43.00 level, and the index is currently at the 44.26 mark.\n \nHistorically, bulls have used this floor as a point of reentry, and should this reoccur, then we could see MATIC move back towards the $0.90 level.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat other factors are behind today’s decline in crypto prices?
