This represents a notable 33%  \nincrease from the approximately $55 million secured in 2023.\nRecovering and Freezing Illegal Crypto Assets \nAccording to the crypto exchange giant, the platform's  \nsecurity team has been at the forefront of recovering misplaced and lost funds  \nand freezing ill-gotten gains that find their way onto the exchange. Binance  \nhas also reportedly collaborated with both industry peers and the public sector  \nto ensure that affected users receive the necessary support.\nThe majority of the recovered and frozen funds  \napproximately 80%—are tied to hacks, exploits, and thefts that occur outside  \nthe Binance platform. The remaining 20% involves scams that also originate  \nexternally. \nBinance's stance has been instrumental in these  \nrecoveries, with Chief Security Officer Jimmy Su emphasizing the company's  \nuser-centric culture as a driving force behind these achievements.\nContrary to what might be expected, the increase in  \nrecovered and frozen funds does not indicate a rise in criminal activity within  \nthe cryptocurrency space. With all transactions publicly recorded, it has  \nreportedly become easier to trace and recover stolen funds.\nCrypto Crime Report\nAccording to Chainalysis' 2024 Crypto Crime Report,  \nthe total value received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses dropped  \nsignificantly in 2023. The report noted a decline in the share of all crypto  \ntransaction volume associated with illicit activity, from 0.42% in 2022 to  \n0.34% in 2023.\nExpect ongoing updates as this story evolves. \n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.",

This comes just days after announcing plans to raise ¥10.08 billion through a stock rights offering, mostly for Bitcoin buys.\n\nJUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japanese public company Metaplanet secures ¥1 billion loan to buy more #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/VNVemLD9cy\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 8, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nMetaplanet first revealed its Bitcoin treasury strategy in May, aiming to hedge against yen depreciation. The firm currently holds around 246 Bitcoins worth $14 million acquired over many buys.\nThe 0.1% APR loan from shareholder MMXX Ventures has a 6-month term. Metaplanet plans to allocate the entire ¥1 billion to expand its Bitcoin reserves.\nAt current prices, ¥1 billion could purchase around 118 additional bitcoins. This mimics MicroStrategy's playbook of raising debt to fund Bitcoin purchases since 2020. MicroStrategy's bitcoin bet has increased its share price dramatically.\nCEO Simon Gerovich stated that the firm believes Bitcoin offers twin benefits as an asset that can appreciate and hedge against a weakening yen.\nBy securing loans and issuing stock to accumulate bitcoin, Metaplanet is essentially borrowing yen to stack sats. The company can pay back loans using future Bitcoin appreciation.\nThe loan and planned stock offering highlight Metaplanet's commitment to aggressively growing its Bitcoin war chest. As a public company, this strategy indirectly exposes Japanese investors to Bitcoin. \nDisclaimer: Bitcoin Magazine is wholly owned by BTC Inc., which also operates UTXO Management, a regulated capital allocator focused on the digital assets industry and invested in Metaplanet.
