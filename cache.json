          "description": "Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former CEO of FTX, now faces a 13-count indictment as U.S. officials have added new charges. One of the new charges alleges that SBF leveraged $40 million to influence “one or more Chinese government officials.”\n \nDetails of the Bribery Charges Against Sam Bankman-Fried\n \nSam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the co-founder and former CEO of FTX, now faces charges of bribing Chinese government officials. “Bankman-Fried and others agreed to pay cryptocurrency to one or more foreign officials in China to influence and induce them to unfreeze the accounts in order to assist Bankman-Fried, Alameda, and others in obtaining and retaining business for, and directing business to, Bankman-Fried, Alameda, and others,” the revised indictment states.\n \nThis is not the first time SBF’s indictment has been revised. In February 2023, Bitcoin.com News reported that SBF’s indictment was revised to include bank fraud charges. SBF faces other charges as well, including defrauding the Federal Election Commission (FEC), wire fraud, and securities fraud. The former FTX CEO has pleaded not guilty to the charges, but three of the firm’s top deputies have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with federal prosecutors.\n \n \nThe revised filing indicates that Chinese officials reportedly seized two accounts owned by Alameda Research, SBF’s quantitative trading arm, which were allegedly held on “two of China’s largest crypto exchanges” in 2021. Once again, the revised indictment does not include any other defendants, and Sam Bankman-Fried is the only individual named.\n \nWith the addition of bank fraud charges last month and newly added bribery charges, SBF now faces a total of 13 charges from the Department of Justice in New York. He also faces lawsuits filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n \nWhat do you think about the new charges SBF faces? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.",

          "description": "Xrp rose to a fresh five-month high on Tuesday, as prices climbed for a fourth straight session. The token moved to its highest point since November, which comes despite a red wave sweeping over cryptocurrency markets. The global market cap is down 2.35% as of writing.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, rose for a fourth consecutive session on Monday, as prices hit their highest point in five months.\n \nXRP/USD surged to an intraday high at $0.5029, less than 24 hours after falling to a low of $0.4573.\n \nAs a result of the move, XRP hit its strongest point since November 6, breaking out of a ceiling at $0.4950 in the process.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved to a one-week high, with a current reading of 68.87.\n \nThis is marginally below resistance at 69.00, and close to a recent seven-month high at 74.00.\n \nEarlier gains in XRP have already begun to ease, with bulls seemingly securing gains around this ceiling.\n \n \nMonero (XMR)\n \nDuring today’s red wave, monero (XMR) was a notable token to fall, as prices moved to a five-day low.\n \nFollowing a high of $163.98 to start the week, XMR/USD slipped to a bottom at $149.85 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe drop sees monero fall by as much as 7%, edging closer to a long-term support point at $146.00 in the process.\n \n \nWhilst price has yet to reach this floor, the RSI collided with a support point of its own at the 49.00 mark.\n \nBulls have since pushed the index higher, with price strength now tracking at 50.08, which comes as XMR moved away from earlier lows.\n \nCurrently, monero is tracking at $154.03, with a move towards a ceiling at $156.00 a strong possibility.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect monero to move higher in upcoming days?
