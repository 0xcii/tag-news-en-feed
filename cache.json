One of them happens to be a common negative narrative that has plagued the Cardano network for some time now. \n \nWhy ADA Holders Should Sell Their Tokens  \n \nAccording to the report written by K33’s Head of Research, Anders Helseth, ADA holders should offload their ADA tokens because there is no “proof of Cardano being used for anything.” This, the report claims, is something that will, in the long run, affect ADA’s utility. \n \n \nHelseth noted that Cardano supporters may want to counter his assertion with an argument about how the network sees an average of around 90,000 daily transactions.
