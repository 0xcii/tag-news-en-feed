While Do Kwon reportedly prefers being sent to South Korea, Montenegro’s justice minister is said to be leaning towards sending him to the United States.\n \nDo Kwon Facing Multiple Extradition Requests\n \nThe High Court in Montenegro has extended the detention of Do Kwon, the founder and former CEO of Terraform Labs, by two months, according to a Bloomberg report. The court’s ruling followed extradition requests forwarded by the U.S. and South Korea.\n \nMarija Rakovic, the Podgorica High Court’s spokeswoman, revealed on Dec. 12 that Do Kwon’s custody term is now set to end on Feb. 15, 2024. The decision to prolong the Terraform Labs founder’s term in custody comes just a few weeks after the High Court ruled in favor of his extradition.\n \n \nAs reported by Bitcoin.com News, Do Kwon had agreed to be extradited to his native country, South Korea. However, since there were multiple requests for his extradition, the Podgorica High Court ultimately deferred the decision to determine Do Kwon’s next destination to Montenegro’s Justice Minister.\n \nHowever, a Wall Street Journal report on Dec. 7 citing unnamed sources said that the Justice Minister is leaning toward extraditing the ex-Terraform Labs CEO to the United States. Do Kwon’s legal representatives have reportedly appealed against the High Court’s extradition ruling. According to Rakovic, the appellate court, also located in Podgorica, is currently considering Do Kwon’s appeal.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",
