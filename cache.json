Market sentiment in cryptocurrencies shifted today, with the global market cap trading 2.11% lower as of writing.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) was one of Monday’s most notable movers, with prices retreating from recent gains.\n \nMATIC/USD slipped to an intraday bottom of $1.11 to start the week, less than 24 hours after rising to a high at $1.19 on Sunday.\n \nSunday’s move pushed polygon to its strongest point since November 8, as prices neared a ceiling of $1.20.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the decline in MATIC commenced following a failed breakout of a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 62.98, after failing to move beyond a resistance level of 73.00\n \nPrice strength now seems to be looking for a floor, with a target of 60.00 a possible destination for sellers.\n \n\n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nChainlink (LINK) was also lower to start the week, as the token was unable to move beyond a key price ceiling over the weekend.\n \nFollowing a high of $7.45 on Sunday, LINK/USD declined to a low of $6.98 earlier in the day.\n \nLike with polygon, today’s decline in chainlink came after a failed breakout of the resistance level at $7.50.\n \n \nAs of writing, LINK is back above $7.00, as earlier declines have somewhat eased. This comes as the RSI moves closer to a point of support.\n \nThe index is currently tracking at 56.06, with a floor of 55.00 the next visible target for bears.\n \nBulls are likely still present, however, and could look to make a move above $7.50 in the coming days.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould we see polygon move above $7.50 in the next few days?
