In recent years, the intersection of technology and journalism has paved the way for groundbreaking initiatives. One such initiative is Project Spartacus, a revolutionary endeavor that aims to inscribe the Wikileaks Afghan War Logs on the Bitcoin blockchain. This interview delves into the intricacies of Project Spartacus, exploring its unknown genesis, objectives, and the implications it carries for data security and transparency.\nUnderstanding Project Spartacus\nProject Spartacus is an ambitious undertaking that seeks to marry the principles of transparency and data integrity with the power of…",

          "description": "The term \"crypto\" has become a buzzword, encompassing a wide range of digital assets. Amongst Bitcoiners, it has also become a derogatory term used to refer to altcoins, as seen in the oft-repeated phrase “Bitcoin, Not Crypto.” However, not everything in the crypto world is truly \"crypto,\" at least not in the literal sense of the name.\nThe true essence of a cryptocurrency lies in its reliance on cryptography, and nothing else, to secure its network. This brings us to an essential distinction: only proof-of-work coins can be genuinely considered “crypto.” This distinction is not just semantic but fundamentally important, as it underscores what exactly strengthens the ledger.\n\"Cryptocurrency\" combines two critical components: \"crypto,\" referring to cryptography, and \"currency,\" denoting a me…",
