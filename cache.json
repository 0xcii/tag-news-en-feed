However, he issued a cautionary note that the cryptocurrency’s deviation from the Nasdaq 100 starting late in Q1 might signal more widespread frailty in risk assets, especially if stocks pull back amidst usual second-half market swings, continuing Fed tightening, and receding fears of a recession.\n \n\n \n \n#Bitcoin 180-day volatility is…",

A new blog post has prompted a meticulous analysis from the SHIB army, keen to understand the broader implications of such an integration.\n \nSelf-Sovereign Identity is not a novel concept, but its application in the blockchain realm is still in nascent stages. SSI challenges the traditional models of digital identity management by decentralizing the control and verification of personal data.\n \nInstead of a centralized entity or intermediary being responsible for data verification and storage, SSI empowers users to manage and verify their own identity data.
