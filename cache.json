The finance judicial investigation service of France is currently scrutinizing the actions of Binance’s subsidiary in the country.\n \nFrench Regulators Probe Binance\n \nAmid mounting challenges faced by the crypto exchange Binance, recent developments reveal that French authorities have turned their attention to the exchange’s French subsidiary. Following the legal action taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance, reports indicate that law enforcement officials in France have initiated an investigation into the matter. The French publication Le Monde has verified this information with the Paris public prosecutor’s office.\n \nThe complaint against Binance contains accusations of “aggravated money laundering” and charges related to the “illegal provision of services for digital assets (PSAN).” It is alleged that Binance neglected to establish a proper know-your-customer (KYC) compliance process within the country. However, a spokesperson from Binance, in correspondence with Reuters, disclosed that the exchange engaged in a meeting with regulators just last week.\n \n \n“In France, on-site visits by regulators and inspectors are part of regulatory obligations to which all financial institutions must adhere. We had an on-site visit last week by the relevant authorities,” the Binance representative said. “We will not comment on the specifics of law enforcement or regulatory investigations except to say that information about our users is held securely and only provided to government officials upon receipt of documented appropriate justification.”\n \nWhat are your thoughts on the French investigation surrounding Binance?

          "description": "Bitcoin rose back above $25,000 on Friday, as markets continued to digest recent U.S. economic data. Yesterday saw retail sales climb higher than expected, rising by 0.3% in May, better than a projected decline of 0.1%. Ethereum moved closer to the $1,700 level.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin bulls made a brief appearance during Friday’s session, pushing the price back above $25,000 in the process.\n \nFollowing a low of $24,797.17 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $25,735.31 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of the move, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed above a recent ceiling at the $25,500 mark.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nDespite today’s $1,000 jump in price, the relative strength index (RSI) still remains below a resistance of its own at 42.00\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.00, which could act as a major hurdle to further upwards momentum.\n \nIt will be interesting to see how traders behave over the coming weekend, with the chance to buy this week’s dip still present.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) made relative gains in today’s session, as the cryptocurrency moved back towards the $1,700 level.\n \nETH/USD reached a high of $1,676.41 on Friday, less than 24 hours after nearing a breakout below $1,600.\n \nThe rebound in ethereum comes as the RSI moved away from a recent three-month low of 30.74, which was in oversold territory.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nSimilar to BTC above, price strength has since climbed, and is currently at a reading of 33.39, which is still bearish.\n \nTraders will likely look to March, which is the last time the index tracked at this mark, shortly before prices went on to climb over $500 higher.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect long-term bulls to buy this current dip in price?

Captains had been struggling with poor navigation since the onset of global trade. Though sailors could easily measure latitude by gauging the sun’s height, longitude was very hard to determine and inapt techniques veered vessels of course. Without visual bearings, humans were sailing blind on the open seas.
