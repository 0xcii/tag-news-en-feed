Here are some themes I’m seeing for Bitcoin in 2023.\nRegulatory Overreach\nThe Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule is forcing exchanges and bitcoin service providers to document and share ever-more information about customer transactions.

The “exchange whale ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 Bitcoin transactions to exchanges and the total exchange inflow.\n \nSince the ten largest deposits to exchanges are usually from the whales, this metric tells us what part of the total exchange inflows is being contributed by these humongous holders. Thus, when the value of the indicator is high, it means whales are making up a high part of the inflow…",

If I’m right the inflation problem is about to get much worse.\n \nSchiff also disagreed with Wharton University’s finance professor Jeremy Siegel who shared his economic view on CNBC last week.\n \n“Jeremy Siegel is wrong,” Schiff contended. Siegel “thinks falling real estate prices means the inflation threat is over. That’s falling asset prices. Consumer prices will keep rising, including those associated with homeownership like rent, mortgage rates, insurance, taxes, utilities, and maintenance,” Schiff argued.\n \nRegarding the stock market, Schiff predicted:\n \n\nThe worst-performing sectors of the stock market in 2022 will likely repeat as the worst-performing sectors in 2023.\n \nSchiff has repeatedly warned about the U.S. economy and the dollar crashing. In October, he cautioned about the rising national debt that the U.S. cannot repay. “We’re going to default,” he warned. “We have much more debt now than we had in 2008 … so this is going to be a much bigger crisis when the defaults start,” he described. The economist also predicted that the Federal Reserve’s recent actions could lead to market crashes, a massive financial crisis, and a severe recession.\n \nWhat do you think about economist Peter Schiff’s predictions?
