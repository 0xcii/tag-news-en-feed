It has been operating for over 10 years and is currently the benchmark for $20 billion worth of Bitcoin ETF assets.\nBy developing options contracts based on the XBX, the NYSE aims to provide investors with a new tool to manage risk as interest in Bitcoin continues growing. The products would be subject to regulatory approval.\nNYSE Chief Product Officer Jon Herrick said these new options contracts will give investors \"access to an important liquid and transparent risk-management tool\" amid surging demand for Bitcoin.\nThe collaboration brings another major traditional finance player into Bitcoin. The NYSE said it shows the \"wide-ranging enthusiasm\" for the recent spot bitcoin ETF approvals drawing institutions into the asset class.\n \n                         \n                         \n                        Image Subtext: Click the image to learn more. \n                     \n                    \nCurrently, the CME and a handful of other mainstream entities offer Bitcoin derivatives products.
