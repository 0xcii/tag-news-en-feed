With the market seeing declines over the past year, the mining industry has taken a hit when it comes to its profitability. This is evidenced by multiple miners going bankrupt while others continue to struggle to keep the lights on. With prices so low, it looks like it is more profitable to mine the meme coin than the OG bitcoin.\n \nDogecoin’s Profitability Is 480% Higher Than Bitcoin\n \nThe mining profitability chart from CoinWarz shows that while the mining profitability has stayed mostly flat for bitcoin over the last 14 days, Dogecoin has been seeing a rise.

According to their most recent December update, the company is “continuing to explore alternatives to mitigate the impact of the dispute with the third-party energy supplier to the site, including through organic and inorganic growth opportunities.” \nHut 8 has indicated that it fully intends to resolve the issues and restart operations as soon as possible, whether that be through a resolution involving Validus, or, as the company indicated, a potential alternative power supplier.",
