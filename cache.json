          "description": "Per a report from Semafor, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has been weighing on the possibility of filing fraud charges against crypto exchange Binance. The company has been in the eye of all major regulators worldwide in 2023 and might be about to face its biggest legal hurdle to date.\n \n \nBinance At Risk Of Bank Run?\n \nAccording to people familiar with the matter quoted by Semafor, the DOJ has been reluctant to file fraud charges for fear that this could trigger a “bank run.” In other words, the authorities are allegedly worried for investors and their funds if the crypto company becomes insolvent following a massive capital exodus.\n \nIf this happens, Binance will become the second major crypto exchange to face a bank run in over a year. In 2022, bankrupt exchange FTX faced a similar situation when reports about its financial state began circulating, leaving thousands of users with their funds “stuck” on the platform.\n \nIn that sense, the DOJ authorities are looking to implement other options, such as fines or an agreement with the company, Semafor wrote. As of this writing, there is no official statement from Binance or its top executives.\n \nThe company is currently facing a legal battle with U.S. regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint against the crypto platform and its U.S. subsidiary over allegedly violating securities laws.\n \nThis has negatively impacted Binance.US market share. If the DOJ proceeds with the fraud charges, the international arm could suffer a similar fate, confirming fears of a major bank run on the platform.\n \nOn this possibility, pseudonym crypto trader “Hsaka” stated: “The same run they’ve been trying to unsuccessfully ignite for the past few months?”\n \n \nAs of this writing, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market are negatively reacting to the news with the price of top coins tumbling into critical support levels.\n \n \nCover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview",

The wider market cap was mostly higher in today’s session, led by the optimism surrounding Microstrategy’s latest bitcoin investment. Chainlink also jumped higher after recent losses. \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) bounced back higher during Wednesday’s session, as the token moved away from a recent four-week low.\n \nAfter plunging to a bottom $0.6751 on Tuesday, MATIC/USD rallied to a peak of $0.7022 earlier in the day.\n \nThe move came as bulls rejected a breakout below a recent price floor of $0.6750, which coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) pushing away from its own support level.\n \n \nAfter racing from the aforementioned point at 43.00, the index made an attempt to reach resistance of 45.00.\n \nHowever, at the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 44.06, with MATIC back below $0.7000.\n \nOverall, momentum appears to be bearish, with the token falling for five of the last seven sessions.\n \n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nIn addition to polygon, chainlink (LINK) rebounded from a recent losing streak which resulted in price hitting a one-week low.\n \nLINK/USD leaped to an intraday high of $7.70 during today’s session, following a drop to a low of $7.40 the day prior.\n \nYesterday’s decline pushed chainlink below a support point of $7.50, and to its weakest level since July 26.\n \n \nLINK has managed to recover from its earlier drop, as the RSI climbed away from its own floor at the 55.00 zone.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 56.78, and appears to be making a move towards a ceiling of 60.00.\n \nIn the event that this level is hit, there is a good chance that LINK moves above $7.80.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould chainlink hit $8.00 by this time next week?
