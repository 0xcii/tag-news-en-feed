The crypto exchange said it expects as many as 80,000 participants and has promised a reward of just over $64 for those completing the course. \n \nImproving the Public’s Knowledge and Understanding of Cryptocurrencies\n \nAn Australian cryptocurrency exchange, Swyftx, said it plans to financially reward users who participate and complete learning courses offered via its crypto education platform. Known as “Earn and Learn,” the platform, which was formally launched on Sept. 6, represents the crypto exchange’s attempt to improve the public’s knowledge and understanding of cryptocurrencies.\n \nAccording to a recent report, Swyftx’s courses will cover different cryptocurrency scams and how users can identify them. Tom Matthews, who heads the crypto exchange’s corporate affairs, said the educational initiative also seeks to make users tough targets for scammers.\n \n\n \nAs recently reported by Bitcoin.com News, cybercriminals are thought to have stolen nearly $1 billion via scams, rug pulls and exploits in just the first eight months of 2023. Criminals are believed to have used the same modus operandi to steal close to $46 million in the month of August alone.\n \nTherefore, in order to help users avoid falling for similar crypto scams or compromised projects, Swyftx said its educational courses will include a checklist for evaluating tokens and crypto projects.\n \nFor users who complete the course, Swyftx is promising a reward of just over $64 (AUD100) while those who complete the initial fundamental analysis course will receive $3.2 worth of BTC.

Further, they are facing a judicial penalty of 135 million liras (about $5 million).  \n\nThodex's CEO Goes to Jail\nIt was part of an extensive trial of 21 defendants facing up to 40,564 years in prison. On Thursday, the Anatolian 9th Heavy Penal Court acquitted 16 defendants and released another four due to a lack of evidence. The rest of the defendants faced varying sentencing for the charges set against them.  \n\nThodex was the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Turkey until the exchange suddenly went offline in April 2021. Özer immediately went missing, but the authorities arrested his brother, sister, and four other senior employees and detailed at least 83 other people.  \n\nThe exchange had around 400,000 clients when it shuttered, out of which 390,000 were actively trading cryptocurrencies. Before going offline, the exchange was handling crypto trading volumes of more than $585 million, according to CoinMarketCap.com data. It was estimated to be holding cryptocurrency deposits of about $2 billion.   \n\nSerious Charges against Thodex CEO  \n\nÖzer was later arrested in Albania in August 2022 after an Interpol red notice was issued against him. He was extradited to Turkey last April over seven charges, including creating and running a criminal organization, being part of a criminal organization, cheating by using information systems as a tool of banks or credit institutions, deceiving merchants or company executives and cooperative managers, and hiding the value of assets that come from crime.  \n\nHe was further sentenced to seven months and 15 days in prison in July for failing to submit certain documents demanded by the Turkish Tax Inspection Board, Finance Magnates earlier reported.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.",
