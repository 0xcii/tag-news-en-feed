Xrp was also mostly in the green in today’s session, extending recent gains in the process. The global crypto market cap is trading 0.17% higher as of writing.\n \nCosmos (ATOM)\n \nCosmos (ATOM) raced to a two-month high on Wednesday, as the token climbed to its strongest point since November.\n \nFollowing a low of $11.10, ATOM/USD raced to a peak of $11.44 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of this latest surge in price, cosmos moved to its highest point since Nov. 12.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, today’s rally occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) ventured deeper into overbought territory.\n \nIn addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average (MA), continued its upward ascent versus the 25-day (blue) MA.\n \nHowever, sentiment could soon be shifting, with bears looking to re-enter the market as the RSI is now tracking at a level not seen since last January.\n \n \nXRP\n \nXRP (formerly ripple) was another big mover in today’s session, extending recent gains to a fourth consecutive day.\n \nSo far on Thursday, XRP/USD has risen to an intraday high of $0.3691, which comes less than a day after hitting a bottom of $0.348.\n \nFollowing this rally, xrp neared a four-week high, as prices moved to their highest point since December 16.\n \n \nThis latest price surge comes as the RSI moved beyond a resistance point at 57.00, and it is currently tracking at 59.41.\n \nAs a result of this move, the 10-day (red) moving average is now close to a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nShould this upwards cross occur, it is likely that XRP will continue to move towards its long-term target of $0.40.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect xrp to move closer to $0.40 this week?

Thursday’s report is expected to show that consumer prices have fallen to 6.5%, down from 7.1% the month prior. Ethereum also rose marginally higher in the day.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) rallied above a key resistance level on Wednesday, ahead of tomorrow’s U.S. inflation report.\n \nFollowing a low of $17,226.64 on Tuesday, BTC/USD raced to a peak of $17,493.32 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of the move, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed to its strongest point since December 15.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, today’s price surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a resistance point at the 60.00 mark.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 63.80. This comes as BTC continues to hover around its own ceiling at the $17,400 mark.\n \nIn order to move closer to the $18,000 zone, the RSI will first need to move beyond a ceiling of 64.00 on the RSI.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) was also marginally higher in today’s session, with prices continuing to trade below a long-term ceiling\n \nETH/USD hit a high of $1,342.76 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,324.97.\n \nOverall, ethereum remains below a resistance point of $1,350, with many expecting prices to move after the release of U.S. inflation figures tomorrow.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, the consolidation below this price ceiling comes as the RSI continues to trade under a hurdle of its own.\n \nPrice strength is now tracking at the 68.73 level, which is under a point of resistance at the 70.00 mark.\n \nETH bulls are likely still targeting a move beyond $1,400, however, in order for this to happen, the RSI level of 70.00 must first be overcome.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill cryptocurrency prices surge following the release of inflation figures?
