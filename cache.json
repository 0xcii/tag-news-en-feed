The selected cryptocurrency is then converted into dollars, covering the total amount due along with applicable fees, before being remitted to the DMV.\nHowever, it's important to note that there is a service fee associated with using cryptocurrency, amounting to $1 plus 1.83% of the total DMV charges. Additionally, PayPal may apply its own fees. As of now, PayPal is the sole cryptocurrency provider accepted for online DMV payments.\nFor those interested in learning more about this development and how to use Bitcoin or cryptocurrency for DMV transactions, you can visit the official Colorado DMV website here.",
