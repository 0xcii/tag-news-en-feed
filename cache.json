Toncoin was another notable gainer, climbing by over 6% today.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was a strong gainer on Tuesday, as the token rose by as much as 8% in today’s session.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.5634 to start the week, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.6127 earlier today.\n \nAs a result of today’s surge in price, the world’s fifth largest cryptocurrency rose to its highest level since August 15.\n \n \nToday’s move saw XRP climb for a third straight day, pushing the token close to a ceiling of $0.6400.\n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the relative strength index (RSI) has broken a resistance point of 73.00, and is now sitting at 75.08.\n \nIn order to reach the aforementioned resistance level, the index will likely need to reach a ceiling at or above 80.00.\n \n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin (TON) was another notable gainer on Tuesday, climbing to a one-month high during the day.\n \nTON/USD hit a high of $2.23 earlier in the day, which comes a day after trading at a low of $2.09.\n \nOwing to the move, toncoin rose to its highest point since September 28, when price was above $2.30.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, recent gains have pushed price strength above a ceiling at 59.00, and the index is now tracking at 61.62.\n \nThe next visible point of resistance is at the 71.00 point, and if hit, there is a good chance TON moves towards $2.60.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect toncoin to rise above $2.60 in the coming days?
