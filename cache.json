He expressed confusion and frustration over how the SEC differentiates between cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Cardano. His challenge was not just rhetorical but also deeply rooted in the legal framework, specifically the Howey test, used to determine if an asset qualifies as a security.\n \nHe stated, “Then they [the SEC] comes in and says it is a security.

This achievement garnered the miner a total of 6.887 BTC, inclusive of the 6.25 BTC subsidy and transaction fees.\n \nSolo Miner’s Slim Odds Pay Off: Claims Bitcoin Block Reward With Mere 2 PH/s Hashrate\n \n\n \nEchoing a similar event from the end of October, this miner, also affiliated with Solo Ckpool, successfully mined the block. Ckpool is designed to support independent miners, allowing them to retain the entire block reward, unlike other pools where rewards are shared.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCon Kolivas, the developer overseeing Solo Ckpool, remarked that this was the 279th block successfully mined by the pool. He noted the rarity of such an event, stating, “A miner of this size would solve a block on average only once every 5 years,” underscoring the miner’s extraordinary luck in this instance.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFor context, the Bitcoin network’s total hashpower stands at approximately 488 exahash per second (EH/s), or 488 quintillion hashes per second. In comparison, the solo miner’s contribution of 2 PH/s, or 2 quadrillion hashes, represents a mere 0.0004% of the network’s collective hashpower, highlighting the improbability of their success.\n \n\n \nWhat do you think about the solo miner discovering a block with such a small amount of hashrate?
