After more than two years, XRP holders finally received their FLR tokens on January 9, 2023, even if not completely as hoped, as Bitcoinist reported.\n \nThe most renowned exchanges like Binance and Kraken have supported the distribution of the airdrop, though there is one exception: Coinbase. The American exchange has not distributed the FLT to its users.\n \nBut the XRP community around lawyer Frederick Rispoli does not accept this and has brought a class action lawsuit against Coinbase and its CEO Brian Armstrong.\n \nLead plaintiff Dallas Woody is represented by the law firm Hodl Law, which, led by…",
