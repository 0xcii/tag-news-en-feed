          "description": "A recent report from Scam Sniffer, an anti-scam solution, revealed that MS Wallet Drainer, a cryptocurrency malware tool, has managed to siphon over $58 million in crypto since March. The drainer uses Google search and X ads phishing links as a distribution vector and has affected over 63,000 victims as of December 21.\nMS Drainer Allows Criminals to Siphon Over $58 Million\nA recent report from Scam Sniffer, an anti-scam platform used by several Web3 wallets, has revealed that a certain malware type has managed to siphon over $58 million from cryptocurrency holders. The tool, called MS Wallet Drainer, attacks the cryptocurrency wallets (Ethereum, BNB, and other EVM chains and rollups) of victims using Google and X ads to infect their devices and drain them of any available funds and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nThe malware is distributed using the search results of Google searches for popular cryptocurrency sites and decentralized finance exchanges, such as Zapper, Lido, Stargate, Defillama, Orbiter Finance, and Radiant. The same malware was also detected in a series of Ordinals-related X ads, and a recent sampling of X ads on some feeds resulted in more than 60% of the ads leading to sites using the MS Drainer.\nThe report highlights that these ads use several techniques to obfuscate their purposes and pass advertising audits. For example, they only target certain regions and use redirection to bypass revisions.\nOne of the victims lost over $24 million in an Ethereum wallet, while another lost over $1 million in Ethereum assets. An investigation revealed that the tool is available in darknet forums with a price of $1,500 for a standard functionality set. While other similar malware tools are fully managed and charge a 20% fee, this one only charges for modules that add additional functionality to the standard package.\nWhat do you think about the MS Wallet Drainer and its usage of Google and X phishing ads as a distribution method?

          "description": "On Dec. 24, 2023, Bitcoin shattered yet another daily transaction milestone, with miners confirming 723,459 transfers in a single day. The transaction rate on Christmas Eve exceeded the former peak of 710,579 verifications on Nov. 19, 2023.\n \nBitcoin’s Festive Feat — Record Transactions and Hashrate Soar on Christmas Eve\n \n\n \nThroughout the festive weekend, the Bitcoin network set two fresh records. On Christmas Eve, the network achieved a historic high with 723,459 bitcoin transactions confirmed by miners in a single day. It surpassed the previous high of 710,579 set 36 days earlier by an impressive margin of 12,880 transactions. The marked surge in daily transactions on Dec. 24 primarily stemmed from Ordinal inscriptions, contributing a considerable volume of the day’s transfers.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nDune Analytics data indicates that about 439,505 Ordinal inscriptions were verified on Sunday. Consequently, inscriptions outpaced traditional financial transfers, making up 60.75% of all transactions on Christmas Eve 2023. The previous record from Nov. 19 now ranks as the second highest, with Dec. 3, 2023, trailing as the third with 707,876 transfers.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBeyond setting a daily transaction record on Christmas Eve, bitcoin (BTC) miners also achieved a new pinnacle in the network’s total hashrate. The cumulative hashrate soared to 546 exahash per second (EH/s) on Dec. 24, climbing from 538 EH/s the previous day as network difficulty breached 72 trillion. This rate translates to 546 quintillion hashes per second (H/s) or 0.546 zettahash per second (ZH/s). From Jan. 1, 2023, to date, the hashrate has escalated by 311 EH/s.\n \n\n \nWhat do you think about Bitcoin confirming 723,459 transactions in one day?
