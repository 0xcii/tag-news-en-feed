          "description": "Nigeria’s once-tepid stance on cryptocurrency has taken a sharp turn towards prohibition. The Nigerian government, citing concerns over Naira manipulation, is proposing a ban on P2P (Peer-to-Peer) trading platforms that utilize the local currency. This move, coupled with ongoing legal battles with major exchanges, throws the future of Nigerian crypto into uncertainty.\n \n \nNaira Under Siege? The P2P Battleground\n \nThe Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleges that crypto participants and exchanges are manipulating the Naira’s value through P2P transactions. Emomotimi Agama, the newly appointed Director-General, suggests delisting the Naira from all P2P platforms as a remedy.\n \nAgama highlighted the government’s resolve to combat the perceived threat, saying:\n \n \n“This is one…",
