          "description": "The U.S. securities regulator recently announced a delay in its verdict on the Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF. Consequently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has marked January 10, 2024, as the decisive day to either greenlight or reject the proposed amendment.\n \nSEC Pushes Back Decision on 2 Spot Bitcoin ETFs\n \nA statement from the U.S. securities authority highlighted its decision to push back its judgment on the Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF, an asset-backed fund aiming for public listing. The filing for this ETF was jointly presented by Cboe BZX Exchange, 21shares, and Ark Invest on April 25, 2023.\n \nThis ETF joined the ranks of several spot bitcoin ETF applications, with industry giants like Invesco, Blackrock, Fidelity, Vaneck, Valkyrie, Wisdomtree, and Franklin Templeton all in the queue. Notably, the SEC had previously postponed its decision on seven of these filings, including the Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF, on August 31, 2023.\n \nUpon a detailed examination of the proposal and subsequent modifications, the SEC said on Tuesday that it chose to prolong the evaluation phase to guarantee a comprehensive review. “The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 3, and the issues raised therein,” the SEC detailed.\n \n \n“I’m shocked they went this early on Ark and 21Shares. My assumption is they’re worried about the government shutdown and trying to get ahead of that,” Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said on Tuesday. In addition to the Ark 21shares filing, the securities watchdog also deferred its decision on the spot bitcoin ETF filing submitted by Global X and its listing partner Cboe BZX.\n \nWhat do you think about the SEC’s recent delay on two spot bitcoin ETF registrations?

          "description": "Bitcoin cash was once again a big mover, as the cryptocurrency rose by nearly 10% during today’s session. The move saw price climb to its highest level since mid-August, and came as U.S. dollar strength pushed the S&P 500 to a three-month low. Chainlink also rallied strongly on Wednesday.\n \nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n \nBitcoin cash (BCH) continued to climb higher for a third straight session on Wednesday, as prices surged by nearly 10% in today’s session.\n \nBCH/USD peaked at $234.94 earlier in the day, which comes a day after falling to a low of $211.95.\n \nThis is the strongest point that the token has hit since August 10, when price was trading above $240.00.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the move came following a breakout of a point of resistance at the $225.00 level.\n \nAdditionally, the relative strength index (RSI) also broke out of a ceiling at 60.00, and is now tracking at 65.52.\n \nThe next target now seems to be at the $250.00 mark, which could be hit if current momentum extends for the remainder of the week.\n \n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nIn addition to BCH, chainlink (LINK) was also in the green on Wednesday, rising to a multi-week high of its own.\n \nAfter falling to a low of $7.26 on Tuesday, LINK/USD surged to an intraday high of $7.82 during today’s session.\n \nLike with bitcoin cash above, today’s peak pushed the cryptocurrency to its highest level since August 9.\n \n \nOverall, the rise occurred as price strength moved past a resistance level of 67.00, with a current reading of 67.22.\n \nLINK bulls are now likely looking to hit a ceiling of $8.00, as the 10-day (red) moving average maintains a recent uptrend.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould LINK reach $8.00 this week?
