Courts are an effective weapon as time alone often defeats the target entity and freezes the market,” he tweeted. He goes on to claim that the real goal of this “war” is not against crypto itself but rather that “crypto is the prize.”\n \nCrypto Insider Unveils Vendetta Against SEC\n \nUpon his vocal return to X (formerly Twitter) in mid-September, Nerayoff sparked a vendetta against the SEC with a range of assertions.

Both tokens have been experiencing extreme volatility in the crypto market, with sentiment and data surrounding Shibarium constantly shifting.\n \nOne of the key indicators reflecting the network’s recent challenges is the total value locked (TVL).
