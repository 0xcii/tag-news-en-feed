Although the exact financials of the deal were not revealed, it was labelled a “multi-million dollar sponsorship deal.”\nCrypto Money Is Flowing into Football\nThe sponsorship deal with Inter Milan came only a few days after BlockDAG spent $10 million to partner with Borussia Dortmund (BVB), one of Germany’s largest football clubs. For Inter Milan, it was the second crypto deal, as the football club had already onboarded Gate.io as its sleeve sponsor.\n“This collaboration not only enhances our brand but also positions us at the forefront of blockchain adoption in mainstream sports,” said Antony Turner, CEO of BlockDAG, …",
