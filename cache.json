          "description": "They say time heals all wounds – not in Bitcoin.\nAs documented by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo, tomorrow marks the 12th anniversary of a now-infamous tweet by Nick Allen back in 2011, one that demonstrates the remarkable growth and resilience of the cryptocurrency over the past decade.\nThe tweet in question, posted on October 25, 2011, by technologist Nick Allen, expressed disbelief at Bitcoin's value, which was \"down to $2.70 a pop.\" Allen went on to say he was \"so glad I didn't buy in on that mess.\"\nAt the time of the tweet, Bitcoin was trading at $2, and it's up some 1,600,000 percent since that date.\nFast forward to today, and Bitcoin's price has soared to nearly $35,000 per coin, marking a phenomenal increase from the days when it was valued in the single digits. Allen's tweet has since become a symbol of how the cryptocurrency has defied expectations and evolved into a mainstream asset class.\n \n         \n         \n         \n        Allen's responded to the post in 2021, at a time when Bitcoin was down from $60,000 all-time highs. \n    \nNick Allen, who has an extensive background in the gaming and esports industry, may not have anticipated the extraordinary growth of Bitcoin when he posted his tweet, but the incredible price increase highlights the digital currency's journey and the increasing interest in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate investment vehicle.\nStill, as recent news stories show, Allen is not alone when it comes to believing Bitcoin is a fad whose best days are behind it. While some are excited about the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, there has been a continued barrage of news stories in the wake of the FTX trial that take a similar tone.\nIn this way, Allen's tweet may serve as a reminder that Bitcoin has a history of defying its doubters – and rewarding its investors.",

The global crypto market cap is nearly 10% higher at the time of writing, with the likes of bitcoin trading at a 17-month high. Cardano also surged, recording a 2-month peak.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was one of Tuesday’s biggest movers, as the token rose by as much as 10% today.\n \nAfter trading at a low of $0.5267 on Monday, XRP/USD climbed to a peak of $0.581 earlier in the day.\n \nThis surge resulted in XRP rising to its highest point since August 18, when price was on the cusp of breaking into the $0.60 region.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the move came after the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nShould bulls intend to maintain this recent round of momentum, they will first need to break a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI) of 72.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 71.70.\n \n \nCardano (ADA )\n \nAdditionally, cardano (ADA) rallied to a multi-month high during today’s session, breaking a key resistance level in the process.\n \nADA/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $0.2911 on Tuesday, after starting the week trading at a low of $0.2626.\n \nToday’s surge in price has sent the cryptocurrency to its strongest level since August 13, and comes after six days of consecutive gains.\n \n \nThis has resulted in price strength now residing in overbought territory, with a current reading of 75.70.\n \nLooking back at the chart, this is the highest the index has hit since January, and was the catalyst for bulls to break a price ceiling of $0.280.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nIs the $0.30 level attainable in the coming days?
