          "description": "Binance, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has successfully integrated Bitcoin (BTC) onto the Lightning Network, enabling faster and more efficient transactions. As of today, users can now deposit and withdraw Bitcoin (BTC) using the Lightning Network on the Binance platform.\nThe integration of Bitcoin on the Lightning Network marks a significant milestone for Binance, as it aims to enhance the speed and scalability of Bitcoin transactions. By leveraging the Lightning Network, Binance aims to address the scalability challenges associated with the Bitcoin network, allowing users to enjoy faster and cheaper transactions. Previously, Binance has experienced issues in high fee environments, most recently highlighted when Bitcoin inscriptions caused a surge in fees. \nWith the Lightning Network integration, Binance users can now take advantage of the Lightning Network's off-chain payment channels to send and receive bitcoin transactions with reduced fees and faster settlement times. This development comes just as Lightning is being integrated into other exchange platforms, essentially becoming an expectation for quick and easy bitcoin transactions. Just last week, a European exchange named Coinfinity also integrated the Lightning Network, with plans for further integration down the road. \nAccording to the official announcement by Binance, users can find their assigned bitcoin deposit addresses on the Lightning Network within the Deposit Crypto page on the platform. The exchange has also provided a FAQ section to guide users on how to deposit bitcoin using the Lightning Network.\nThe integration of the Lightning Network for bitcoin transactions is expected to bring tangible benefits to Binance users, offering them a faster and more cost-effective way to engage with the leading cryptocurrency.",

          "description": "Geyser, a leading Bitcoin grant organization, has announced the launch of its fifth Bitcoin grant, aimed at supporting educational initiatives and community-based programs focused on Bitcoin. The grant opens up opportunities for campaigns that promote and bolster Bitcoin schools and communities worldwide. \nMick Morucci, CEO of Geyser, emphasized the importance of Bitcoin for underserved populations, stating, \"These are the people that would most benefit from bitcoin, which can act as a shield. These are also those that are least aware of bitcoin.\" The grant seeks to amplify the efforts of Bitcoin communities that are emerging across the globe, offering knowledge, education and tools to promote participation in the Bitcoin movement.\nTo fund the grant, Geyser has raised 1 BTC, thanks to generous donors and a partnership with Blink. The organization aims to distribute the proceeds to numerous projects that demonstrate impact, need and proof of work. Applications for the grant are currently open and will be accepted until mid-August. A board will evaluate the projects and select the most deserving recipients.\nGeyser Grants stands apart from typical Bitcoin grants, which primarily focus on core developers. The organization aims to recognize and reward all Bitcoin creators for their contributions. Geyser Grants has already made a significant impact, contributing 2.2 BTC to over 100 projects centered around Bitcoin education, creative endeavors, and community building.\nThe grants serve multiple purposes, including promoting Bitcoin awareness, encouraging contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem, recognizing important work in the space, empowering creators globally and fostering the growth of the Bitcoin creator ecosystem. To learn more about the grant or to apply, interested individuals can visit the Geyser Grants Round 5 page.",

However, it now sits at 52.94.\n \nThe next visible floor appears to be at 50.00, and should it reach this point, ethereum will likely be trading below $1,900.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \n Do you expect ethereum to rebound in the coming days?
