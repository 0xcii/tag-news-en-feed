          "description": "According to the onchain analyst Zachxbt, 4,800 bitcoins taken from the now-defunct darknet marketplace Abraxas were transferred to a bitcoin mixing service. Abraxas exit scammed in November 2015 after less than a year, and the bitcoins had remained untouched since then.\n \n$144M in Bitcoin from 2015 Abraxas Scandal Suddenly Moved to Mixer\n \nZachxbt reported on the social media site X (formerly Twitter) that the 4,800 bitcoins, valued at $144 million, from an Abraxas wallet were moved to a mixing service.\n \n“An entity moved ~4800 BTC ($144M) originating from Abraxas darknet market which exit scammed in Nov 2015 after previously sitting dormant,” the analyst said on Monday. “They consolidated funds and also deposited [them into] a bitcoin mixer,” Zachxbt added.\n \n \nWhen Abraxas defrauded its customers and vendors, bitcoin was trading at $386 per unit on the day the marketplace disappeared. This means the stolen bitcoins from Abraxas were worth about $1.85 million at that time.\n \nAbraxas began its operations roughly at the same time as the notorious darknet marketplaces Alphabay and Agora, launching on Dec. 13, 2014. Data from gwern.net shows that the site became inaccessible on Nov. 5, 2015, and the bitcoin wallets were emptied in March 2016.\n \n \nFollowing Abraxas’ exit scam, vendors and marketplace users frantically looked for new darknet marketplaces. In the process, several of these new platforms also defrauded their users. Research indicates that Agora also shut down around that period, leading both Agora and Abraxas users to migrate to Alphabay.\n \nSubsequently, Alphabay rapidly became the leading DNM until law enforcement seized it in July 2017. The reason for the recent movement of the Abraxas bitcoin stash remains unknown, except for the fact that the funds are now worth $142 million more than they were in 2015.\n \nWhat do you think about the Abraxas’ bitcoin moving?

Previously, it was widely believed that Salvadoran presidents were limited to a single five-year term.

          "description": "Renowned financial educator and author of the best-selling book \"Rich Dad Poor Dad,\" Robert Kiyosaki, has once again made a bold prediction regarding the future of Bitcoin, suggesting that the cryptocurrency's price is on a trajectory to reach $130,000. \nKiyosaki's pronouncement on X comes amid his growing concerns about inflation and a shifting global economic landscape.\nIn a recent tweet, Kiyosaki shared his insights on various assets, including Bitcoin, gold, and silver. He started by forecasting a bullish future for gold, stating, \"Gold will soon break through $2,100 and then take off.\"\nKiyosaki's optimism about gold stems from the precious metal's historical role as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. His forecast suggests a significant increase in the value of gold, which has been catching the attention of investors as a traditional store of value.\nHowever, what grabbed the attention of the Bitcoin community and investors was Kiyosaki's next prediction. He asserted, \"Bitcoin testing $30,000. Next stop Bitcoin $135,000.\" This statement underscores Kiyosaki's belief in the potential of Bitcoin to not only recover from recent price fluctuations but to surge to new all-time highs.\nDespite periodic market volatility, Bitcoin has maintained its status as the leading digital asset and is seen by many as a store of value and a hedge against global economic instability.\nAs investors and financial experts continue to navigate the complex financial landscape, Kiyosaki's forecasts serve as a reminder of the growing interest in alternative assets like Bitcoin and precious metals.",

          "description": "In a surprising twist in Argentina's presidential election, pro-Bitcoin candidate Javier Gerardo Milei has emerged as a formidable contender, forcing a run-off election against current Economy Minister Sergio Massa after the first round of voting.\nJavier Milei, a libertarian economist who has vowed to shut down the nation's central bank and expressed support for Bitcoin, managed to secure 31.2% of the vote, a remarkable achievement for a candidate with limited prior political exposure. \nMilei's passionate advocacy for economic reform have resonated with a significant portion of the electorate. In August, Milei won the most votes in the country's primary election, a fact owed to the nation's ongoing economic crisis.\nIn past remarks, Milei has said he will address Argentina's chronic economic woes, a message struck a chord with disillusioned voters. Argentina's annual inflation rate was 124.4% in August, its highest level since 1991.\nThe upcoming run-off election, slated for November 19th, will see Milei face off against Sergio Massa, who secured 46.7% of the vote in the first round, but missed the majority threshold needed to claim victory outright. In order to win outright, either candidate would have needed to claim 40% of the vote, and to lead his political opponent by 10% of the vote, owing to election rules.\nThe outcome of the run-off could have a profound impact on Argentina's economic policies and its role in the global cryptocurrency landscape.\nInvestors and crypto enthusiasts worldwide are closely watching this electoral showdown, anticipating its potential implications on the adoption of Bitcoin, and whether the nation could follow El Salvador's landmark legal tender law, which in 2021 made the cryptocurrency a payment method across the country.",
