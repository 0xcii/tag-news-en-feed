Traders have moved to secure recent gains, ahead of September’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Polygon was also in the green, hitting a two-week high in the process.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was a notable gainer in today’s session, as the token raced to a multi-week high.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.5092 on Tuesday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday peak at $0.5233 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of the surge in price, XRP climbed to its highest point since August 31, when price peaked at $0.5285.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the move came as the relative strength index (RSI) broke free of a ceiling at 48.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 50.66, with bulls possibly targeting a ceiling at 58.00.\n \nIn the event traders reach this target, there is a strong chance XRP will move above $0.5500.\n \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nIn addition to XRP, polygon (MATIC) also surged to a multi-week high on Wednesday, despite market uncertainty ahead of the Fed announcement.\n \nMATIC/USD peaked at $0.5486 earlier in today’s session, after rebounding from a low of $0.536 the day before.\n \nThe move pushed polygon to its strongest level since September 8, when the token reached a high of $0.5586.\n \n \nEarlier gains have since faded, and this appears to be due to the RSI failing to break out of its ceiling at the 49.00 mark.\n \nCurrently, price strength sits at 47.34, however momentum remains largely bullish, ahead of a potential moving average crossover.\n \nThe 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) trend lines are on the cusp of an upwards cross, which could trigger a fresh price surge.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould polygon hit $0.6000 before the end of the month?
