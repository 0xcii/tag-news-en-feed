The move came following several attempts over several weeks, with bulls finally breaking through. Polygon was also higher, ending a recent losing streak. \n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nLitecoin (LTC) was one of Thursday’s notable gainers, as prices moved past a key resistance level.\n \nFollowing a low of $88.35 on Thursday, LTC/USD rose to an intraday peak at $94.21 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of today’s rally, litecoin broke out of its recent ceiling at $93.00, hitting a two-week high in the process.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that Thursday’s surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 58.00.\n \nSince the breakout, the index has continued to climb, and as of writing this is currently tracking at 59.76.\n \nIn the event momentum continues in this direction, there is a strong chance that LTC will move above $95.00.\n \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) snapped a three-day losing streak on Thursday, following a crossover of moving averages (MA).\n \nThe 10-day (red) MA crossed its 25-day (blue) counterpart in today’s session, sending the price to a peak of $0.8974.\n \nThis comes following Wednesday’s low at $0.8787, which saw MATIC hit its weakest point since May 25.\n \n \nOverall, market volatility in polygon remains significantly high, with earlier gains almost fading.\n \nAs of writing, MATIC is trading at $0.8934, with the RSI at a reading of 46.03, which is close to a ceiling of 48.00.\n \nShould this aforementioned point of resistance be broken, bulls could force a move toward $0.9000.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect polygon to move above $0.9000 this week?
