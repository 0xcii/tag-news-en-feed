          "description": "US  \nprosecutors have fingered two Russian nationals as the masterminds behind the 2011 hack of  \nMt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin (BTC) exchange in the world at the time. The  \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) in an indictment unsealed on Friday, charged Alexey  \nBilyuchenko, 43, and Aleksandr Verner, 29, with conspiracy to launder about 647,000  \nbitcoins following their hack of the  \nexchange. \nDOJ Indicts Two Russian Nationals\nAccording  \nto the prosecutors, Bilyuchenko and Verner stole the vast majority of bitcoins  \nbelonging to Mt. Gox customers between September 2011 and at least May 2014. This contributed to the eventual shut down  \nof the platform in February 2014. \nThe DOJ in  \na statement unsealed charges against both Russian nationals in both New York  \nand California, following ongoing multi-agency investigation into the case.  \nThis is even as the prosecutor accused Bilyuchenko of partnering with Alexander Vinnik to run  \nanother defunct Bulgaria-based cryptocurrency exchange, BTC-e, with ‘ill-gotten  \ngains’ from his Mt. Gox hack.\nBTC-e, according  \nto the prosecutor, for years aided criminals across the world, ‘to launder  \nbillions of dollars.’ These included computer hackers, ransomware actors,  \nnarcotics rings and corrupt public officials. \n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Solomon Oladipupo at www.financemagnates.com.",
