          "description": "BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with nearly $9 trillion in assets under management, has made significant strides toward embracing bitcoin, as indicated by its recent filing for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The company’s decision to take steps to offer its clients exposure to the digital asset are likely to bring a surge of institutional adoption to the space.\nThe company also recently resubmitted their filing after the SEC responded that the initial filings required more information in regards to the exchange’s involved, subsequently adding Coinbase to the filing, as other firms refiling did.\nAnd now, BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, has made an appearance on Fox Business where he stated that the role of bitcoin and crypto is “digitizing gold.” \n“Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation … or the devaluation of your currency … [bitcoin] can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative,” Fink stated. The description reinforces the perception of bitcoin as a store of value, akin to the role gold has traditionally played in investment portfolios. By likening bitcoin to gold, Fink acknowledges the international nature of the digital asset, highlighting its potential as a global store of wealth — and indeed, during his news appearance, Fink further emphasized that, \"Bitcoin is an international asset.\" \nThe televised statement underscores the conviction Fink, and likely BlackRock, have in bitcoin and its potential role in the future. Fink's recognition of bitcoin's international appeal further bolsters the case for increased institutional interest and investment.\nBlackRock's pursuit of a Bitcoin ETF and Fink's endorsement of bitcoin as digitized gold reflect a notable shift in the attitude of major financial institutions toward bitcoin. These developments suggest that BlackRock, along with other industry giants, recognizes the potential of bitcoin to reshape the financial landscape.",

          "description": "Throughout the past week, the Bitcoin blockchain has successfully confirmed over 187,000 unconfirmed transactions, as shown by recent statistics. This has not only reduced a significant portion of the congestion but also led to a decrease in onchain fees within the same period.\n \nBitcoin Fees and Unconfirmed Transactions Slide Lower\n \nAlthough Bitcoin’s backlog of transactions remains above 145,000, data indicates that miners have managed to clear more than half of the congestion during this week. Archived information from mempool.space reveals that on June 27, 2023, a total of 332,508 pending transactions awaited confirmation.\n \nAdditionally, a high-priority onchain fee would cost users $1.29 per transaction, with 194 blocks needed to be mined to clear 100% of the backlog. With today’s backlog consisting of 145,240 transfers still pending, only 94 blocks must be mined to alleviate congestion.\n \n \nAs of July 5, 2023, data demonstrates that a high-priority transaction fee is now $0.77 per transfer. Metrics also indicate that daily onchain transaction confirmations range between 309,000 and 445,000. Current block times are faster than the previous ten-minute average at eight minutes and 40 seconds.\n \n \nOver the last week, data from bitinfocharts.com reflects a decline from an average of $2.73 per transaction to a current average of 0.000062 BTC or $1.87 per transaction. This represents a drop of 31% in average onchain fees during this time frame.\n \nMedian-sized fees have also decreased from $1.06 to 0.000025 BTC or $0.77 per transaction. In the meantime, the Ordinal inscription trend persists as inscriptions approach 15 million; approximately 14,834,677 inscriptions are linked to the Bitcoin blockchain at this time.\n \nAre these recent improvements in Bitcoin’s transaction confirmation and fee reduction indicative of a long-term solution to scalability challenges, or are they just temporary relief?
