While the incredible uptick has caused excitement among the broader crypto community, it has not been without its fluctuations. \n \nMiners Fueled BTC ATH Rally\n \nOn Tuesday, March 5, 2024, BTC hit a new all-time high, soaring to $69,200, and surpassing its previous peak in November 2021 when the price of the cryptocurrency traded at around $69,000.

The report, which would include options and recommendations for safely investing in the asset class, would be submitted to key state officials at least three months before the beginning of the Fifty-Seventh Legislature, First Regular Session.\nThe proposal aims to provide ASRS and PSPRS with the information needed to make informed decisions about integrating Bitcoin ETFs into their investment strategies, potentially diversifying their portfolios and exploring new avenues for growth.",
