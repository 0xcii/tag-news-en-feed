          "description": "Mike Alfred, a value investor, has ignited a debate with his prediction that XRP, the native currency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), will remain stagnant at around $0.60 even if Bitcoin soars to $250,000 for the first time. \n \nInvestor Claims XRP Is Not A Scam But Will Struggle For Growth\n \nIn a post on X, Alfred said though XRP is not an “outright scam like Hex,” there are similar concerns about its underlying mechanism. The value investor continued, adding that this assessment is because XRP functions primarily as a “token printing scheme” enriching founders and insiders. \n \nFor this reason, XRP, the cryptocurrency listed across multiple exchanges, has been flat-lining for the past seven years. The investor pinned this to the excessive token minting over the years.\n \n \nXRP and Ripple, the blo…",

          "description": "I wanted to share some thoughts on a seemingly overlooked innovation that has come to Bitcoin within the last year, called Bitpacs. \nBitpac stands for a Bitcoin Based Publicly Auditable Cooperative. Bitpacs are essentially normal bitcoin multisig wallets with the additional introduction of public auditability. Traditionally in a multisig setup, participants of the multisig are not disclosed. In a Bitpac multisig, participants are intentionally made public, which allows for transparent auditability. With this transparency, unique features, tooling, rules, and transaction crafting is possible. The goal of Bitpacs is to emulate the familiar DAO experience on other chains. \nDAO’s are marketed as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. However, Ethereum and other altcoin based DAOs only inherit…",
