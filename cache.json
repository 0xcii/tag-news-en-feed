Ethereum was also lower, as prices fell back below $1,900.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) moved lower to start the week, as cryptocurrency markets continued to react to the latest nonfarm payrolls report.\n \nThe number of jobs added to the U.S. economy came in higher than expected, in many’s eyes justifying the Federal Reserve’s decision to hike interest rates by 0.25%.\n \nAs a result, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $27,691.26 earlier in today’s session, following a peak of $29,119.38 the day prior.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nOverall, BTC has now fallen for a third straight session, with this latest drop sending prices to a one-week low.\n \nOne of the catalysts for the decline was a breakout which took place on the relative strength index (RSI), which fell below a floor at 47.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.32, with a floor of 42.00 a potential target for bears.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also in the red on Monday, with prices plunging below $1,900.\n \nFollowing a high of $1,934.00 on Sunday, ETH/USD dropped by almost $100, hitting a low of $1,839.89 earlier in the day.\n \nSimilar to bitcoin, today’s decline saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency fall for its third consecutive day.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nFrom the chart, it appears that ethereum bears are now attempting to take the RSI to its own point of support at 45.00.\n \nCurrently, the index is at the 47.02 level, having recently moved below a higher support point at 49.00.\n \nShould price strength hit the target of 45.00, there is a possibility that ETH will be trading under $1,800.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect further drops in ethereum this week?

          "description": "Spanish law enforcement recently nabbed three individuals who befriended and eventually kidnapped a Syrian cryptocurrency dealer. Following their arrest, the kidnappers, who were demanding a ransom of over $1.1 million, were found in possession of weapons and fake identity documents. \n \nSyrian Crypto Dealer’s Captors Were His Party Friends\n \nSpanish law enforcement recently freed a Syrian cryptocurrency dealer from three kidnappers that were demanding a ransom of $1.12 million (or €1 million). According to a report by a Spanish-language publication, the captured trio was set to appear in court on May 6 where they were expected to face kidnapping as well as illegal possession of weapons charges.\n \nAs revealed in the report, the unnamed Syrian crypto dealer had partied with the trio before the kidnapping. However, when they four met on May 3, the Hungary-based crypto dealer’s party friends pounced and started demanding the ransom money. According to the report, the crypto dealer whose company is based in Dubai, was told to access applications that he uses to manage his crypto business and to contact the intended recipient of the ransom money.\n \n \nHowever, whilst in captivity, the Syrian crypto dealer is said to have taken a picture through the window and sent this over to a colleague who was negotiating his release. The colleague, in turn, then sent this to the victim’s other acquaintance who then forwarded this to law enforcement.\n \nUpon receiving the information, Spanish law enforcement launched an investigation which eventually led to the raid on a luxury villa located in Benalmádena. In addition to finding weapons and gardening tools, law enforcement agents also found one of the kidnappers in possession of several fake identity documents. In addition, two of the Syrian crypto dealer’s captors had fake Greek Passports.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",
