The firm had teased this launch in mid-September, hinting that the machines would feature enhanced efficiency.\n \nThe M60 series includes an air-cooled variant, a hydro-cooled version, and an immersion-cooled model, each delivering an impressive efficiency of 18.5 J/T. The air-cooled M60S clocks in at 170 to 186 terahash per second (TH/s), whereas the hydro-cooled M63S ranges from 360 to 390 TH/s.\n \nDubbed the M66, the immersion-cooled miner churns out a notable 270 to 298 TH/s. This unveiling aligns with recent releases from the top trio of mining rig producers, all of whom have amped up their efficiency metrics.\n \nBitmain’s new S21 models range from 16 J/T to 17.5 J/T, with hashrates spanning 200 TH/s to 335 TH/s. Canaan’s newest Avalon 14 has an efficiency metric of 19.5 J/T, exclusive to its hydro-cooled version.\n \nThe Avalon 14 air-cooled counterpart registers at 21.5 J/T. These fresh offerings, with their elevated hashrates and optimized efficiency, are poised to supercharge the network’s cumulative hashrate.\n \nAs of October 23, 2023, Bitcoin’s seven-day simple moving average hashrate is coasting along at 452 exahash per second (EH/s). As bitcoin’s value surged this week, the network’s hash value, priced per petahash per second (PH/s), climbed to $72 per PH/s daily.\n \nWhat do you think about Microbt’s new Whatsminer bitcoin mining rigs?
