This latest publication marks the culmination of efforts, with  \nmore batches expected to follow as part of the consultation process.\nThe draft Regulatory Technical Standards released by the EBA  \ndelineate the stipulations, templates, and procedures for complaints received  \nby issuers of what MiCA defines as asset reference tokens (ARTs). Unlike  \ntraditional stablecoins, which are typically pegged to a single currency such  \nas the euro or US dollar, ARTs possess the flexibility to reference multiple  \ncurrencies or other assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\n🆕 #EBA final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) under #MiCAR 📜🔍These set out the requirements, templates and procedures for handling complaints received by issuers of asset reference tokens (ARTs) 🗂️📝https://t.co/yT3pSGSowh pic.twitter.com/DvycTm2MqI\n— EU Banking Authority - EBA 🇪🇺 (@EBA_News) March 13, 2024\nNotably, the MiCA regulation places a  \nsignificant emphasis on establishing stringent requirements for stablecoin  \nissuers. While the broader MiCA framework is slated to come into effect in  \nDecember, the regulations specific to stablecoins are anticipated to be  \nenforced as early as this summer. The regulatory landscape surrounding  \ncryptocurrencies has been evolving rapidly as authorities seek to balance  \ninnovation with investor protection and financial stability. \n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Tareq Sikder at www.financemagnates.com.",
