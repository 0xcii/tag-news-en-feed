          "description": "On Tuesday, Montenegro’s appeals court overturned the extradition request for Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon. This reversal follows reports that Justice Minister Andrej Milovic had informally agreed to the extradition.\n \nKwon to Remain in Montenegro, Decision Lies With Justice Minister\n \nFor the time being, Kwon is set to stay in Montenegro, as the Appeals Court Council, on Dec. 14, overturned the Higher Court in Podgorica’s decision to extradite him to the United States. The case has now been remanded to the lower court for a fresh evaluation and ruling.\n \nThe court’s decision to halt Kwon’s extradition was invalidated due to a violation of specific legal protocols as per the Montenegrin Criminal Procedure Code. Notably, the court exceeded its jurisdiction. In Montenegro, a court’s function in extradition matters is merely to verify the legal grounds for such a request.\n \nHowever, the power to actually suspend or defer the extradition of the ex-CEO of Terraform Labs is not within the court’s remit. This responsibility is solely vested in the Minister of Justice, following the Montenegrin legislation on international legal assistance in criminal matters. Here, the appeals court made a decision beyond its legal capacity, necessitating the annulment.\n \n \nConfronting significant legal challenges from both the U.S. and South Korea, Kwon has unwaveringly refuted all allegations of fraud. His charges, filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and South Korean financial authorities, include commodities fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit fraud and manipulate the market. The ultimate decision to approve or deny Kwon’s extradition lies with the Justice Minister.\n \nWhat do you think about the appeals court decision concerning Do Kwon’s extradition request?

The possible involvement of global networks like Visa and Mastercard in the stablecoin business will likely undermine the monetary independence of countries like South Korea. \n \nCentral Banks Urged to Prepare for Digitization\n \nThe growing use of stablecoins like USDT and USDC is posing a new threat to the operations of central banks and may be making monetary policies less effective, according to Rhee Chang-yong, the governor of the Bank of Korea. Speaking at a recent digital money conference, Chang-yong urged central banks to prepare for digitization if they wish to keep abreast with the fast-changing financial landscape.\n \nA Yonhap report states that the BOK governor believes global networks such as Visa and Mastercard’s likely involvement with stablecoins will undermine countries like South Korea’s monetary independence. Therefore, to stop stablecoins from wreaking havoc on his country’s capital inflows, Chang-yong proposed launching central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n \n“This underscores the urgency for central banks to consider introducing central bank digital currencies (CBDC), whether retail or wholesale,” the BOK governor reportedly said.\n \n \nWhile he conceded that retail CBDCs may have no clear advantage over regular payment methods, Chang-yong insisted that their programmability feature allows such digital currencies to bring with them “a realm of possibilities.” One such possibility is the execution of complex and conditional transactions automatically via smart contracts.\n \nMeanwhile, the BOK also revealed that South Korea, which has already launched a pilot project for a retail CBDC system, is working on a wholesale pilot project. The South Korean Central Bank’s partners for the project include the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and financial regulators.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
