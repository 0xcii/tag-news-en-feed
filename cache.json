The firm expects approval by mid-2024.\nUnlike previous bitcoin exchange-traded products in Australia, Monochrome's ETF would hold actual bitcoin. This structure mirrors the highly successful spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission has already greenlighted Monochrome's proposal. Cboe Australia is now reviewing the application.\n\"We anticipate a decision from Cboe Australia about the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF before the middle of 2024,\" said CEO Jeff Yew. \"The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF stands to be the first Bitcoin ETF in Australia authorized to hold Bitcoin directly.\"\nIf approved, the ETF would provide local investors with direct exposure to bitcoin through a regulated investment vehicle. Monochrome said it chose Cboe for its strategic expertise and extensive reach across Asia.\nThe firm had originally planned to list on rival exchange ASX, but it has since pivoted to Cboe's platform.\nAustralia joining the spot bitcoin ETF movement could further validate Bitcoin as an investable asset class, as Monochrome is aiming to tap surging institutional demand as the Bitcoin industry matures.\nThe fund's launch would arrive just before Bitcoin's next halving event, likely boosting interest. As the first to hold physical bitcoin, Monochrome could quickly dominate the local ETF space in Australia.",

The country has taken an institutional interest in Bitcoin, with its sovereign fund purchasing BTC since prices were around $5,000.\nBhutan announced last year it was raising $500 million to boost mining operations. By framing mining as both a commercial opportunity and crisis mitigation tool, Bhutan has embraced Bitcoin more fully than most nations. Its renewable hydropower reserves also make it an ideal location for eco-friendly mining.\nThe new investment in cutting-edge mining hardware comes as the Bitcoin network faces a halving in mid-April. The quadrennial event cuts block rewards for miners in half, impacting revenue.\nBhutan cited offsetting the halving's impact as a motivation for expanding its mining operations. Bitdeer has one of the lowest costs per Bitcoin mined in the industry at $20,000 per coin, far below the global average of up to $45,000.\nThe remote Himalayan nation has also viewed Bitcoin mining as a way to boost rural economies and jobs.",
