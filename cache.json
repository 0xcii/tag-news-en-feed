          "description": "On Wednesday, following the market’s closure, major U.S. indices concluded the day unchanged, coming off a rise the previous day. This surge was influenced by the dovish remarks made on Tuesday by Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller. Observers of the market infer that Waller’s comments indicate a potential shift in the stance of the U.S. central bank, a notable deviation given his usually hawkish perspective. Concurrently, the Federal Reserve’s latest ‘Beige Book’ report presented a more troubling outlook than its predecessor, pointing to decelerated economic expansion and a rise in consumer credit defaults.\n \nWaller’s Typical Hawkish Tone Turns Dovish\n \nTwo days prior, at the American Enterprise Institute, Christopher Waller of the Fed shared with participants that “inflation rate…",

To support the miners, Bitcoin needed something new to spur growth, and that was Ordinals. Ordinals drove huge demand to send Bitcoin transactions.
