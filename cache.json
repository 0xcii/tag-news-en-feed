Advertisers of such trusts must apply and get a certificate issued by Google before they start promoting their offerings to the public.\n \nAccording to Google, the so-called cryptocurrency coin trusts are financial products that enable investors to trade shares in trusts holding large pools of digital currency. Google, which has not provided a comprehensive list of the requirements, reminded advertisers they still need to adhere to relevant local regulations.\n \n“As a reminder, we expect all advertisers to comply with the local laws for any area that their ads target. This policy will apply globally to all accounts that advertise these products,” Google said.\n \n \nHowever, violation of this new policy will not result in the immediate suspension of advertisers’ respective accounts. Instead, a warning will be issued seven days before the account suspension. To learn more about how to obtain the certificate as well as the restrictions on financial products, Google has asked advertisers to visit its ads policy help page on its website.\n \nOn this page, Google lists country-specific requirements that advertisers for crypto-related products must satisfy before promoting their products.
