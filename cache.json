A recent Merge “upgrade” to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and other changes raised discussion of a possible “flippening” — a situation where Ethereum unseats Bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency in the market. \n \nInstead, Ethereum’s dominance could be in “grave” danger, if an ominous-sounding Japanese candlestick pattern is a prelude of what’s to come across the crypto market. \n \nLagging Performance Against Crypto Leaves ETH.D Exposed To Danger\n \nWhile Ethereum might be up by 90% from its bear market low compared to Bitcoin’s 50%, when comparing year-to-date returns BTC’s 50% gain against USD beats ETH’s mere 40%.
