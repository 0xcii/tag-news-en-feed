          "description": "Despite Bitcoin's decline, several alternative cryptocurrencies remain robust. Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness a $94 million outflow, although outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may decelerate. Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase's premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin's all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance. Solana's (SOL) decentralized exchange (DEX) achieves a monthly volume of $50 billion, with revenue soaring 30-fold. OKX announces support for a new Solana token standard. Despite expectations, Layer 2 activity remains sluggish post-Dencun, according to Vitalik Buterin.",

However, he cannot leave Montenegro as his passport has been held back.\nDo Kwon Released from Prison\n“We released Do Kwon from prison as his regular prison term for traveling with fake papers ended,” the Director of Montenegro, where Kwon was held, told the publication.\n“Since he is a foreign citizen and his documents are withheld, he was taken for an interview to the police directorate for foreigners, and they will deal with him further.”\nThe release came a day after the Balkan country's Supreme Court suspended a lower court's earlier decision for his extradition to South Korea, the native country of Kwon. The top court’s order came after the top prosecutor in the Balkan country challenged the previous lower court order, showing procedural errors.\nCrypto Mogul to a Fugitive\nKwon was known for building Terraform Labs. However, the two cryptocurrencies of the project, TerraUSD and Luna, collapsed in 2022, resulting in the wipeout of about $37 billion in value. The collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin triggered the shuttering and collapse of several other cryptocurrency companies.\nKwon disappeared immediately from public sight after the collapse of his company but was arrested in Montenegro last year while traveling with fake travel documents. Both South Korea and the United States have been trying to extradite him after his arrest. Although South Korea did not reveal the charges he would face, the US prosecutors are ready to slap eight charges against him.\nFurther, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has filed civil charges against Terraform Labs and Kwon.\nNow, with the Montenegro Supreme Court’s order, the possibility of extraditing Kwon to the US has again been revived.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.",
