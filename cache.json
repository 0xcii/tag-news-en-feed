However, as the meme coin continues to trend low, even with the current bull sentiment, there is always the possibility of Musk resuming his very public support for Dogecoin.\n \nCan Elon Musk Recreate 2021 For Dogecoin?\n \nElon Musk’s influence on the Dogecoin community and the price of the meme coin by extension is still very prominent. Just the fact that Musk had purchased Twitter had sent the price of DOGE rallying over 150% in a matter of days. But so far, there has not been much from the billionaire about the cryptocurrency.\n \n \nHowever, looking back to early 2021 when Musk had been posting religiously about Dogeco…",

In Dec. 2022, the annual inflation rate dropped to 6.5%, and many experts predict it will decrease further.

Following comments last week from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, many have bought the token in anticipation of the lawsuit ending in the coming months. Dogecoin was another notable gainer on Monday.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was one of Monday’s notable gainers, as the token rose to a three-month high in today’s session.\n \nXRP/USD hit an intraday high of $0.431 to start the week, coming off the back of Sunday’s low at $0.3979.\n \nAs a result of today’s surge in price, XRP has risen to its strongest point since November 8.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the move took place following a breakout of a ceiling at the $0.410 resistance level.\n \nAs of writing, XRP is still trading above this point, however earlier gains have eased, with price now at $0.420.\n \nMomentum has eased, with traders seemingly securing gains as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is tracking at 68.64, nears a ceiling at 69.00.\n \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nIn addition to XRP, dogecoin (DOGE) started the week stronger, with the meme coin hovering close to a key resistance level.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.0861 on Sunday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.09289 earlier today.\n \nThis surge saw dogecoin briefly break out of a resistance point at $0.09200, closing in on a six-week high in the process.\n \n \nAs can be seen on the chart, this breakout was not sustained, with the meme coin now trading below $0.09000.\n \nOne of the reasons behind the afternoon’s decline is the fact that price strength has encountered a hurdle of its own.\n \nCurrently the RSI is tracking at 63.51, which is slightly below a ceiling at the 64.00 mark, and seems to have panicked earlier bulls.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect dogecoin to move beyond this resistance level this week?
