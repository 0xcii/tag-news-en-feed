It has proven versatile and stable across upheavals and social changes. It even became a vital tool in global trade and currency exchange as we know it today.\nIn the 19th century, gold was the backbone of the global monetary system. Nations relied on the gold standard until the Great Depression and World War I. These events were significant inflationary catalysts, and economies, in a decades-long transition, abandoned the gold standard. \nThis process culminated in 1971 when the Federal Exchange could no longer exchange US dollars for gold.

They serve as a timestamp and help establish the order in which satoshis occur. Ordinal theory enables participants to verify the chronology of satoshis, ensuring that the network reaches a consensus on the state of the blockchain.\nWhen a Bitcoin transaction takes place, it is recorded on the blockchain, which is essentially a decentralized ledger. Each satoshi is assigned a unique ordinal number, which acts as a digital fingerprint. This ordinal number is generated using complex cryptographic algorithms, making it virtually impossible to tamper with or forge.\nBy using ordinal numbering, Bitcoin ensures that all participants can a…",

However, upon request, clients may explore investments in other cryptocurrencies. According to SEBA's website, the crypto bank provides cold storage for a range of digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, and others.\nLooking ahead, the move enables SGKB clients to manage their cryptocurrencies alongside existing investments, a development that could become increasingly common in the years ahead.\nWith SGKB, the fifth largest cantonal bank, joining the Bitcoin fray, the path to mainstream adoption becomes increasingly clear.",
