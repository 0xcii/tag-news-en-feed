          "description": "Meme coins moved lower on Jan. 19, as cryptocurrency markets plunged following recent highs. Shiba inu, which rose to a nine-week high on Wednesday, fell by nearly 10% today. Markets have been largely overbought in the past few days, with bears seemingly reentering. Dogecoin was also in the red today.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB), which was one of Wednesday’s biggest gainers, climbing by as much as 17%, fell by over 10% today.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.00001295 in yesterday’s session, SHIB/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.00001097 earlier today.\n \nThursday’s drop came as the meme coin was unable to cross a long-term resistance level at $0.00001300.\n \n \nDespite the relatively large drop in price, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is still deeply overbought.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at a level of 80.22, which is close to a ceiling at the 82.00 mark.\n \nSHIB has somewhat rebounded from earlier declines, and is currently trading at $0.00001114.\n \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nLike Shiba inu, Dogecoin (DOGE) also declined on Thursday, with prices falling for a fifth straight day.\n \nSince rising to a one-month high on Saturday, the meme coin has moved lower in consecutive sessions.\n \nToday’s low saw DOGE/USD slip to a bottom of $0.08013, which is nearly 8% lower than Wednesday’s peak.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the drop saw DOGE near a key support point at $0.08000, with bulls so far resisting a breakout.\n \nRecent decline has pushed price strength significantly lower, moving from a reading above 70.00 on Saturday, to 52.35 as of writing.\n \nThe 50.00 mark on the RSI indicator seems to be a sustainable support point, however, should this fail to hold, DOGE bears will likely intensify downward pressure.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill we see meme coins rebound as we head towards the end of the week?

          "description": "The mining firm will nearly double its existing infrastructure, adding up to 50 Megawatts to the 36 Megawatts already in use.\nBitcoin mining firm CleanSpark has announced the start of construction on a site in Washington, Georgia, set to house 16,000 miners, which could bring the company’s hash rate total to as high as 8.7 EH/s.\nThe site, which CleanSpark announced the acquisition of in 2022, would contribute to an additional 2.2 EH/s of hash rate for the company. The expansion is estimated to cost nearly $16 million according to the press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.\n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \n“The mining machine fleet at the new phase will consist of Antminer S19j Pro and Antminer S19 XP models, the newest and most power-efficient models of bitcoin mining machines available today,” states the release. \n“When we purchased the Washington site in August, we were confident about our ability to quickly expand, adding this 50MW to the existing 36MW of infrastructure,” Zach Bradford, CleanSpark’s CEO commented. “This second phase more than doubles the size of the existing operation. We are looking forward to expanding our relationship with the Washington City community and to be able to support the construction jobs that will come with this expansion.”\n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \nScott Garrison, vice president of business development at the firm, highlighted how the site “uses mainly low-carbon sources of power, employs newest generation tech, and is among the most power-efficient and sustainable bitcoin mining operations.” \nDespite the recent wider downturn in the mining industry, CleanSpark has seen a remarkable expansion from just 2.1 EH/s in January 2022, to 6.2 EH/s in December 2022. This expansion, alongside another site buildout in Sandersville, Georgia, is set to continue that rapid growth in the coming year.",
