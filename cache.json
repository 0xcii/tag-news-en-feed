The custodial arm of the exchange plans to apply for a permit in order to start providing crypto services in Singapore.\n \nAlthough Singapore has been fairly well disposed toward crypto in the past, the country had posed certain challenges for the exchange. Just a year ago, in February, the crypto exchange shuttered operations in Singapore.\n \n \nBinance Asia Services, which happens to be the Singapore affiliate of Binance, had to suspend operations after withdrawing its local license application in December 2021. The reason stated by the crypto exchange was nothing more than “strategic, commercial, and developmental” issues.\n \nHowever, the custodial arm of the crypto excha…",
