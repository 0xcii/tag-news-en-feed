More Farms will be added soon.\n \n“Yield farming for VERSE tokens helps grow liquidity on the Verse DEX, which improves the trading experience on this important piece of decentralized infrastructure,” said Bitcoin.com CEO Dennis Jarvis. “This is a critical early step towards providing VERSE with broad utility in the Bitcoin.com ecosystem.”\n \nVERSE, which launched in December 2022, is Bitcoin.com’s rewards and utility token. VERSE is fueling the growth and expansion of Bitcoin.com’s ecosystem, which includes over 37 million self-custody wallets created in its multi-chain DeFi-ready mobile app, the Bitcoin.com Wallet. The ecosystem also includes the award-winning Bitcoin.com News portal with over 2.5 million monthly readers.\n \nThe VERSE token’s utility will include unlocking rewards along tiers, method of payment in the Bitcoin.com ecosystem and beyond, access to exclusive platform services, and more. Ultimately VERSE will help expand access to decentralized finance, enabling more people to benefit from the economic freedom and democratized finance it unlocks.\n \nVisit https://verse.bitcoin.com/farms to deposit LP tokens and start earning 80% APY.\n \nVERSE tokens are utility tokens designed for use on Bitcoin.com.
