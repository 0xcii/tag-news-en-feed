          "description": "Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

Cardano also fell to a two-week low.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was deep in the red on Friday, as prices fell for a third consecutive session.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.4838 on Thursday, XRP/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.4644 earlier today.\n \nAs a result of this drop, XRP fell to its lowest point since March 27, when the token was at a bottom at $0.4428.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, this recent shift in momentum coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) breaking out of a floor at 57.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 42.24, which is close to a support point at 41.00.\n \nShould price strength reach this point, then there is a good chance that XRP will hit a price floor at $0.4440.\n \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) also fell to a multi-week low in today’s session, as prices moved closer to a key price floor.\n \nADA/USD dropped to a low of $0.3974 on Friday, less than 24 hours after trading at a peak of $0.4087.\n \nThis is the lowest level that cardano has hit since April 12, and comes following a three-day losing streak.\n \n \nSimilar to XRP, ADA’s decline came after the RSI moved below a floor at 52.00. It is currently at a reading of 49.18.\n \nThe next visible point of support appears to be at 45.00, and should sellers claim this zone, cardano will likely move to $0.3750.\n \nThis level is a long-term price floor, and was last hit on April 6.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect further declines in cardano during the weekend?
