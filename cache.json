Gox has been dormant since it collapsed a decade  \nago, but recent on-chain fund movements indicate that creditor repayments could  \nbe approaching. The first test transactions to Bitstamp cold wallets were  \nreportedly flagged by blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence on July  \n22. \nAmid the anticipation, crypto investors are  \nspeculating about the potential downward pressure on Bitcoin's price. This step  \nmarks a significant milestone for the 127,000 creditors owed more than $9.4  \nbillion worth of Bitcoin.\nAs of July 17, more than 36% of the Bitcoin owed to  \ncreditors had already been distributed. The address associated with Mt. Gox  \ncurrently holds over 90,300 Bitcoin, valued at $6.12 billion. While the exact  \ntiming of the repayments remains unclear, the recent test transactions on  \nBitstamp suggest that the final preparations are underway.\nExpect ongoing updates as this story evolves. \n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.",

The ETF will invest in short positions on Bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This gives traders exposure to the daily inverse performance of the underlying Bitcoin futures index.\nTraders can hedge risk or speculate on downward price moves by going short on Bitcoin futures. This new tool provides an alternative to shorting or buying put options on Bitcoin directly.\nThe inverse ETF is managed by CSOP Asset Management, with HSBC as the trustee. It charges a 1.99% annual fee and aims to attract $50-100 million in assets under management in 1-2 years.\nThe launch has generated buzz as a new way to trade Bitcoin volatility. While controversial to some, inverse Bitcoin ETFs are gaining traction globally. The ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI) in the U.S. has over $70 million under management.\nThe CSOP product will be the first of its kind in Asia, bringing inverse Bitcoin exposure to Hong Kong's $5.4 trillion stock market.
