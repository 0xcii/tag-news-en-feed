The move comes as  \nboth the U.S. and South Korea seek jurisdiction over Kwon to address criminal  \ncharges related to the collapse of Terraform Labs, a multibillion-dollar crypto  \nenterprise, in May 2022.\nOngoing appeals\nThe extradition underscores the severity of the  \ncharges, as Han faces criminal proceedings in South Korea for various financial  \noffenses. Meanwhile, Kwon's appeal regarding his extradition fate remains in  \nthe hands of Montenegro's appeals court, adding complexity to the legal matter.\nHan Chang-joon and Terra co-founder Do Kwon faced  \narrest in March 2023 while attempting to travel with falsified documents.  \nSubsequently, a Montenegro court sentenced them to four months in prison,  \nsparking a contentious legal battle over their extradition.\nThe statement from the authorities, translated from  \nSerbian, stated: \"This person was deprived of his liberty in Montenegro on  \nMarch 23, 2023, at Podgorica Airport, according to an international warrant  \nissued for him by Interpol Seoul together with D.H.K., and after serving a  \nfour-month prison sentence in Montenegro for of the committed criminal offense  \nof document forgery, extradited from Montenegro.\"\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.",
