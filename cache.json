          "description": "According to the Montenegro-based newspaper Vijesti, Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terraform Labs, also known as Kwon Do-hyung, is appealing the detention extension ordered by a Montenegrin court. Kwon was arrested on March 23, 2023, after being caught at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro while traveling with fraudulent identification documents.\n \nReport Says Kwon’s Legal Representation Aims to Appeal 30-Day Detention Extension\n \nThree days ago, Montenegro’s Interior Minister Filip Adzic announced on Twitter that Do Kwon, the co-founder and CEO of Terraform Labs, was arrested on Thursday for presenting forged identity documents. Kwon’s location was unknown for some time, with speculation that he was hiding in Singapore or possibly Dubai.\n \nThe Montenegrin police stated that Kwon’s fraudulent documents originated from Costa Rica and Belgium. According to the Montenegrin newspaper Vijesti and local media, Kwon’s legal team is seeking to appeal his 30-day detention extension. Kwon is facing several legal challenges abroad, including an investigation in South Korea and multiple lawsuits in the United States.\n \n \nThe report notes that detention for Kwon’s offense is typically limited to 72 hours, but the court granted the extension due to Kwon’s status as a flight risk. Montenegrin prosecutors have stated that Kwon and his companion’s identities have not been completely verified and that foreign prosecutors, such as those from South Korea, are seeking Kwon’s extradition. Two days ago, a South Korean spokesperson announced that their prosecutors are taking measures to “repatriate Kwon Do-hyung.” Kwon’s legal team and Vijesti reporters say that the appeal will be filed this week.\n \nWhat do you think will be the outcome of Do Kwon’s legal battles in Montenegro, South Korea, and the United States?

          "description": "The famous author of the best-selling book Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has warned that the Federal Reserve’s continued rate hikes will crash stocks, bonds, real estate, as well as the U.S. dollar. He expects the next crash to be the “$1 quadrillion derivatives market.”\n \nRobert Kiyosaki on Interest Rate Hikes, Market Crashes\n \nThe author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, reiterated his warnings of market crashes and the danger of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates this week. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.\n \nKiyosaki tweeted Thursday:\n \n\nRaising interest rates will crash stocks, bonds, real estate, & $ U.S. dollar. Next crash: $1 quadrillion derivatives market. $1 quadrillion is $1 thousand trillion.\n \nThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) on Wednesday. While a number of people expect the Fed to start cutting rates soon, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that rate cuts are not in the Fed’s base case.\n \n \nThis was not the first time Kiyosaki has warned about stocks, bonds, real estate, and the U.S. dollar crashing. Last week, the famous author discussed a “crash landing ahead” as bank bailouts began following the collapse of major banks, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. He also predicted the end of the U.S. dollar, calling the USD “fake money.”\n \nThe renowned author also recently predicted that the world economy is on the verge of collapse, expecting bank runs, frozen savings, and bail-ins. In February, he said that everything will crash. Earlier this year, he said we are in a global recession, warning of soaring bankruptcies, unemployment, and homelessness.\n \nWhat do you think about Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki’s crash warnings?
