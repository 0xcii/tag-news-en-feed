Bulls have so far rejected this move towards $22,500 and instead pushed prices higher. Ethereum also rallied, with prices continuing to trade above $1,600.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) rebounded from Monday’s lows in today’s session, with prices racing back above the $23,000 level.\n \nFollowing a low of $22,692.03 to start the week, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $23,119.28 earlier in the day.\n \nThe move comes as bitcoin bulls rejected a move towards a long-term support point at $22,500, and instead bought the dip.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, today’s rebound sees BTC snap a five-day losing streak, which came following a six-month high last Thursday.\n \nTuesday’s reversal also coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bouncing from a floor of its own at 60.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 62.04, and seems to be on course to collide with a ceiling at 68.00.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nSince rejecting a move below $1,600 on Monday, ethereum (ETH) has continued to find stability, with prices edging higher today.\n \nETH/USD moved to a peak of $1,653.72 to start the day, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a bottom at $1,611.32.\n \nAs a result of this surge, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency looks to be heading towards a ceiling at $1,670.\n \n \nOne of the reasons behind this jump has also been the RSI, which failed to move below a floor at 58.00, and is now at a reading of 60.16.\n \nIn addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average continues to be upward facing, which traders see as a bullish signal.\n \nIf this momentum persists, there is a strong possibility that ethereum could be trading close to $1,700 in upcoming days.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \n Have markets calmed down from Friday’s non-farm payrolls report?
