          "description": "On January 25, market data provider Kaiko revealed that the 60-day correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and the Nasdaq 100 has averaged close to zero since June 2023. This suggests that the two asset classes have become less correlated in recent months, potentially showing that their prices are increasingly decoupling.\n \n\n \nBitcoin Decoupling with Nasdaq 100?\n \nHistorically, Bitcoin has been highly correlated with traditional asset classes, particularly the Nasdaq 100, due to its association with risk-on sentiment and speculative trading.
