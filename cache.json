The ONE Bitcoin ETF Fund is scheduled to be distributed between May 31 and June 6\nUnder the Thai SEC's rules, the ETF will be limited to wealthy and institutional investors. This follows the regulator amending local guidelines in April to permit restricted Bitcoin ETFs targeting professional investors.\nONEAM will invest the fund in 11 major global Bitcoin funds to ensure adequate liquidity and security. The company said the ETF provides exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated framework, addressing risks like theft that come with direct ownership.\nWhile ONEAM obtained approval, fellow Thai firm MFC Asset Management still awaits regulatory clearance for its own planned Bitcoin ETF product. Both will be private offerings for qualified investors only.\nThailand follows the trail blazed by the US SEC, which approved several Bitcoin ETFs this January, sparking surging interest. Other jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong, Australia, and the UK, have since followed suit in issuing spot Bitcoin ETFs or similar products.\nThe launches provide easy, regulated exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without the need to handle Bitcoin directly. This better accommodates professional investors and institutions\nBy approving a Bitcoin ETF, Thailand's regulators acknowledge the growing demand from local institutions to add Bitcoin allocations. The move could enable broader mainstream adoption once public offerings become available.",
