          "description": "Mi Primer Bitcoin’s new diploma program is set to expand opportunities for learning about Bitcoin in high schools that adopt it.\nMi Primer Bitcoin, a Bitcoin education program based in El Salvador, has announced a new and improved diploma program in English. \nAccording to Dalia Platt, head of curriculum for Mi Primer Bitcoin, the “aim is to change the way people learn about Bitcoin. The goal is to make the course interactive, fun, creative, accessible and easy to understand for all, using examples that can reach and impact every corner of the world.”\nThe student workbook shared with Bitcoin Magazine shows topics ranging from “What is Money?” to “Navigating Scarcity in a Growing Economy,” and more. \n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \nAccording to Platt, the organization has seen exponential growth. “We have educated more than 10,000 students this year, which is 25 times more than last year,” she said. “As the first Bitcoin nation, El Salvador has the unique opportunity to lead the way in Bitcoin education.”\nThe program, first covered by Bitcoin Magazine in June 2022, launched with more than 35 high school students receiving their Bitcoin diplomas. Since then, the educational mission of Mi Primer Bitcoin has not changed. Platt describes how she “Believes that our new Diploma Program has already played a significant role in achieving [leading Bitcoin education] and we are continually enhancing the course by incorporating the feedback we receive from current and past students as well as from the teachers.”\nBitcoin education is an essential part of adoption throughout the world. Without proper knowledge both in relation to the current workings of the monetary systems of the world, and the new protocol that Bitcoin offers, one cannot properly make the decision to adopt Bitcoin. Only after learning about money as it is, and money as it could be, is the full potential of Bitcoin unveiled. Programs like Mi Primer Bitcoin offer this education and learning in order to unlock that potential.",

On Tuesday, Singh pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stated, “I am unbelievably sorry for my role in all of this.”\n \nSingh Cooperating With Authorities in FTX Investigation; Bankman-Fried Declines to Comment on Singh’s Guilty Plea\n \nFormer FTX director of engineering Nishad Singh pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, money laundering, and violating campaign finance laws in the United States, according to reports.\n \n“I am unbelievably sorry for my role in all of this,” Singh said in a New York court on Tuesday. During the hearing, Singh’s prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, explained that Singh flew back from the Bahamas to assist with the U.S. investigation after FTX collapsed.\n \nSingh stated that he knew around mid-2022 that Alameda Research was using customer funds, and he also pledged to forfeit the proceeds he obtained from the scheme. Reuters first reported the news, and following Singh’s plea, the publication contacted Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) for comment.\n \n \nAccording to the report, a spokesman for Bankman-Fried declined to comment. Singh’s plea comes after ex-Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang pleaded guilty. Ellison provided a detailed account that also acknowledged the use of customer funds in the FTX/Alameda scheme. Bankman-Fried faces 12 charges, including bank fraud, after four new charges were added to his initial indictment.\n \nWhat do you think this guilty plea means for the ongoing investigation into FTX and Alameda Research?
