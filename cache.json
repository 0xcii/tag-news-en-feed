The increase occurred at block height 774,144, at 6:10 a.m. (UTC). The difficulty is now at 39.35 trillion, close to surpassing 40 trillion. The next adjustment is due Feb. 11, 2023.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe rise makes mining blocks more difficult, following a 4.68% jump after the 10.26% increase on Jan. 15, 2023. Jan. 29 statistics show a hashrate of 279.7 exahash per second (EH/s) over the last 2,016 blocks, currently at 283.55 EH/s dedicated to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nStatistics from macromicro.me on Jan. 28, 2023, estimate the cost of BTC production at $21,176 per unit.

With spot prices higher than the cost of production, bitcoin (BTC) miners have recouped some losses from the end of 2022.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPool distribution calculated by blocks discovered shows Foundry USA as the top mining pool with 101.47 EH/s, equating to 34.89% of the network’s hashpower.
