          "description": "The Bank of Korea governor Rhee Chang-yong recently stated that the growing stablecoin use threatens the operations of central banks. The possible involvement of global networks like Visa and Mastercard in the stablecoin business will likely undermine the monetary independence of countries like South Korea. \n \nCentral Banks Urged to Prepare for Digitization\n \nThe growing use of stablecoins like USDT and USDC is posing a new threat to the operations of central banks and may be making monetary policies less effective, according to Rhee Chang-yong, the governor of the Bank of Korea. Speaking at a recent digital money conference, Chang-yong urged central banks to prepare for digitization if they wish to keep abreast with the fast-changing financial landscape.\n \nA Yonhap report states that the BOK governor believes global networks such as Visa and Mastercard’s likely involvement with stablecoins will undermine countries like South Korea’s monetary independence. Therefore, to stop stablecoins from wreaking havoc on his country’s capital inflows, Chang-yong proposed launching central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n \n“This underscores the urgency for central banks to consider introducing central bank digital currencies (CBDC), whether retail or wholesale,” the BOK governor reportedly said.\n \n \nWhile he conceded that retail CBDCs may have no clear advantage over regular payment methods, Chang-yong insisted that their programmability feature allows such digital currencies to bring with them “a realm of possibilities.” One such possibility is the execution of complex and conditional transactions automatically via smart contracts.\n \nMeanwhile, the BOK also revealed that South Korea, which has already launched a pilot project for a retail CBDC system, is working on a wholesale pilot project. The South Korean Central Bank’s partners for the project include the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and financial regulators.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",

The institution opened a public consultation seeking input from market participants and individuals to prepare the rules VASPs would have to follow, according to the faculties it received since the approval and sanction of the cryptocurrency assets law in December 2023.\nThe bank introduced a 38-item questionnaire that can be answered totally or partially, indicating the numbers and themes respondents want to address in their statements.\nEach question is part of a broader subject of the public consultation, including areas such as asset segregation and risk management, activities developed and virtual assets traded, hiring essential services, governance and conduct rules, cyber ​​security, providing information and protecting customers, transition rules, and general manifestations.\nThe issue of asset segregation has significance, given that it was initially proposed to be part of the final text of the approved cryptocurrency assets law, but was finally left out due to the limitations it would impose on the operations that VASPs could conduct. Tax exemptions for mining projects leveraging renewable energy were also left out of the final text and might be affected by these rules.\nThe public consultation process will be open until January 31, 2024, and all answers will be publicly available for review on the bank’s page.\nWhat do you think about the public consultation of the Central Bank of Brazil to regulate the operation of VASPs?
