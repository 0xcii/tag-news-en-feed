          "description": "According to insiders who reached out to Bloomberg, there are intriguing developments surrounding Ryan Salame, the former co-chief executive of FTX Digital Markets. The buzz is that he is gearing up to admit guilt in response to criminal charges. This marks a significant shift from his earlier stance, which was revealed in mid-August when he appeared poised to invoke the Fifth Amendment, thereby rendering himself unavailable as a potential witness.\n \nRyan Salame’s Dramatic Turn: From Invoking the Fifth to Pondering Guilty Plea\n \nThe current narrative presents a contrasting perspective, hinting at the potential formation of a plea agreement concerning Ryan Salame, the former co-chief of FTX. Citing “people familiar with the case,” Bloomberg reports that Salame is poised to enter a guilty plea in connection with the FTX collapse.\n \nBloomberg’s Ava Benny-Morrison delivered this report on September 7, 2023, diverging from the accounts of the previous month. During that period, court documents from the prosecution’s case against ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) had indicated that Salame had expressed his intention to invoke the Fifth Amendment if subpoenaed, rendering him “unavailable as a witness.”\n \n \nShould Salame indeed plead guilty, he will become the fourth individual to do so, joining Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh. SBF, on the other hand, has pleaded not guilty to all the criminal charges against him and is presently incarcerated, awaiting trial at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The trial is scheduled for October, and SBF’s legal team is actively seeking his release from custody to prepare for the upcoming proceedings.\n \nWhat do you think about the insiders who say Salame plans to enter a guilty plea?

          "description": "The Bitcoin block rewards are becoming lesser and lesser with each halving. Will transaction fees eventually be able to fill up this void?\n \nBitcoin Transaction Fees Has Been Trending Up With Each Cycle\n \nOne of the most innovative features of the Bitcoin blockchain is that approximately every four years, the block subsidy (that miners receive for solving blocks on the network) is slashed in half. Such events are called the “halving.”\n \nHalvings naturally mean that the miners’ revenues also take a heavy hit, primarily made up of the block rewards. Why does the concept of halving even exist? Well, consider the scenario if there was no halving.\n \nThe block rewards serve as the only way to mint new tokens so that they can be equated to the new production of the asset. Without halvings, miners…",

After the collapses of FTX, BlockFi, Celsius and many others, the merit of the “not your keys” mantra is beyond obvious. However, self-custody comes in many forms, and the security properties of a single-seed setup are not that great. That is why advanced bitcoiners should consider upgrading to a Shamir backup.\nWhat is Shamir backup?\nShamir backup is a method for securely splitting a recovery seed while adding an element of redundancy. For example, with Shamir backup it is possible to have a 3-of-5 recovery seed, where the user writes down 5 lists of recovery words, and later needs only 3 of those lists to recover the wallet. Compared to a setup based on a single …",
