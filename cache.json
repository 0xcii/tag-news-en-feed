It would also require that miners purchase their electricity from the energy provider Korem at market rates. \nPreviously, specific reporting and tax requirements were implemented, including registration of names, locations and quarterly reports to the government. These occurred as a result of the major influx of mining amidst energy shortages and protests, all while bitcoin miners fled China as a response to the government’s banning of bitcoin.\nKazakhstan’s close proximity to China and previously highly favorable energy access led to the large amounts of hash rate migrating to the country. Afterwards, Kazakhstan went as far as seizing up to $200 million in mining equipment who did not comply with regulation, and the country continues to try and absorb the benefits of the influx in bitcoin mining using legislation like this most recently approved bill. \nBitcoin Magazine previously reported on regulation in Kazakhstan, citing a report from the Russian media outlet Tass. In the report, Ekaterina Smyshlyaeva, a member of the Committee on Economic Reform and Regional Development of the Majilis (Kazakhstan’s federal parliamentary body) detailed the government’s intentions, describing how, \"Kazakhstan was used as a raw material appendage of the blockchain industry. [Through] bills, we oblige miners to license in Kazakhstan, that is, to create legal entities and become full-fledged subjects of taxation.”",

          "description": "Dogecoin fell to a ten-day low on Dec. 7, as the meme coin extended a recent decline, falling for a third consecutive session. Overall, cryptocurrency markets have been mostly bearish in today’s session, and are down 1.07% as of writing. Chainlink was another notable token to fall, and is currently trading by as much as 5% lower.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) dropped to a ten-day low on Wednesday, with prices falling for a third straight session.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.101 on Tuesday, DOGE/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.09519 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of this, the meme coin fell to its lowest point since November 28, when prices hit a bottom of $0.0907.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it appears that DOGE bears are hoping to recapture this level, which is also a key support point.\n \nThis move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) was unable to stay above its own floor, at the 54.00 mark.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 52.07, with its next visible point of support at the 49.25 level.\n \n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nIn addition to dogecoin, another notable token to fall in today’s session has been chainlink (LINK).\n \nLINK/USD slipped to a bottom of $6.80 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a peak of $7.29.\n \nLike with DOGE, today’s decline has pushed the world’s 20th-largest token to its lowest point since November 28.\n \n \nOn that occasion, prices hit a low of $6.53, which was marginally above a floor at the $6.50 point.\n \nAs of writing, it appears that traders are looking to take LINK back towards this level. This comes as the RSI nears a floor of its own.\n \nThe index is tracking at 46.89, which is close to the point of support at 45.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill chainlink fall below $6.50 this week?
