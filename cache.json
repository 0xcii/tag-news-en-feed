          "description": "A joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC. has brought the first nuclear-powered Bitcoin mine online in Pennsylvania.\nTerawulf has announced roughly half of its nuclear-powered Nautilus Cryptomine has come online. The mining facility, a joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC., derives its energy wholly from the 2.5 GW Susquehanna nuclear generation station in Pennsylvania.\nThe full operation will amount to 50 MW and 1.9 EH/s, with an option for Terawulf to add an additional 50 MW of bitcoin mining capacity, “which the Company plans to deploy in future phases,” according to a press release. \nPaul Prager, chairman and CEO of TeraWulf, said that “the recent energization of the Nautilus facility earlier this month, approximately 16,000 of TeraWulf’s owned miners, representing 1.9 EH/s of self-mining capacity, are onsite and being brought online daily.” \n“The Nautilus nuclear-powered mining facility benefits from what is arguably the lowest cost power in the sector, just $0.02/kWh for a term of five years,” Prager commented.\nMining consultant and cofounder of Citadel 256, Magdalena Gronowska, previously described in an article for Bitcoin Magazine how nuclear power can revolutionize Bitcoin mining.\n“Nuclear is a carbon free, reliable and cheap energy source,” she told the magazine. “It's not perfect in that it emits nuclear waste, but every energy source has tradeoffs between environmental footprint, reliability and capital and operating costs… We need a diverse mix of energy generation, to serve both baseload and peak load, as we transition to a low carbon economy.”",

Interestingly, some of the world’s top bitcoin mining pools are also using their hashrate to merge-mine other coins, and these networks have benefited from bitcoin’s increased hashrate.\n \nHow Bitcoin’s Hashrate Benefits Other Crypto Networks\n \nBitcoin’s hashrate secures the network and provides rewards for miners participating in the system, but mining pools also dedicate computational power to networks like Namecoin, Elastos, Emercoin, and Vcash. For example, Namecoin has a hashrate of around 187 EH/s today, and some of the top bitcoin mining pools merge-mine the network to acquire namecoin (NMC) rewards.\n \nM…",
