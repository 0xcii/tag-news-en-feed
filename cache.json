          "description": "Tether, the company behind the world’s most popular stablecoin USDT, acquired 1,529 bitcoin in the second quarter of 2023.\nPaolo Ardoino, the company’s CTO, confirmed the purchase to Bitcoin Magazine. According to the executive, Tether paid roughly $45.4 million to add the BTC to its balance sheet.\nThe purchase confirms the company is following the plans it delineated earlier this year. Tether announced in May that it would start allocating up to 15% of quarterly profits to bitcoin, a move that could challenge popular bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, executive chairman of software intelligence firm MicroStrategy.\nNasdaq-listed MicroStrategy this week announced it acquired 467 BTC in July. Bitcoin has been hovering around the $30,000 mark for a couple months, and the stability seems to have prompted Saylor to pull the trigger and add $14.4 million worth of BTC to the company’s treasury. MicroStrategy currently holds 152,800 BTC, while Tether owns over 54,000 BTC with the Q2 buy.\nBitcoin’s nearly 76% jump year-to-date is renewing institutional interest in the digital currency, with the world’s largest asset manager filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in June. Many asset managers fast-followed $8.6 trillion BlackRock to re-file their previously denied applications. \nWhile the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has denied plenty of similar filings in the past, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts yesterday coined a 65% chance that BlackRock’s filing receives the regulatory green light. Notably, BlackRock’s ETF applications have been denied only once, out of roughly 550 filings.\nThe eventual approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is broadly seen as bullish by the market, and companies such as Tether and MicroStrategy would be set to benefit the most from the assumed price appreciation of the coin. Coincidently, the deadline for the SEC to issue a decision on most of these ETF applications aligns closely with the Bitcoin halving – another event widely perceived as positive for the future of bitcoin’s price.",

          "description": "Bitcoin was once again trading below the $29,000 level on Thursday, as bulls retreated following yesterday’s gains. The drop appeared to come as traders secured profits, following a failed breakout of a key price point. Ethereum also edged lower today. \n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $29,000 zone in today’s session, as bulls appeared to have abandoned their positions following Wednesday’s gains.\n \nAfter peaking at $29,988.00 yesterday, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $28,946.51 earlier in the day.\n \nThis comes as the bullish sentiment surrounding Microstrategy’s latest BTC investment seems to have already faded.\n \n \nIn addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) failed to move past a key ceiling at 50.00, and has bounded off a floor at 42.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 42.79, with BTC climbing back above the $29,000 mark as a result.\n \nPrice may now consolidate, as traders’ attention turns to Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nAdditionally, ethereum (ETH) also moved lower earlier in the day, dropping below a support point of $1,850 in the process.\n \nETH/USD bottomed out at $1,822.35 during today’s session, following Wednesday’s high at $1,860.19.\n \nAs a result of today’s decline, ethereum moved back towards a four-week low at $1,812.\n \n \nThe slippage took place after the RSI fell below a floor at the 45.00 level, and it is now at a reading of 41.93.\n \nShould momentum continue to drop, the next price target will likely be the $1,795 level.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill markets rebound prior to tomorrow’s payrolls report?
