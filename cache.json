          "description": "Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the partnership aims to help accelerate Bhutan's digital transformation and economic diversification, while expanding Bitdeer's global footprint. The two firms will establish a closed-end fund worth up to $500 million, which will launch in May 2023. Bitdeer will serve as the general partner, while DHI will act as a strategic limited partner.\n“The Partnership is expected to create local jobs in areas ranging from engineering to project management, supervisory and supportive functions,” the press release said. “At the same time, the Partnership is expected to generate economic activity and foreign-currency-denominated revenue for local communities and the country.”\nBitdeer's Chairman, Jihan Wu, said, \"We are excited to be working alongside DHI in accessing Bhutan's zero-emissions power to sustainably enable the blockchain technologies that will eventually form an immutable bedrock for a global store of value.\" \n“We are thrilled to partner with Bitdeer on this important development for DHI.” Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of Druk Holding and Investments, commented. \"DHI exists for the betterment of the lives of Bhutanese people today and for generations to follow.\"\nBitdeer currently operates data centers in Northern Europe and North America. As the press release notes, the upcoming carbon-free bitcoin mining operation in Bhutan will mark a crucial expansion into Asia for Bitdeer, which “will enable Bitdeer to tap into Asia's abundant resources, contributing to the flourishing regional ecosystem.”",
