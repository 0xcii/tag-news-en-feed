          "description": "Bitcoin miners faced another uphill battle this month, marking the second straight increase in mining difficulty. On August 22, at block height 804,384, the difficulty surged by 6.17%. This fresh peak in Bitcoin’s difficulty sets a new record, intensifying the challenge for miners in securing block rewards. \n \nBitcoin Difficulty Jumps More Than 6% Higher\n \nOn August 22, 2023, Bitcoin’s network difficulty surged by 6.17%, setting a record at 55.62 trillion. This spike signals that miners will have to exert significantly more computational muscle to discover blocks. So far in August, there have been two notable shifts: a modest 0.12% increase on August 9, 2023, and the substantial 6.17% climb. Coupled with the recent dip in BTC’s value, miners are grappling with heightened challenges.\n \n \nYet, the network’s hashrate remains robust, hovering just above the 400 exahash per second (EH/s) mark. An average of 403.6 EH/s was recorded across the last 2,016 blocks, and the preceding epoch’s block time averaged 9:20 minutes. Impressively, as of Wednesday, blocks are being generated even faster, in 8 minutes, 52 seconds, suggesting that miners remain undeterred by the current turbulence. The network’s next anticipated difficulty adjustment is around September 4, 2023.\n \n \nRecent data reveals that 459 blocks were produced over three days, all filled with transactions and zero empty blocks. Foundry USA leads the pack with a dominant 30.94% hashrate share, equating to 124.72 EH/s, and 142 blocks mined. Hot on the pool’s heels are Antpool and F2pool, commanding hashrate shares of 21.79% and 19.39% respectively. Average block sizes typically range between 1.6 and 1.7 million bytes among these pools. Additionally, transaction fees, as a slice of block rewards, remain consistent, floating between 1.4% and 1.91% across pools.\n \nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin network’s latest difficulty increase?

The group, which uses malicious applications to target  \ncryptocurrency companies and individuals, is also known as Trader-Traitor.\nLazarus Implicated in $40 Million Bitcoin Theft\nIn a  \nstatement released yesterday (Tuesday), the FBI noted that approximately 1,580  \nBTCs were stolen and are currently being held in six BTC addresses. The US domestic  \nintelligence and security service added that the group may attempt to cash out  \nthe stolen digital asset. \nFurthermore, the agency pointed out that hackers from the group are behind several significant crypto thefts recorded in recent  \nmonths. These include the heist of $60 million in digital assets from Alphapo,  \nthe $37 million stolen from CoinsPaid, and a $100 million theft from Atomic  \nWallet, all of which were carried out in June this year. \n“The FBI  \npreviously provided information on their attacks against Harmony’s Horizon  \nbridge and Sky Mavis’ Ronin Bridge, and provided a Cybersecurity Advisory on  \nTraderTraitor,” the FBI added.\nIn the  \nstatement, the intelligence agency also called on blockchain companies to  \nscrutinize the blockchain records of the BTC addresses. It further urged  \nprivate companies to exercise caution in order to avoid transactions that are  \ndirectly or indirectly linked to the addresses.\n“The FBI  \nwill continue to expose and combat the DPRK’s use of illicit  \nactivities—including cybercrime and virtual currency theft—to generate revenue  \nfor the regime,” the FBI added.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Solomon Oladipupo at www.financemagnates.com.",
