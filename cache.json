The move came despite the global market cap falling marginally lower as of the time of writing. Toncoin was another notable mover, rising for a sixth-straight day.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) surged higher on Tuesday, as sentiment in the token has remained largely bullish in recent days.\n \nSOL/USD peaked at $25.24 during today’s session, which follows up from a low of $24.35 to start the week.\n \nThis climb saw solana trade at its highest point since July 29, when price reached a high of $25.39.\n \n \nThe move came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nShould upward momentum continue to intensify, the next target for traders will likely be around the $26.00 mark.\n \nAt the time of writing, SOL is trading at $24.82.\n \n \nToncoin (TON)\n \nToncoin (TON) was also in the green in today’s session, as the price climbed for a sixth-consecutive session.\n \nFollowing a low of $1.42 to start the week, TON/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1.49 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of today’s surge in price, toncoin moved to its strongest level since July 23, and closer to a ceiling of $1.50.\n \n \nSimilar to solana above, the rally came as the 10-day and 25-day moving averages neared an upwards cross.\n \nOne area of concern for bulls is the current reading of the RSI indicator, which is tracking at 66.91.\n \nThis is the highest area it has reached in the coin’s history, meaning it is greatly overbought, with bears potentially waiting to take advantage of this.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould toncoin begin to move lower in the coming days?

          "description": "During the last crypto bull market, Dogecoin was a clear leader among altcoins and beat Bitcoin by miles in terms of return on investment (ROI).\n \nCould this old dog be up to it’s same tricks? The meme coin is mere pennies away from triggering a “parabolic” signal that the last time around resulted in a 25,000% gain.\n \nWhy Dogecoin Could Become A Bull-Dog\n \nDogecoin has lost a large share of its former value alongside the rest of the crypto industry. This is common during a bear market. But during a bull market, the returns have historically been shocking.\n \n \nThe meme coin became the poster child of the last crypto bull run, famously being mentioned numerous times during Elon Musk’s Saturday Night Live performance.\n \nThat event was close to the peak of the previous cycle, and since then has been rolling over and playing dead. Soon, it could bite back. That is according to the Parabolic SAR indicator on the 1M DOGEUSD chart.\n \n\n \n \nDOGE Closes In On Parabolic Buy Trigger\n \nThe Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator created by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. who also created such tools as the Relative Strength Index, the Average Directional Index, and Average True Range.\n \nThe tool is used to tell a trader or investor that the trend has “stopped and reversed”. If DOGEUSD can tag the Parabolic SAR on the 1M timeframe, it could tell the market that the trend has officially changed.\n \n \nThe reason this is important, is because Dogecoin is typically an indication that altcoin season is approaching. When it begins to take off, so does the rest of the altcoin market. At least it has always historically done so.\n \nA buy signal has only been triggered three times in the past, causing a 500%, 225%, and 25,000% rally, respectively. Will this signal once again prove as reliable as man’s best friend?\n \nThis chart originally appeared in “Issue #16: Worst Bear Market Ever” of CoinChartist VIP. Subscribe for free.",

          "description": "Bitcoin mostly consolidated on Tuesday, as traders anticipated the release of July’s retail sales data from the United States. Sales rose by 0.7%, better than the 0.4% expected, and this comes following a 0.2% increase in June. Ethereum also remained unchanged prior to the data.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) was trading in the red for the majority of the day, as price consolidated prior to the release of U.S. retail sales data.\n \nAfter peaking at $29,660.25 to start the week, BTC/USD fell to a low of $29,272.35 earlier in today’s session.\n \nSince moving above $30,000 on August 8, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has mostly trended sideways.\n \n \nOne reason for a lack of direction appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI) tracking between a support and resistance of its own.\n \nThe index is currently at a reading of 47.57, and has mostly moved between a floor at 47.00, and ceiling at 49.00 in recent days.\n \nFor bulls, a breakout above the 49.00 zone will also likely be the straw needed to break the camel’s back.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) has remained largely unchanged in the past few days, rising by 0.11% in the past week.\n \nETH/USD bottomed out at $1,837.21 so far during today’s session, which is almost $20.00 lower than Monday’s high.\n \nPrice has mostly consolidated around a support point of $1,830 in recent days, however the prospect of a moving average crossover is keeping bullish hopes alive.\n \n \nThe 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages are on the cusp of an upwards crossover, which could likely send prices above $1,900.\n \nSimilar to BTC, there will first need to be a breakout above a ceiling on the RSI indicator for this to take place.\n \nOn this occasion the resistance point is at 47.00, and the index is currently tracking at 45.23.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \n Is a bullish run on the cards in the next few weeks?
