The relevant indicator here is the “yearly absorption rates,” which measures the yearly Bitcoin balance changes of the different cohorts in the market and compares them with the number of coins issued over this period.\n \nThe “coins issued” refer to the total amount BTC miners receive as block rewards for mining a block.

NFT projects on non-Ethereum chains aspire to see levels of liquidity achieved by top Ethereum-based projects, while Ethereum-based NFT collections see the ‘bigger fish in a smaller pond’ opportunity with leaner non-Ethereum chains.

The date came earlier than expected but has been accelerated due to Genesis filing for bankruptcy and possible liquidity issues at parent company Digital Currency Group, the umbrella under which Grayscale operates.\n \n \nNevertheless, Grayscale seems ready for this as CEO Michael Sonnenshein says that the company will n…",

The move saw prices drop by over 5%, edging closer towards a key price floor in the process. Polygon also extended recent declines, hitting its weakest point since January 19.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) dropped to a five-day low on Wednesday, as the global cryptocurrency market cap fell by as much as 3% today.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.08919, DOGE/USD fell to an intraday low of $0.08245 earlier today.\n \nThe move saw dogecoin hit its lowest point since January 20, which is the last time prices were trading at a floor of $0.080.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, the decline took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a support level of its own at 55.00.\n \nIn addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has now shifted its direction, and appears to be on course for a downward trend.\n \nShould this take place, and result in a crossover with the 25-day (blue) moving average, then DOGE will likely be trading below $0.080.\n \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) was also in the red on hump day, with the token moving lower for a third consecutive day.\n \nMATIC/USD fell below the $1.00 mark in today’s session, as prices slipped to a low of $0.938 earlier in the day.\n \nSimilar to dogecoin, today’s decline has pushed polygon to its weakest point since last Thursday, when prices were trading at a floor of $0.940.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, price strength also edged lower, with the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a floor of 58.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is now tracking at 55.96, with a floor of 53.00 the next possible target for bears.\n \nBulls have so far rejected this advance, with MATIC rebounding from earlier lows, currently sitting at $0.9588, at the time of writing.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat is behind today’s bearish momentum in crypto markets?
