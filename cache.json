          "description": "After weeks of consolidation, bitcoin has started the second half of September in relatively bullish fashion. Prices have once again surged above the $27,000 level, which comes as traders attention turns to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. Prior to this, we explore how the price of bitcoin may move for the remainder of the month.\n \nCurrent Market Status\n \nThe first fortnight of September has been largely non-eventful, with bitcoin mostly consolidating below $26,500.\n \nThis comes as volatility in the market hovered close to a five-year low in August, with trading volume amongst exchanges falling by $52 billion.\n \nHowever, as we move into the fall, there has been a slight rise in volatility, mostly led by a rise in both inflation and retail sales in the United States.\n \nMarkets have used this as confirmation that the Federal Reserve will hike rates later this week, which could lead to dollar strength.\n \n\n \nSeptember Outlook\n \nBitcoin peaked at $27,414.73 earlier in today’s session, following a low of $24,900 exactly a week ago.\n \nThis has seen BTC/USD reach its highest level since August 31, 2023, and comes as the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages near an upward cross.\n \n \nFrom the chart, the potential for this move has been on the cards for a while, however, it has finally taken place as volatility returned to the market.\n \nAdditionally, the relative strength index has now also moved past a key point of resistance at 53.00, which has been a thorn in the sight of bulls for the past few weeks.\n \nThe next real ceiling lies at 65.00, and should bulls be targeting this, there is a chance bitcoin (BTC) ends the month above $28,300.\n \nWhere will bitcoin end the month?

While one camp advocated sacrificing a degree of decentralization through a block size increase, their opponents maintained that the cost to Bitcoin's core ethos was untenable.

He previously broke his silence most recently with a lengthy podcast in which he aired his concerns about Paul Storzc's drivechains upgrade proposal.\nThe Ordinals Summit, a gathering of NFT enthusiasts, was a notable celebration of the protocol at a time when its use has seemingly declined. The software, which allows digital artifacts to be traded like NFTs on the Bitcoin network, had previously garnered significant attention and praise from collectors and earned criticism for breaking crypto's rigid cultural lines.\nThe growing popularity of the Ordinals protocol among NFT collectors had taken Rodarmor by surprise. It gained traction rapidly, filling a niche in the market for Bitcoin enthusiasts who wished to participate in the NFT space. However, this success also drew the ire of some Bitcoin proponents who were staunchly against NFTs, though the reasons for the critiques varied from moral to technical objections.\nIn response to this polarized reaction, Rodarmor chose to step back from the limelight temporarily, focusing on refining the Ordinals protocol. Last week marked a notable change with Rodarmor merging an upgrade that helps more clearly establish provenance for the inscriptions that comprise a specific collection.\nIn his keynote address, he expressed gratitude for the support the community had shown and emphasized the need for innovation within the cryptocurrency space.\nThe Ordinals Summit was attended by a diverse range of developers and enthusiasts, all keen to explore the potential of the Ordinals protocol and its impact on the future of NFTs. Notable speakers included Udi Wertheimer, creator of the Taproot Wizards NFT project and, Domo, the pseudonymous creator of the BRC-20 protocol.",
