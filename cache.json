We are the only large-scale miner who can do this because we run our own pool and ensure that all the blocks mined by MARA Pool are made in the USA.\"\nThis initiative coincides with comments made earlier this summer by Presidential candidate Donald Trump, who expressed a desire for \"all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!!\" as Trump believes more Bitcoin mining done in the country will contribute to America’s goal of becoming energy dominant. He also reiterated his support for domestic Bitcoin mining at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville, pledging to ensure that American miners receive the electricity needed to mine more Bitcoin here in the USA.\n\nEarlier today, Marathon Digital announced a $250 million private offering of convertible notes, with the proceeds aimed at purchasing more Bitcoin, following the strategy of corporate Bitcoin accumulation pioneered by MicroStrategy.",
