Prices of the world’s largest digital currency rose above $23,000, rebounding from a recent drop towards $20,000. Ethereum also rallied, as it hit its strongest point since September.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) raced past the $23,000 level to start the weekend, with prices climbing to a multi-month high.\n \nFollowing a low of $20,961.21 on Friday, BTC/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $23,249.89 earlier today.\n \nToday’s rally saw bitcoin jump to its highest level since August 24, when price at the time was trading at a top of $23,600.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, the move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved back towards a ceiling of 90.00.\n \nCurrently, the index is at the 86.30 level, with earlier gains somewhat fading, as traders move to secure profits.\n \nAs of writing, BTC is trading at $22,902.03, which is still roughly 9.27% higher than yesterday’s low.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nLike bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also surged on Saturday, as it climbed to its highest mark in the last four months.\n \nETH/USD hit a high of $1,674.18 earlier in the day, which comes following a bottom of $1,550.03 on Friday.\n \nAs a result of the move, ethereum recaptured a high not seen since September 13, which is the last time it traded over $1,700.\n \n \nAlthough prices are currently below this threshold, the resurgence of bullish momentum on Saturday could lead to further surges this weekend.\n \nThe surge has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average back into an uptrend, extending its distance from its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nOverall, ethereum is up 6.28% as of writing.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect ethereum to rise above $1,700 this weekend?

          "description": "An Indian government official says that there is currently nothing that outlaws crypto in India “as long as you follow the legal process.” Meanwhile, the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has stressed that “cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value.”\n \nIndian Government Official on Crypto\n \nIndian government official Rajeev Chandrasekhar talked about cryptocurrency Thursday at an event in Bengaluru. Chandrasekhar currently serves as both India’s Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology and Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. He is also a member of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament.\n \nHe explained that India has no issue with cryptocurrencies if all laws are followed, Reuters reported, quoting him as saying:\n \n\nThere is nothing today that outlaws crypto as long as you follow the legal process.\n \nThe Indian government has not yet established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. In December last year, the government told parliament that crypto legislation “can be effective only with significant international collaboration.” Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said the government plans to discuss crypto regulations with the G20 countries.\n \nHowever, crypto income is already taxed at 30% in India, and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) is levied on crypto transactions. Earlier this month, the government revealed that it is launching a crypto awareness campaign.\n \nMeanwhile, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has recommended a complete ban on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week that “Cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value,” warning that “it will undermine the authority of the RBI and lead to the dollarization of the economy.” He even expects crypto to cause the next financial crisis if it is not banned.\n \nWhat do you think about the statement by Indian government official Chandrasekhar? Let us know in the comments section below.",
