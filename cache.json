Following this week’s gains, traders have seemingly started to secure gains, with the global market cap down by 0.52% as of writing this. Bitcoin has fallen below yesterday’s peak above $31,000.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) moved back below the $31,000 level on Saturday, as cryptocurrency markets consolidated to start the weekend.\n \nFollowing a high of $31,005.61 on Friday, BTC/USD dropped to a low of $30,044.50 earlier in today’s session.\n \nYesterday’s peak saw bitcoin climb to its highest level since June 7, which has seemingly prompted bulls to secure gains.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the decline in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a ceiling at 71.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 70.18, which is marginally higher than a floor at 68.00.\n \nIn the event the RSI drops below 70.00 there is a good chance that even more bulls could vacate earlier positions, in order to protect recent profits.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nAlthough relatively lower than Friday’s high, ethereum (ETH) continued above $2,100 so far in Saturday’s session.\n \nETH/USD fell to an intraday bottom at $2,049.08 earlier in the day, however, has since recovered and is currently trading at $2,103.18.\n \nThis is marginally lower than yesterday’s peak of $2,120.59, which saw ETH trade at its strongest point since last May.\n \n \nSimilar to bitcoin, ethereum, which is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, has collided with a ceiling on the RSI indicator.\n \nThe aforementioned point of resistance at 75.00 was hit on Friday, with the index now tracking at 74.88.\n \nShould ethereum bulls move beyond this point, there is a possibility that prices could head closer to $2,200 this weekend.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould ethereum fall below $2,000 this weekend?

The blockchain network company, founded by Bittorrent creator Bram Cohen, will initiate the IPO after the U.S. securities regulator approves the filing.\n \nBittorrent Creator’s Chia Aims for an IPO\n \nBram Cohen’s Chia network intends to go public and took a step in that direction on Friday, April 14, 2023, when the firm submitted a Form S-1 filing with the SEC. The blockchain and cryptocurrency project, launched in 2018, leverages storage for consensus through a mechanism called Proof of Space and Time (PoST), in contrast to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW). PoST uses hard disk space as the foundation for its consensus algorithm. Chia’s COO Gene Hoffman indicated that the company had been focused on an IPO since May 2021.\n \n \nOn April 14, Chia announced that it had confidentially submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-1 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed initial public offering of its common stock. Chia’s move follows a number of crypto tokens being declared unregistered securities by the SEC. Chia has raised a total of $71.12 million and obtained $61 million in May 2021, in a Series D financing round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Richmond Global Ventures.\n \n \nChia’s native token XCH rose 14.2% on the news, and during the past 24 hours, it has been trading at a range of $39.56 to $45.38 per coin. Over the last seven days, Chia’s XCH has risen 19.3% against the U.S. dollar. However, XCH is 97% lower than the all-time high it set on May 15, 2021, when it reached $1,645 per unit. At the time of writing, XCH has a market capitalization of around $317 million and is ranked 143rd among thousands of other crypto market cap metrics.\n \nWhat do you think about Chia’s decision to go public through an IPO?
