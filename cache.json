          "description": "With its latest filing update, asset management firm ARK Investment Management has gained an edge in the race for the first Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n \nThe firm has amended its 19b-4 application filing for spot Bitcoin ETF to include a surveillance sharing agreement with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and a crypto exchange, likely Coinbase, according to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. \n \nThe new agreement puts ARK’s filing similar to BlackRock’s recent filing. It is more likely to be approved since they filed first in collaboration with the institutional investment firm 21Shares.\n \nWho Will Win The Bitcoin ETF Race?\n \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has previously cited concerns about the lack of surveillance and regulator…",

          "description": "Introduction\nIn a blockchain network where participants remain anonymous, a dependable coordination mechanism is essential. The \"proof\" acts as confirmation that a participant has met the requirements to validate a block of transactions, signifying their good-faith participation. One such consensus algorithm employed to generate new blocks, distribute new cryptocurrency, and validate transactions is proof of stake (PoS).\nThis mechanism provides an alternative to the original consensus method, proof of work (PoW). Rather than the energy expenditure necessitated by PoW, PoS requires validators or miners to make contributions to the network from their own holdings of the blockchain's native cryptocurrency, i.e., their “stake.”\nTo avoid losing their stake, validators are incentivized to operat…",
