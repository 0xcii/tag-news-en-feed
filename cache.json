          "description": "Many commentators compare Bitcoin with gold, the idea being that its finite supply makes it an attractive long-term store of value. There have been historical examples of broad adoption of gold currencies, such as the British Empire’s sovereign and half-sovereign.

One of the world’s most heavily used silver currencies, the Spanish silver dollar, may offer a better comparison.\nThe Spanish silver dollar, or reale as it was originally known, was unusual because it prospered as a trade currency w…",
