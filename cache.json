The expansion is expected to increase CleanSpark's bitcoin mining compute power by 1.8 exahashes per second (EH/s) to a total of 8.5 EH/s. The company has set lofty goals of reaching a target of 16 EH/s by the end of the year. The Washington campus has a power capacity of 50 megawatts (MW) and currently operates over 10,500 mining machines, with a total investment of over $100 million.\nZach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, expressed his appreciation for the successful execution of the expansion, highlighting the technical expertise and support from the local community. He stated, \"This expansion has already helped us get more than halfway to our year-end guidance of 16 EH/s.\"\nCleanSpark has been actively pursuing growth opportunities, particularly during the recent bear cycle. Last month, the company acquired a turnkey bitcoin mining campus in Dalton, Georgia, consisting of two sites, for $9.3 million. In addition to that, in the same month the company announced the acquisition of more than 12,000 cutting edge mining machines. \nThe expansion in Washington, Georgia, has marked another milestone for CleanSpark as it continues to increase its bitcoin mining capacity.",

The order states that the court cannot conclude that XRP is a security under the law insofar as “programmatic sales” are concerned.

If approved, MATIC will be replaced with the new token that will function on all Polygon networks. Litecoin also rallied, hitting a one-month high.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) jumped to a multi-week high on Thursday, as traders reacted to the news that some of the project’s founders have proposed replacing the network’s MATIC token.\n \nIf successful, POL will be the new official token of Polygon, and this news has been boosting the price of MATIC/USD to a peak of $0.7668 today.\n \nAs a result of this, MATIC moved to its highest point since June 9, when price reached a high at $0.7890.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the surge in price came after the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 60.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 62.34, with the next visible point of resistance at the 70.00 level.\n \nIn the event this ceiling is hit, MATIC will likely be trading above $0.8000.\n \n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nLitecoin (LTC) also surged higher in today’s session, as traders pushed price above the $100.00 mark.\n \nFollowing a low of $94.79 on Wednesday, LTC/USD raced to an intraday peak at $101.45 earlier in the day.\n \nOverall, this is the strongest level the token has hit since last Thursday, when it peaked at $105.95.\n \n \nThe jump comes after bulls rebounded following a breakout below a support point at $95.00, with the RSI hitting a floor of its own at 53.00.\n \nCurrently, price strength is at a reading of 57.88, with LTC continuing to record higher highs as the day progresses.\n \nA ceiling of $102.00 is now the obvious target, and should the price push past this point, there is a good chance LTC hits $105.00 in the coming days.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect momentum in litecoin to remain bullish in the coming days?
