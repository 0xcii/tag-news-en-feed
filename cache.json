Flatcoins, stable currencies that change their value according to the inflation in a determined jurisdiction, have surged as a crypto-based solution for the issue.\n \nFlatcoins and Their Proposal\n \nThe problem of rising inflation has gained notoriety this year as large world economies that had traditionally kept prices relatively under control were affected by a loss of purchasing power. For example, U.S. inflation touched 9.1% during 2022, reaching one of its highest levels since 1981.\n \nThis rise prompted a swift response from the Federal Reserve, which started hiking interest rates to address inflation.

          "description": "The decentralized crypto exchange Sushi is expanding to the Aptos blockchain. The team noted that the move marks Sushi’s first expansion onto a non-EVM blockchain.\n \nFrom Ethereum to Aptos\n \nSushi is a decentralized exchange (dex) and automated market maker (AMM) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade crypto assets and provide liquidity in return for rewards. Launched on August 28, 2020, The dex also has a native governance token called SUSHI.\n \n“By leveraging Aptos’s Move programming language, Sushi is initially introducing its v2 Automated Market Maker (AMM), with more integrations to come,” Sushi said in its announcement. The Sushi team believes the Aptos integration will unlock deeper cross-chain liquidity and elevate the trading experience across chains.\n \nAptos is a new layer one (L1) blockchain focused on scalability and claims to provide reliability, security, and usability. Its Move programming language enables developers to build Web3 applications in a different fashion. As a non-EVM chain, Aptos represents new territory for Sushi, the developers remarked.\n \n \nAccording to the announcement, “This expansion to Aptos not only unlocks a new level of deep liquidity across major blockchain networks but also significantly elevates the cross-chain trading experience.” Sushi’s team insists the decision will strengthen its leading cross-chain position by spreading to Aptos.\n \nSushi was once a top dex but volume has dropped considerably over the past few years. Defillama.com statistics show that the dex platform has $347.23 million total value locked across various protocols. Sushi’s TVL has also lost a great deal of value since November 2021, after holding more than $8 billion.\n \nWhat do you think about Sushi expanding to the L1 blockchain Aptos?

The new offering removes the previous 32 ETH minimum staking requirement.\n \nStaking for All: Coinbase Cloud and Kiln Break Down Minimum Barriers\n \nWith the integration of Kiln’s onchain staking platform, Coinbase Cloud and its clients can enable partial ETH staking. This allows wallet providers like Coinbase Wallet to give users the ability to earn staking rewards without needing to meet minimums. The press announcement notes that over 99 percent of ether wallets hold less than the 32 ETH previously required to stake on the network.\n \n“We are thrilled to have worked with Coinbase Cloud and to welcome them as the first (non-Kiln) node operator leveraging the Kiln Onchain Staking Platform,” said Kiln CEO Laszlo Szabo. The Kiln CEO added:\n \n \nThis integration with Coinbase Cloud is unique because it allows them to enable other wallets and services, including [decentralized exchanges], with the same limitless [ether] staking solution that will be offered by Coinbase Wallet.\n \n \n \nPartial ETH staking builds on Coinbase Cloud’s existing staking infrastructure. The company said its multi-cloud, multi-region setup ensures reliability alongside trusted security standards. Coinbase further discloses that staking operations occur transparently onchain through audited smart contracts.\n \nCoinbase posits that by removing staking minimums, more individual users can participate in securing the Ethereum network while earning rewards. The move comes as staked ETH ratios continue rising after Ethereum’s recent upgrade. Coinbase Cloud is currently offering this new open staking access starting with integration in Coinbase Wallet.\n \nWhat do you think about Coinbase and Kiln’s announcement?
