          "description": "The performances of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the last bull cycle have led to the hunt for their replacements in this cycle, and the likes of BONK and WIF continue to make a play for the positions. BONK rallied more than 1,000% in 2023 to reach a market cap of over $1 billion, reminiscent of Dogecoin’s 2020 rally. As BONK swims to the fore as a possible replacement for DOGE, another Solana-based meme coin, dogwifhat (WIF) is putting on a performance that could qualify it as the next Shiba Inu.\n \nWIF Scores Robinhood Listing\n \nWIF seems to be following the same path as Shiba Inu, although on a more accelerated timeline. WIF, which had lagged for a few weeks after its launch on the Solana blockchain, began a monster run that took its market cap from just a couple of hundred thousand dollars …",

          "description": "In a high-profile case that has garnered considerable attention, Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced CEO of the now-bankrupt FTX crypto exchange, is seeking a lighter sentence, citing his autism spectrum disorder.\n \nBankman-Fried’s lawyers argue that his condition makes him “uniquely vulnerable” in a prison environment and should result in a reduced sentence of five to six years instead of the maximum 110-year term recommended by sentencing guidelines. \n \nSam Bankman-Fried’s Lawyers Argue For Reduced Sentence\n \nAccording to a Fortune Magazine report, in a sentencing memo filed by Bankman-Fried’s legal team, they contend that his autism spectrum disorder puts him at a “higher risk of violence” and extortion from other inmates due to his behavior. \n \nSam Bankman-Fried’s attorneys also note that…",
