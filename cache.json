This time would be different if the meme coin reached this market cap, as its price would still be below its current ATH of $0.73. \n \nWhy Dogecoin Reaching An $80 Billion Market Cap Isn’t A New ATH\n \nDogecoin community member John Carter explained in an X post that DOGE reaching an $80 billion market won’t mark a new ATH for the meme coin primarily due to its inflationary status.
