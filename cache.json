Preston Pysh and Lyn Alden have also recently joined them as a General Partner in the second fund. \nThe successful first close demonstrates the surging appetite among investors to allocate capital to the expanding Bitcoin technology sector. \nAccording to Ego Death founding partner Nico Lechuga, \"While there are a number of Bitcoin-only VC funds investing at the Seed stage, there was no Series A-focused fund to support the rapidly developing ecosystem.\"\nJeff Booth commented, \"There are almost no words to describe the feeling of having a front seat in the creation of value on a protocol that brings truth, hope, and abundance to 8 billion people.\"\nThe ability of prominent venture funds to raise sizable funds focused purely on Bitcoin startups signals the maturity and growth of the broader ecosystem.
