          "description": "In a blog post, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revisited the pivotal Bitcoin block size debate that starkly divided the Bitcoin community mainly from 2015 to 2017. Engaging deeply with two authoritative books, Buterin re-examined the historical nuances of this schism from his unique perspective as both a participant and a thought leader in the crypto space.\n \nButerin’s blog entry, entitled “Some reflections on the Bitcoin block size war,” unpacks the contrasting narratives provided by Jonathan Bier’s The Blocksize War and Roger Ver and Steve Patterson’s Hijacking Bitcoin. These books represent the pro-small-block and pro-big-block viewpoints, respectively, offering a lens into the ideological and technical divides that characterized the debate.\n \nBitcoin Small Blockers Vs.

His latest forecast says the bitcoin-to-gold ratio could reach 100 ounces after a consolidation period.\nThe veteran trader tweeted, \"Since its inception, Bitcoin $BTC has gained against Gold. This chart shows the # oz. of $GC_F to buy one BTC. The ratio should chop for another 12 to 18 months -- then advance to 100 oz of GC to buy a BTC.\"\n \n                         \n                         \n                        \nPeter Brandt on X\n \n                     \n                    \nCurrently, the BTC/GLD ratio sits around 29, meaning it takes 29 ounces of gold worth $68,000 to purchase one Bitcoin. But Brandt expects this ratio to triple to 100 ounces after Bitcoin's next consolidation phase ends.\nAt today's gold prices, 100 ounces would make one bitcoin worth over $234,000 - representing a 230% price increase.\nBrandt has long been bullish on Bitcoin versus Gold. Since its creation in 2009, Bitcoin has massively outperformed the traditional haven asset, gaining over 375,000% against Gold in that time span.\nThe trader believes Bitcoin still has ample room to run versus Gold despite already seeing such enormous relative gains. The BTC/GLD ratio chart shows Bitcoin's long-term uptrend against Gold with room to advance.\nBrandt expects Bitcoin to continue significantly outshining Gold in the years ahead. With the approval and successful launch of the US Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year, its reputation as a digital store of value continues to grow among institutions.",
