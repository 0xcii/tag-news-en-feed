This came despite the global crypto market cap shifting lower, down 1.65% as of writing. Dogecoin was also higher, as the meme coin rebounded from Wednesday’s losses.\n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nLitecoin (LTC) has been one of Thursday’s biggest gainers, as prices rose by as much as 13% in today’s session.\n \nLTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $91.70 in today’s session, a day after falling to a low of $79.95.\n \nAs a result of the move, LTC climbed to its strongest point since March 3, when the token reached a peak of $95.49.\n \n \nOverall, the move has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average closer to an upwards crossover with the 25-day (blue) moving average.\n \nAlthough some will be anticipating a cross, there appears to be a hurdle in place, which comes in the form of a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 55.35, which is marginally below the aforementioned resistance zone at 56.00.\n \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) was also higher in today’s session, as the meme coin rose to a five-day high.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.07213 on Wednesday, DOGE/USD rose to a peak of $0.07819 earlier today.\n \nThe move saw DOGE rebound from yesterday’s losses, hitting its highest point since last Saturday in the process.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, today’s surge has sent the 10-day (red) moving average to the brink of a cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nThis typically is a sign of upcoming rallies, which like with LTC, will have to come once the RSI breaks free of a current point of resistance.\n \nPrice strength is currently tracking at 51.38, which is slightly below a ceiling at the 52.00 mark.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect dogecoin to move higher in upcoming days?
