          "description": "In the ongoing criminal case against Sam Bankman-Fried, federal prosecutors have unveiled a forfeiture bill, indicating the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) intent to commandeer two luxury jets belonging to the ex-FTX chief. Specifically, the DOJ has its sights set on a Bombardier Global 5000 BD-700-1A11 and an Embraer Legacy 135BJ.\n \nProsecutors Set Sights on Seizing Bankman-Fried’s Luxury Aircraft\n \nOn the evening of October 4, the DOJ detailed its plans to seize these high-end aircraft from Bankman-Fried, co-founder and former CEO of FTX. The court order highlighted that these jets are implicated in multiple charges, specifically counts 1-4 and 7, of the federal indictment.\n \n \nIn addition to the Bombardier and Embraer jets, the DOJ is also keen on acquiring their associated maintenance and engine logs. This development comes on the heels of earlier reports, post-FTX’s downfall, which suggested that Bankman-Fried’s personal aircraft had made multiple trips between the Bahamas and Argentina.\n \n \nContradicting these claims, Bankman-Fried had asserted he never left the Bahamas. Adding another layer to the narrative, there were whispers that FTX’s private jets were repurposed to ferry Amazon packages to top-tier FTX personnel, given Amazon’s refusal to deliver to the Bahamas. In a related twist, Ryan Salame, FTX’s former co-CEO, reportedly had to part with his private jet as a bargaining chip in his plea negotiations.\n \nWhat do you think about Sam Bankman-Fried losing his jets to forfeiture?

          "description": "On this day 14 years ago, the Bitcoin price was born. \nAs noted in a post on X today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo, October 5 marks the anniversary of the date on which NewLibertyStandard, a pseudonymous early Bitcoin user made public the first U.S. dollar price valuation for Bitcoin.\nA home miner at the time, NewLibertyStandard notably used the price of electricity to calculate the exchange rate, factoring how much it cost for him to power his personal computer as he mined coins with little competition.\nAt the time, he reached the conclusion that 1,309 Bitcoin were worth $1, meaning that a single U.S. dollar could buy the Bitcoin produced by 26 blocks.\nThe calculation marked the first time that anyone had priced Bitcoin above zero. As noted by Rizzo, Satoshi Nakamoto never priced Bitcoin, nor, as far as we know, offered to buy or sell Bitcoin for dollars.\n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \nThe date is notable as since then, Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency, has achieved a staggering milestone, with its price soaring by over 3.6 billion percent. \nFast forward to the present day, and Bitcoin has become a household name, a symbol of financial innovation, and a store of value. It has weathered countless ups and downs, regulatory challenges, and market cycles, emerging as a resilient and highly sought-after asset.\nThe exponential growth of Bitcoin's price is a testament to its unique features and value propositions. Here are some key factors that have contributed to Bitcoin's remarkable ascent, including its adoption by the market. \nSo, while NewLibertyStandard remained only a personal buyer and seller of Bitcoin, he remains one of its founding fathers, helping to create the conditions for later markets to flourish within a global Bitcoin economy.",
