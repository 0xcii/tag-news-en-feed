          "description": "CleanSpark Inc. has announced the purchase of 12,500 Antminer S19 XP bitcoin mining machines for a total price of $40.5 million. The machines were acquired at a lower price than the current market average, costing $23 per terahash, according to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. The purchase agreement states that 6,000 of the machines will be shipped in June, with the remaining 6,500 set for shipping in August.\nZach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, expressed his confidence in the purchase, stating, \"This purchase ensures that we are prepared to meet and potentially exceed our year-end target of 16 EH/s and also positions us to be one of the most power-efficient miners on an energy-per-hashrate basis.\" He further highlighted the optionality provided by the additional machines, allowing the company to replace less efficient units if the economics support it.\nCleanSpark reported that it has been taking advantage of discounted machine purchases during the crypto bear market. In February, the company acquired 20,000 Antminer S19j Pro+ units, followed by the purchase of 45,000 Antminer S19 XP units in April. \nGary A. Vecchiarelli, CFO at CleanSpark, emphasized the importance of these purchases in preparation for the upcoming bitcoin halving, stating, \"the efficiency of these machines also results in less power consumed per bitcoin mined compared to older generation miners, which should translate to higher margins.\"\nCleanSpark's recent purchases of bitcoin mining machines demonstrate the company's commitment to expanding their mining capacity and staying competitive in the market. With fees from Ordinals inscriptions boosting the revenue for miners, it is expected that large players like CleanSpark will continue to bolster their miner inventory.",

          "description": "Litecoin rose by as much as 6% in today’s session, as the token climbed past a key resistance level on Thursday. The move came following several attempts over several weeks, with bulls finally breaking through. Polygon was also higher, ending a recent losing streak. \n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nLitecoin (LTC) was one of Thursday’s notable gainers, as prices moved past a key resistance level.\n \nFollowing a low of $88.35 on Thursday, LTC/USD rose to an intraday peak at $94.21 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of today’s rally, litecoin broke out of its recent ceiling at $93.00, hitting a two-week high in the process.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that Thursday’s surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 58.00.\n \nSince the breakout, the index has continued to climb, and as of writing this is currently tracking at 59.76.\n \nIn the event momentum continues in this direction, there is a strong chance that LTC will move above $95.00.\n \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) snapped a three-day losing streak on Thursday, following a crossover of moving averages (MA).\n \nThe 10-day (red) MA crossed its 25-day (blue) counterpart in today’s session, sending the price to a peak of $0.8974.\n \nThis comes following Wednesday’s low at $0.8787, which saw MATIC hit its weakest point since May 25.\n \n \nOverall, market volatility in polygon remains significantly high, with earlier gains almost fading.\n \nAs of writing, MATIC is trading at $0.8934, with the RSI at a reading of 46.03, which is close to a ceiling of 48.00.\n \nShould this aforementioned point of resistance be broken, bulls could force a move toward $0.9000.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect polygon to move above $0.9000 this week?
