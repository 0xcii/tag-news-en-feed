The exact launch date remains unannounced.\nThe move reflects Sony's growing push into Bitcoin and crypto. By leveraging the Amber Japan exchange, Sony can capitalize on its brand recognition and global reach to boost the adoption of its future Bitcoin and crypto offerings.\nJapan has emerged as a leading Bitcoin market due to proactive regulation and high consumer awareness. This makes it an ideal place for Sony to debut and expand services.\nMajor corporations like Sony embracing Bitcoin and crypto signal wider mainstream momentum.
