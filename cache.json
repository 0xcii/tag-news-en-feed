Like bitcoin, the four tokens – Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter – go through regular halvings of the supply from mining. Every nine months, the rate of production of one of the tokens is cut in half. On the 6th of March, the Summer halving took place. Summer went from being produced at the fastest rate of the four tokens, to the slowest.\n \nAs the market adjusts to the lower rate of supply after a halving, the token that was previously the cheapest gradually becomes the most expensive. This happened with Spring after its halving in June of last year. The same process is now unfolding with Summer. Autumn tokens, which are now produced at the fastest rate of the four, have become the cheapest token, and…",
