          "description": "The cornerstone of the modern approach to money laundering is to prevent illicit funds from entering the financial system. The rationale is understandable: if criminals won’t be able to use their money, they will have to eventually stop whatever they are doing and go get a 9 to 5 job.\nHowever, after 20 years of ever tighter (and ever more expensive) AML regulations, the levels of organized crime, tax evasion, or drug use do not show any signs of decrease. At the same time, the basic right to privacy is being unceremoniously violated on an everyday basis, with each financial operation, no matter how tiny, being subject to extensive verifications and tons of paperwork.
