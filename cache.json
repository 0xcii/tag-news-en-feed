          "description": "After recovering its bullish momentum, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, Bitcoin (BTC), briefly broke above its key resistance level of $28,700. However, the cryptocurrency retracted and returned to trading within its range formed in the last week between $27,600 and $28,500. \n \nDespite this choppy price action, a recent blog post by Justin Bennett, trader and analyst of the crypto market suggests that BTC has established “strong” horizontal levels, which are favorable for both scalpers and investors who prefer this period of range or consolidation in the market.\n \n \nWill These Horizontal Levels Hold A Potential Decline In BTC’s Price?\n \nBennett further mentions that Bitcoin trades above the $28,130 pivot point on an hourly and 4-hour closing basis. Any attempt to retest this level…",

          "description": "Dogecoin (DOGE) came into the spotlight during the 2021 bull market after mounting an impressive rally fueled by billionaire Elon Musk posting about the coin on his Twitter account. However, the meme coin has since lost most of those gains as the bear market has raged on. With Dogecoin sitting about 90% below its May 2021 all-time high, the question is now whether DOGE will ever reach $0.7 again.\n \nCan Dogecoin Reclaim $0.7?\n \nDogecoin is still holding steady as one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the space but a worrying fact about the cryptocurrency is that it has an unlimited supply.
