The truth is that freedom, privacy and censorship-resistant technologies are important for everyone, regardless of political leanings and they should not be politicized, lest we head down the path toward a dystopian future with no privacy or free speech guarantees, and only centralized institutions controlled by people with the ability to censor, revoke and remove important guarantees of freedom promoted in the spirit and language …",

          "description": "Nodal Power, who mitigates methane at landfills by powering Bitcoin mining data centers, announced that the company has successfully raised $13 million in a seed funding round aimed at aggressively curbing methane emissions from landfills while harnessing their latent energy potential, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.\nA significant portion of the funds has already been deployed for the construction and operation of two power plants within the United States. The first site, located in the southeast US, channels the electricity generated from landfill gas into the local utility grid. This site features data center, enabling the efficient distribution of energy between the utility and the data center. \nThe second site, located in the mountain west region, boasts a pioneering off-grid Bitcoin mining data center, powered by landfill gas. Plans are in place to allocate additional funding for the development of a third site, slated for early 2024. All three sites share the common goal of harnessing renewable electricity from the methane gas generated during the decomposition of organic waste in landfills.\n“We’ve developed solutions, specifically for smaller landfills, that allow us to bring these overlooked resources to market,” said Nodal Power CEO Bryan Black. “Our technology and energy first approach have the potential to make a significant impact on local energy markets.”\nNodal Power's initiative carries the potential to substantially reduce methane emissions originating from landfills. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is known to be 25 times more adept at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The company's approach involves combusting methane gas within generators, a strategy that not only mitigates methane but also cuts down on carbon emissions when compared to traditional flaring or venting practices. This process thereby transforms a previously wasted resource into a beneficial energy source.\nMore details about Nodal Power and their initiatives can be found here.",

For admitting to committing the offense, Helio is said to have entered a “recognisance” of $9,560 (AUD15,000) for 12 months which is contingent on the crypto lender’s good behavior.\n \nHelio Said to Be in Breach of Australian Consumer Protection Law\n \nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) announced on Aug. 17 that the Melbourne-based cryptocurrency lender Helio Lending has been sentenced for falsely claiming it held a credit license. According to the regulator, such a claim is in breach of section 30 of Australia’s National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009.\n \nIn a statement, the Aussie securities regulator revealed that the license claim was made in an article that appeared on Helio’s website in Aug. 2019. The regulator argued that Helio portrayed itself as a licensed entity when it knew full well that it was not a holder of the Australian Credit License (ACL).\n \n\n \nCommenting on her organization’s punishment of Helio, ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said:\n \n\nWe expect entities and individuals to provide accurate information to their customers and potential customers. Helio falsely claimed that it held an Australian Credit Licence (ACL), misleading their customers to believe that they had the protections afforded by such a licence.\n \nFor admitting to committing the offense, Helio is said to have entered a “recognisance” of $9,560 (AUD15,000) for 12 months which is contingent on the crypto lender’s good behavior. However, the regulator said the second charge relating to the content seen on Helio’s website has since been withdrawn.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
