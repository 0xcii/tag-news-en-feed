          "description": "After weeks of significant volatility and uncertainty, Bitcoin is currently at a turning point. The recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, coupled with the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, has led to erratic price movements, causing traders to navigate a landscape filled with anxiety. \n \nDespite this tumultuous environment, key data from CryptoQuant indicates that confident holders hold a substantial portion of the Bitcoin supply.
