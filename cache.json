          "description": "People involved in financial tech, software programming, cyber security, and cryptocurrencies have been talking about the Lastpass data breach that was disclosed two days ago. The password management company detailed that a breach, committed earlier this year, allowed hackers to obtain a “backup of customer vault data.”\n \nLastpass Reveals ‘Threat Actor Was Also Able to Copy a Backup of Customer Vault Data’\n \nOn Dec. 22, 2022, the password management firm Lastpass disclosed that an “unknown threat actor” managed to breach the firm’s cloud-based storage environment in or around Aug. 2022.

Another person people are curious about these days is Alameda Research’s ex-co-CEO Sam Trabucco. The 30-year-old executive left Alameda in Aug. 2022, but since Ellison detailed misconduct happened in 2019, it’s assumed that Trabucco knows a thing or two about what happened.\n \nSpotlights Remain on a Few More FTX and Alameda Execs Like Sam Trabucco\n \nSince Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was arrested and then later released on bail, attention has been drawn toward executives who have not come forward, or at least not publicly announced they have been cooperating with law enforcement.\n …",

We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto.\n \n \nIn the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances. \n \nWe kicked us this special with an institutional guest, asset management firm Blofin. In early December, they wrote an essay called “Catastrophe, Survival, and Evolution: Writing After November’s Crypto Markets” which inspired this series.\n \nBlofin: “One of the apparent signals is that in Dec…",
