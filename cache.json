In contrast, the Antminer S21 has a hash rate of 200 TH/s and a power consumption efficiency ratio of 17.5 J/TH.\nGao also highlighted how durable the S21 Pro is.\n\"It has the ability to deal with more challenging environments,\" she said, before sharing that the device can withstand temperatures of up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit).\nThe after coupon U.S. dollar to terahash rate for the device is $18.9/TH and Bitmain will begin shipping the device in Q3 2024.\nThis announcement comes just seven months after Bitmain launched the S21.\nThe S21 was quickly adopted by Bitcoin miners, as it has already sold out via the company's website.\n \n                         \n                         \n                        Bitmain no longer has Antminer S21 mining devices in stock. \n                     \n                    \n\"We truly believe this new product will be helpful for you to make your long-term plans for your mining expansion, especially before the new cycle,\" added Gao.\nFor more information on the Antminer S21 Pro, keep an eye out for updates on Bitmain's website.",

He cites Metcalfe’s law, a network effect model, to estimate the top crypto’s current “fair value” at $50,000.\n \nThe upcoming halving, which cuts miner rewards in half, is expected to disrupt supply dynamics and historically has been followed by price surges. However, Yusko acknowledges the emergence of transaction fees as a new wrinkle, potentially mitigating the immediate impact of the halving on miner profitability.\n \n \nThis cycle might be a …",

This led to a massive depeg event, which triggered the bank run on bankrupt crypto lender Celsius.
