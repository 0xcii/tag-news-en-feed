In addition, it can be argued that those users with NFTs matter the most, as in a Web3 metaverse like Decentraland, users with NFTs such as ones that denote ownership of real estate in Decentraland (LAND) or wearable items that unlock some of the more popular experiences like ICE poker are the ones who are most active in the platform, and certainly are the most valuable to the ecosystem’s success.",
