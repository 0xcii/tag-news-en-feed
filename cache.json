          "description": "Today, Bitcoin only exchange, Swan Bitcoin, welcomed NBA Champion Matthew Dellavedova to its team as Vice President of Business Development, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Dellavedova is most well known for his illustrious professional basketball career and achievements in the NBA, including an NBA Championship in 2016 with the Cleveland Cavaliers and an Olympic bronze with the Australian national team in 2020.\nDellavedova, who has been actively involved in start-up investing and advisory roles since 2017, is now turning his attention to the Bitcoin industry. “I’m excited to be joining Swan to help spread adoption, especially in sports and Australia, where I'm still playing professional basketball,” said Dellavedova. “It's already been a lot of fun learning from the experts at Swan, and I look forward to educating athletes, in particular, about the benefits of Bitcoin.”\nHis recent engagement with the Saint Mary’s men’s basketball team, his alma mater, demonstrated his dedication to introducing Bitcoin to athletes, especially in light of the recent Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rule changes that present new opportunities for college athletes.\nOne of the key aspects Dellavedova is focusing on is how Bitcoin can help young athletes save for their future. Given Bitcoin's inherent properties that prevent debasement, it is considered a reliable asset for long-term value preservation and appreciation.\n\"Matt is a savvy businessman and investor. He’s obviously a disciplined and incredibly hard worker,\" said Swan founder and CEO Cory Klippsten. \"But the biggest reason we brought Delly onto the Swan squad is his dedication to spreading Bitcoin adoption and the audience he can reach outside the Bitcoin industry.\"\nMatthew Dellavedova's transition from the basketball court to the Bitcoin arena exemplifies the growing interest and potential of Bitcoin in various industries, with notable figures using their influence to promote its adoption and benefits.",

We’re speedrunning Bitcoin Consensus.\nWhat is the debate about?\nOrdinal Theory describes how to serialize & track satoshis. These satoshis, when serialized, are called “ordinals”.

          "description": "According to Yuga Labs, creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), the team has partnered with the popular Japanese fashion brand A Bathing Ape, commonly known as Bape. They plan to unveil a new “irreverent collection” together at Apefest in Hong Kong this November.\n \nBAYC Partners With Fashion Brand Bape\n \nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club is teaming up with streetwear company Bape for a new collection, Yuga Labs announced. Founded in 1993 by Nigo (Tomoaki Nagao) in Ura-Harajuku, Bape is a renowned Japanese fashion brand. The company operates 19 stores globally, offering men’s, women’s and children’s lifestyle and streetwear.\n \n“Together, the two brands have reimagined iconic designs from Bape’s deep archives and usher in a return to the golden age of streetwear collecting,” Yuga Labs said on September 25. “With one foot in Bape’s Ura-Harajuku roots and the other in the BAYC swamp, this collection offers Bape heads and BAYC members exclusive access to apparel and accessories that reflect their shared appreciation for laid back opulence and irreverence.”\n \n \nThe recent news about BAYC and Bape comes after a notable decrease in the value of BAYC non-fungible token (NFT) assets this year. BAYC NFT floor prices have plummeted, and weekly sales volumes have consistently decreased. This isn’t BAYC’s first partnership with a prominent streetwear brand; they teamed up with Adidas in 2021 and also worked with music-focused magazine Rolling Stone on an exclusive cover design.\n \n“As Fashion goes hand-in-hand with Web3, particularly in the current times, where the two have the power to impact each other almost instantaneously, we are thrilled to present this groundbreaking collaboration with Yuga Labs,” Thomas Hui, chief operating officer at Bape said.\n \nWhat do you think about BAYC teaming up with Bape?
