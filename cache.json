This year, the primary cryptocurrency’s price resurgence has been the major talking point, moving from $16k to $24k in a few weeks. \n \nThis trend continued as Bitcoin surpassed the $25k mark for the first time since August 2022 this week, and some experts had predicted that the $30k could be the next resistance point.

Given the strong rejection at $25k, analysts believe Bitcoin may enter a period of consolidation before making a fresh move. \n \nRelated Reading: Do…",
