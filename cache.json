          "description": "Tron moved closer to being in the cryptocurrency top 10 on Wednesday, as the token rose for a second straight day. Prices climbed by nearly 2% in today’s session, despite the global market cap moving marginally lower. Polygon, which currently occupies the tenth position, fell to a five-month low. \n \nTRON (TRX)\n \nTRON (TRX), rose by as much as 2% on Wednesday, as the token moved closer to entering the cryptocurrency top 10.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.06841 on Tuesday, TRX/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $0.07031 earlier in the session.\n \nAs a result of this jump, TRX is now marginally above a long-term resistance level of $0.070.\n \n \nIt appears that the target for bulls could be to not only break this ceiling, but move to $0.072, which would see the token hit a three-month high.\n \nOne of the main obstacles preventing this is the relative strength index (RSI), which is currently tracking at 59.67, below resistance at 60.00.\n \nIf and when price strength moves beyond this point, there will likely be more bulls reentering the market.\n \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) which is currently the world’s tenth largest cryptocurrency, fell for a fifth straight day.\n \nMATIC/USD plunged to a bottom at $0.866, less than a day after the token was trading near $0.90.\n \nThis latest decline in price has pushed polygon to its lowest point since January 11, when it traded at $0.84.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, this spell of sell-offs has sent the RSI below 30.00, which is deep in oversold territory.\n \nThe last time price strength tracked this low was back in July 2022, which may give bulls optimism that a reversal could be soon approaching.\n \nMATIC is now trading at $0.8723, which is marginally higher than its earlier lows.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould MATIC fall further this week?
