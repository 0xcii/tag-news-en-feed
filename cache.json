This means that for every four games launched, three have disappeared. Coingecko’s analysis also shows that during this period, the number of Web3 games that failed averaged 80.8% each year.\n \n\n \nAs per Coingecko’s data, the failure rate during the five years was the highest in 2019 (94.3%) and 2020 (94.4%). However, in 2021, the year of the last crypto bull run, 339 out of 738 games failed, translating to a failure rate of 45.9%.\n \n \nIn terms of the actual number of failed games, Coingecko’s analysis identifies 2022 as the year with the highest number of dead games with 742. The failure rate in that year stood at 107.1%, meaning it was the only year when the number of failed games was higher than those launched (693).\n \nMeanwhile, the analysis shows that 2023 has the second-highest number of games launched (720), while 2020’s 86 game launches are the least in each of the five years reviewed.

          "description": "In the past six months, Bitcoin miners’ revenue has dropped by more than 30%, with November revenues approximately $270 million lower than October revenues. The drop in Bitcoin miners’ revenue is attributed to Bitcoin price volatility, increased competition, and higher electricity prices.\n \nGradual Decline in Miner Revenue\n \n\n \nBitcoin miners’ revenues have fallen by over 30% in the past six months, despite the gradual increase in the price of Bitcoin from its March 10 low of just over $20,000 to just over $38,000 on Dec. 1, 2023. According to banklesstimes.com data, miners’ November revenue of $615.1 million is approximately $300 million less than the January revenue.\n \n\n \nSince reaching a high of $918.8 million in January, miners’ revenue has gradually declined in the months that followed. The month of October was the only time this trend was bucked, with miners securing the second-highest monthly earnings of 2023 at $885 million.\n \n\n \nCommenting on the drop in miner revenue, Alice Leetham, an analyst at Banklesstimes, said:\n \n\nThis downturn has sparked widespread interest and concern within the cryptocurrency community, prompting us to delve into the factors contributing to this substantial decline.\n \n\n \nIn the Banklesstimes report, BTC price volatility is identified as one key factor explaining the drop in miners’ revenue. Meanwhile, an earlier report by Galaxy attributes the drop in revenue to what it described as the “incredible increase in network hashrate during the first half of the year.”\n \n \n\n \nThe increase in the hashrate is due to improved mining economics, the oversupply of second-hand ASICs in the secondary market, as well as the plugging in of new generation mining rigs. Other publications have attributed the revenue drop to the surge in energy prices.\n \n\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",
