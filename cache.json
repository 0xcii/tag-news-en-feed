          "description": "XRP was one of Thursday’s notable movers, as the token dropped to a multi-week low in today’s session. The decline comes as the global market cap fell by as much as 2% over the course of the day. Dogecoin also declined, falling for a third consecutive session.\n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, remained in the red during today’s session, as the price fell to a multi-week low.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.6971 the day prior, XRP/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.6589 earlier in the day.\n \nThis is the weakest point that XRP has hit since July 13, when the token was trading below $0.4700.\n \n \nThat day also saw XRP hit its highest point since December 2021, after it was ruled by a U.S. judge not necessarily to be a security.\n \nSince then, sentiment has been largely bearish, with the latest sell-off coming as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a floor at 49.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 48.60, with the next visible point of support at 45.00.\n \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) extended its own stay in bearish territory on Thursday, as the meme coin fell by as much as 5% today.\n \nThe decline saw DOGE/USD drop to an intraday low at $0.07305, less than 24 hours after peaking at $0.07703.\n \nAs a result of this sell-off, dogecoin has fallen to its lowest level since July 24, which is the last time price was trading at a support of $0.07000.\n \n \nSimilar to XRP above, Thursday’s decline comes as a result of price strength falling below a floor at 51.00.\n \nThe RSI is currently at a reading of 50.23, with DOGE trading at $0.07339, which is marginally above today’s bottom.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhere do you expect the next price target for dogecoin traders?

          "description": "Tether, the company behind the world’s most popular stablecoin USDT, acquired 1,529 bitcoin in the second quarter of 2023.\nPaolo Ardoino, the company’s CTO, confirmed the purchase to Bitcoin Magazine. According to the executive, Tether paid roughly $45.4 million to add the BTC to its balance sheet.\nThe purchase confirms the company is following the plans it delineated earlier this year. Tether announced in May that it would start allocating up to 15% of quarterly profits to bitcoin, a move that could challenge popular bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, executive chairman of software intelligence firm MicroStrategy.\nNasdaq-listed MicroStrategy this week announced it acquired 467 BTC in July. Bitcoin has been hovering around the $30,000 mark for a couple months, and the stability seems to have prompted Saylor to pull the trigger and add $14.4 million worth of BTC to the company’s treasury. MicroStrategy currently holds 152,800 BTC, while Tether owns over 54,000 BTC with the Q2 buy.\nBitcoin’s nearly 76% jump year-to-date is renewing institutional interest in the digital currency, with the world’s largest asset manager filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in June. Many asset managers fast-followed $8.6 trillion BlackRock to re-file their previously denied applications. \nWhile the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has denied plenty of similar filings in the past, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts yesterday coined a 65% chance that BlackRock’s filing receives the regulatory green light. Notably, BlackRock’s ETF applications have been denied only once, out of roughly 550 filings.\nThe eventual approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is broadly seen as bullish by the market, and companies such as Tether and MicroStrategy would be set to benefit the most from the assumed price appreciation of the coin. Coincidently, the deadline for the SEC to issue a decision on most of these ETF applications aligns closely with the Bitcoin halving – another event widely perceived as positive for the future of bitcoin’s price.",
