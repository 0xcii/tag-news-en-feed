          "description": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is finally showing signs of life, having had a sluggish performance for the longest time. The meme coin recently crossed the $0.12 mark and has been trading at its highest level since November 2022. \n \nDogecoin Back In The Game\n \nDOGE climbed back into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap following its recent price surge. Bitcoinist previously reported that the meme coin had dropped out of the top 10 crypto due to its lacklustre performance. DOGE had failed to impress even while other crypto tokens were recording new highs as of late. \n \nHowever, that looks to be in the past following DOGE’s recent resurgence. The crypto token is up by over 35% in the last 24 hours and has reclaimed a market cap of $18 billion in the process. This parabolic move no doubt has DOGE’s inv…",
