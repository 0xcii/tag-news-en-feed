Dubbed \"crypto winter,\" the unforgiving market crushed the hopes of many traders, startup founders, and investors. \nMarked by scandals, regulatory uncertainty, and lots of FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt in crypto parlance), crypto winter brought down some of the industry's most significant projects and companies. \nHowever, the US SEC’s successive approvals of eleven spot BTC ETF applications on January 10, 2024, changed all perspectives, turning many bullish. \nIt’s not just institutions that are optimistic about the development. Even smaller retail traders are excited about the new ETFs. If you are a retail trader sharing your strategies and showcasing a public crypto portfolio for your audience, the risin…",
