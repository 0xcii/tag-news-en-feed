The country has taken an institutional interest in Bitcoin, with its sovereign fund purchasing BTC since prices were around $5,000.\nBhutan announced last year it was raising $500 million to boost mining operations. By framing mining as both a commercial opportunity and crisis mitigation tool, Bhutan has embraced Bitcoin more fully than most nations. Its renewable hydropower reserves also make it an ideal location for eco-friendly mining.\nThe new investment in cutting-edge mining hardware comes as the Bitcoin network faces a halving in mid-April. The quadrennial event cuts block rewards for miners in half, impacting revenue.\nBhutan cited offsetting the halving's impact as a motivation for expanding its mining operations. Bitdeer has one of the lowest costs per Bitcoin mined in the industry at $20,000 per coin, far below the global average of up to $45,000.\nThe remote Himalayan nation has also viewed Bitcoin mining as a way to boost rural economies and jobs.",
