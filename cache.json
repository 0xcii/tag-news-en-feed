          "description": "Casey Rodarmor, the creator of the Ordinals protocol, made a surprising return to the public eye during the Ordinals Summit held in Singapore this week.   \nThe appearance marks Rodarmor's first public engagement in months, following a period of isolation after the protocol's launch in January of this year. He previously broke his silence most recently with a lengthy podcast in which he aired his concerns about Paul Storzc's drivechains upgrade proposal.\nThe Ordinals Summit, a gathering of NFT enthusiasts, was a notable celebration of the protocol at a time when its use has seemingly declined. The software, which allows digital artifacts to be traded like NFTs on the Bitcoin network, had previously garnered significant attention and praise from collectors and earned criticism for breaking crypto's rigid cultural lines.\nThe growing popularity of the Ordinals protocol among NFT collectors had taken Rodarmor by surprise. It gained traction rapidly, filling a niche in the market for Bitcoin enthusiasts who wished to participate in the NFT space. However, this success also drew the ire of some Bitcoin proponents who were staunchly against NFTs, though the reasons for the critiques varied from moral to technical objections.\nIn response to this polarized reaction, Rodarmor chose to step back from the limelight temporarily, focusing on refining the Ordinals protocol. Last week marked a notable change with Rodarmor merging an upgrade that helps more clearly establish provenance for the inscriptions that comprise a specific collection.\nIn his keynote address, he expressed gratitude for the support the community had shown and emphasized the need for innovation within the cryptocurrency space.\nThe Ordinals Summit was attended by a diverse range of developers and enthusiasts, all keen to explore the potential of the Ordinals protocol and its impact on the future of NFTs. Notable speakers included Udi Wertheimer, creator of the Taproot Wizards NFT project and, Domo, the pseudonymous creator of the BRC-20 protocol.",

Metrics for the first half of September do not show improvement, with decentralized exchange trade volumes at about $16.96 billion as of September 18, 2023. \n \nDex Volumes Nosedive 37% Post-May\n \nDex trade volumes have fallen significantly over the past four months. Data indicate that March saw the year’s highest dex trade volume at $112 billion. In April, volumes declined by 47.26% to $59.06 billion.\n \nMay experienced a 12.59% increase, with trade volumes rising to $66.5 billion; of that amount, Uniswap’s dex trades contributed $33.67 billion. Since May, however, dex trade volume has declined by 37.29%.\n \n\n \nAugust data indicate dex trade volume at $41.7 billion, with $24.87 billion, or 59.64%, coming from Uniswap trades. Pancakeswap saw $6.76 billion in trades, while Curve Finance contributed $3.79 billion.\n \nThose three dex protocols totaled $35.42 billion in August, making up 84.94% of the month’s global dex volumes. Although September isn’t finished, its dex volumes to date already appear lackluster.\n \nAs of September 18, 2023, the global dex trade volume stands at $16.96 billion. Approximately $10.27 billion of that total comes from Uniswap trades, about $3.14 billion from PancakeSwap, and $1.07 billion from Curve.\n \n \nWith only 12 days remaining in September, dex trade volumes might finish below August’s numbers. The data is further highlighted in a monthly crypto recap report by the digital asset manager Vaneck, which indicated a decline in August’s onchain economic activity tied to decentralized finance (defi).\n \n“Decentralized exchange volume experienced a more severe decline,” wrote Matthew Sigel, Vaneck’s head of Digital Assets Research.\n \nWhat do you think about the recent dex trade volume downturn?
