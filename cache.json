          "description": "Solana had previously touched $200 earlier in the year but this was only for a brief period before declining back down to $150. At this point, the Solana indicators are beginning to flash bullish, prompting crypto analysts to predict a resurgence above $200 for the altcoin.\n \nSolana Shows Growth On D1 Timeframe\n \nCrypto analyst Maximilian FX has predicted that the Solana price could be on its way to a resurgence.
