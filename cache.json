The enterprise emphasized that only a “small number of Binance users” would be affected by this development.\n \nBinance to Discontinue Visa Offering by Year’s End\n \nIn 2023, crypto debit cards have been falling out of favor rapidly, triggered in part by a series of bankruptcies that ignited a crypto bear market. Back in March, Bitpay in the U.S. phased out its prepaid Mastercard program, although it assured users of a renewed card service on the horizon. However, this week, holders of the Binance Visa card were informed via email that the card would cease to be functional by the close of the year.\n \nThe email communicated that the Binance Visa card would become non-operational post-December 20, 2023. The Binance Visa, which was available to users in Europe, was utilized by individuals across various countries including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, the Czech Republic, and Finland, among others. Binance has suggested that cardholders can switch to Binance Pay for their shopping needs, provided the service is accessible in their region.\n \nThe email also clarified that, despite the changes, Binance accounts would remain unaffected and continue to operate as usual. A lively discussion about the Binance Visa card issue has taken place on social media. “Binance shutting down their Visa card,” one person said. “The [Gnosis Pay] card cannot come soon enough! wen shipping?” Another user expressed indifference towards the shutdown, expressing a preference for the Crypto.com Visa card instead.\n \nWhat do you think about Binance shutting down its Visa service?

          "description": "Yesterday’s FinCEN rule proposal is incredibly overbroad, comprehensive, and perfectly designed to allow arbitrary information collection at any scope they choose to enforce. It truly is a mind-blowingly large grab attempt at private information of anyone they can get their hands on. They want all regulated entities — VASPs, banks, financial institutions or entities like casinos, etc. — to by default submit reports of any transactions interacting with mixing within 30 days of noticing the relevant transaction and its association to mixing activity. Currently, most exchanges and businesses keep these records anyway, but they do not by default send copies of them to regulators unless deeper inspection actually merits a reason to do so. FinCEN wants that to change.\nTo really get a sense for t…",
