Through this partnership, users can now use a debit card or credit card to purchase satoshis which arrive in the app’s wallet shortly thereafter.\nThe update also brings the arrival of the activity page, a feed which shows popular episodes and clips. The release describes how, “This is just the first of many new social discovery features we will be adding to Fountain that use money as a signal for value.” \nIn addition to these larger updates, several UI changes were implemented, including a new content card design, the ability to reply to clips, clips and comments being displayed on the episode pages under Activity and more. \nThrough the Fountain app, podcasters can receive sats for the content they provide, while listeners can receive sats for likes on their comments or clips. Streaming your favorite podcaster sats on a minute-by-minute basis provides a direct link between the consumer and the content creator, and is a way to empower these creators using Lightning. \nBy facilitating this value for value model, podcasters can avoid external sources of funding. In many industries, but especially in the Bitcoin industry, these external sources can introduce conflicts of interest which can potentially even prove harmful to consumers who trust their favorite podcasters. With software like Fountain, these consumers can directly support these podcasters and reduce the potential for such events.",

          "description": "Solana surged by as much as 22% on Monday, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. The move saw the token climb to its highest point since November, when it was embroiled in the FTX collapse. Cardano also moved higher to start the week, climbing by nearly 13%.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) was one of Monday’s big movers, as prices of the token rose by as much as 22%.\n \nSOL/USD surged to an intraday high of $16.62 to start the week, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $13.47.\n \nToday’s rise in price pushed SOL to its strongest point since November 12, days after the token plummeted, after being exposed to the FTX/Alameda scandal.\n \n \nFrom the chart, Monday’s rally came following a breakout of a key resistance level at the $15.00 mark.\n \nAs a result of this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has risen to 73.26, which is its strongest point since April.\n \nDue to prices now being relatively overbought, there is a strong possibility that there could be a reversal in momentum in the coming days.\n \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) was another notable gainer to start the week, with the token climbing for a second straight day.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.2865 on Sunday, ADA/USD hit a high of $0.3409 earlier in today’s session.\n \nLike with solana, this move saw cardano hit its highest mark since November, and came after a breakout of a ceiling at $0.3250.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, as a result of today’s rally, the 14-day RSI rose to a level not seen since September 2021.\n \nDue to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, and as of writing, ADA/USD is trading at $0.3247.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould cardano rally back beyond this resistance level in the coming days?
