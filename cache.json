Friday’s stronger than expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report has made some question the Federal Reserve’s view that inflation has peaked. Ethereum also declined on Monday, however, it remained above $1,600.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) started the week falling to a seven-day low, as market sentiment began to shift downwards.\n \nBTC/USD has now fallen lower for five straight sessions, with today’s decline taking prices to a bottom of $22,734.48.\n \nThis drop sees bitcoin hit its weakest point since January 30, when prices were trading at a floor of $22,500.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the world’s largest cryptocurrency appears to be heading towards this point of support once again.\n \nRecent declines in BTC have come as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a floor at 68.00. It is now tracking at 61.15.\n \nThis is the lowest reading for the index in nearly a month, and comes following an extended streak in overbought territory.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) also moved lower on Monday, however prices were able to remain above the $1,600 level despite the decline.\n \nFollowing a high of $1,665.26 on Sunday, ETH/USD dropped by as much as 2% in today’s session, hitting a low of $1,616.30 in the process.\n \nAs a result of this sell-off, ethereum moved closer to its recent support level at $1,600. However, bulls have so far rejected a collision.\n \n \nThis has been helped by the RSI, which has found its own floor at 58.00, providing a soft landing for previous bulls.\n \nETH has since rebounded from earlier losses, and at the time of writing, is trading at $1,630.55.\n \nShould this RSI floor of 68.00 hold, ethereum bulls may attempt to make another move towards $1,700 as the week progresses.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat is behind today’s reversal in cryptocurrency prices?
