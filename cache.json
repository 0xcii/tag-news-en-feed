It was uncovered that these assets had been  \ntransferred to overseas digital wallets prior to an official announcement  \nregarding changes in terms and conditions, contradicting the information  \nprovided by Zipmex Thailand to regulators.\nIn  \nits statement, the SEC asserted that Zipmex Thailand had engaged in fraudulent  \nbehavior by presenting false statements regarding the handling of customer  \nassets. Yimwilai served as the CEO of Zipmex Thailand from August 2018 until  \nNovember 2023, as indicated by his LinkedIn profile.\nZipmex Thailand operates  \nas a subsidiary of the Singapore-based Zipmex, led by Marcus Lim. The company  \nreceived approval to operate from the Ministry of Finance and SEC in 2020.  \nHowever, in response to the SEC's findings, the commission issued an order for  \nZipmex Thailand to suspend its digital asset trading and brokerage services. A  \nnotice on the company's website and mobile app indicates that both platforms  \nhave been disabled.\nFurthermore,  \nthe SEC alleges that reports submitted by Zipmex Thailand were inconsistent  \nwith the information obtained during the investigation. Consequently, the SEC  \nhas filed a formal complaint against Yimwilai with the Office of the Provincial  \nCrime Suppression Division, urging further legal action to be considered.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Tareq Sikder at www.financemagnates.com.",
