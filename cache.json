          "description": "Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

(Mawson) has signed an agreement for a new site in Corning, Ohio, with an initial capacity of 24MW.\nAccording to a press release, the site, signed on a long-term lease, has an additional 26MW of potential capacity upside, subject to further infrastructure investment, which would take the total site to 50MW. \nThe site is expected to go live in Q3 2023 and will initially host 12 modular data centers (MDCs) and 7,056 miners. The new site will expand Mawson's potential capacity to up to 290MW, highlighting the company's focus on the Pennsylvania and Ohio region.\nMawson's CEO James Manning said, “This is the first of several smaller sites the Mawson team has been working on, with a focus to deploy low cost, quick to market mining facilities.” COO Liam Wilson added, “We are actively planning for the halving event, and plan to have the most efficient fleet possible — as always, focusing on shareholders return on capital. We are focused on this region for various reasons and look forward to seeing which ASIC units perform best before ordering in bulk.”\nThe new site is an addition to the existing 240MW of capacity that Mawson has online and under development in the surrounding area. The company's goal is to provide a possible increase in deployable hashrate of up to 1.0 EH/s. Mawson's infrastructure includes a proprietary modular data center (MDC) design that aims to reduce deployment time and capital expenditure.",
