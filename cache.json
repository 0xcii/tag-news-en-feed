Buckley has been publicly critical of Bitcoin and opposed offering Bitcoin ETF products to clients. \nUnder Buckley's leadership, Vanguard refused to provide its brokerage customers access to U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs that were approved by the SEC.\nThe appointment of Ramji, set to take effect July 8, signals a potential change in Vanguard's stance. As head of BlackRock's iShares division, Ramji oversaw the launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.\nRamji has spoken positively about the technology underpinning Bitcoin and its potential to remove friction in financial markets. \nHis experience pioneering Bitcoin ETFs at BlackRock has many wondering if he will now push for similar offerings at Vanguard.\n \n                         \n                         \n                        Click the image to learn more. \n                     \n                    \nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, bringing in the bitcoin-friendly Ramji means the door is \"much more open now\" for Vanguard to embrace Bitcoin.\nThe company offers index funds and ETFs to both retail and institutional investors. \nAs a massive player in the ETF space with over $7 trillion in global AUM, Vanguard launching a spot bitcoin ETF would be an important milestone for further mainstream adoption.",
