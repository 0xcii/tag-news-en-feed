He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

We constantly transact in money, think in money and strive to earn more of it. However, few genuinely understand what money is, and even those who do often perceive it in very different ways. \nSome say that money is a form of energy that can be transformed and exchanged.

The global crypto market cap is down 0.15% at the time of writing, as volatility remains high. Chainlink also moved higher in today’s session.\n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nLitecoin (LTC) bounced from a key point of support to start the week, as the token rallied, despite Monday’s crypto red wave.\n \nFollowing a low of $84.92 on Sunday, LTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $88.89 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of this move, litecoin moved further away from its price floor at $86.00, and is now trading at its highest point since last Friday.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has now risen to a point of resistance at 45.00, leading to LTC giving up earlier gains.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.33, with litecoin trading at $88.11.\n \nShould price strength move beyond the 45.00 mark, there is a good chance that LTC will be back above $90.00.\n \n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nChainlink (LINK) was also in the green in today’s session, and the token rose by as much as 2%.\n \nLINK/USD climbed to a peak of $7.25 to start the week, following a low of $6.92 on Sunday.\n \nToday’s rebound sees LINK move away from the three-and-a-half-week low registered over the weekend.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, this coincides with the RSI bouncing from a floor of its own at the 44.00 mark.\n \nCurrently price strength is tracking at 45.09, with a resistance point at 47.00 a potential target for bulls.\n \nShould it hit this mark, then it is likely that LINK will move above $7.30.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat has been behind today’s bearish sentiment?
