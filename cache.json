The latest outflow means the value of digital asset investment products under management has dropped by a total of $294 million or 0.9% in the past four weeks. The Coinshares data shows bitcoin (BTC) as the digital asset which had the highest net outflow ($69 million) in the first week of September.\n \nBitcoin Short Inflows the Largest Since March\n \nDuring the first week of September, digital asset investment products saw a net outflow of $59 million in assets under management (AUM), the latest data from the alternative asset manager Coinshare analysis has shown. According to the asset manager’s blog, the latest net outflow figure brings the value of total outflows in the past four weeks to $294 million, or 0.9% of total AUM.\n \n\n \nAs explained in the blog, inflows were also seen in short investment products and this may be an indication that the sentiment for digital assets remains poor. Concerns over the regulation of this asset class and the strengthening dollar are cited as some of the reasons why investors are less keen on investing in digital assets.\n \n \nIn terms of flows by asset, the Coinshares data shows bitcoin (BTC) as the digital asset that had the highest net outflow ($69 million) in the first week of September. On the other hand, short bitcoin net inflows during the same period topped $15 million, the largest since March 2023.\n \nMeanwhile, Ethereum’s net outflow of $4.8 million during the same period saw its year-to-date outflows rise to US$108m representing 1.6% of the total AUM of $6.9 billion. Out of all the digital assets tracked by Coinshares, only XRP and other unidentified digital assets are shown to have recorded positive inflows of $0.7 million and $0.4 million respectively.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

          "description": "In a recent appearance on Fox Business, Anthony \"Pomp\" Pompliano suggested that a significant Bitcoin bull run is on the horizon. Pompliano, a well-known figure in the Bitcoin space, shared his insights on the future of Bitcoin and why he believes it is primed for another surge.\nPompliano began the discussion by highlighting the recent volatility in the market, with Bitcoin experiencing a period of fluctuation in recent months. However, he emphasized that this is not unusual for the market and is part of the asset class's nature. Pompliano stated that such volatility should not deter investors from considering Bitcoin as a long-term investment.\nOne of the key factors driving Pompliano's optimism is the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. This year, numerous prominent companies, including BlackRock and Fidelity, filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC, signaling a shift in the perception of Bitcoin from a speculative asset to a legit store of value. Pompliano believes a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved by the end of this year, while more institutions also recognize the value of holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.\nPompliano also discussed the potential for Bitcoin to disrupt traditional financial institutions. He argued that Bitcoin's decentralized nature and borderless accessibility could challenge the dominance of central banks and traditional financial intermediaries. While acknowledging the regulatory challenges that Bitcoin faces, Pompliano believes that innovation will ultimately prevail and that Bitcoin will play a significant role in the future of finance.\nAnthony Pompliano's optimism about a forthcoming Bitcoin bull run is rooted in the growing institutional adoption, international recognition, and the potential for Bitcoin to reshape the financial landscape. As Bitcoin continues to evolve and mature, it remains a topic of great interest and debate among investors and financial experts alike.",
