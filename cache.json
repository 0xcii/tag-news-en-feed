          "description": "DMG Blockchain Solutions, a bitcoin miner and cryptocurrency technology company, announced that the firm has purchased 4,550 T21 Antminer bitcoin miners from Bitmain Technologies. DMG detailed that it paid $12.1 million for the next-generation application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners which equates to $14 per terahash a second (TH/s).\n \nDMG to Expand Fleet With Latest Purchase From Bitmain\n \nDMG has revealed it has purchased 4,550 T21 Antminers from Bitmain and it expects to get 1.06 exahash per second (EH/s) from the new units. The firm detailed that the miners cost $12.1 million and were financed through both cash and liquidated bitcoin (BTC). The mining firm is expecting the units to arrive sometime in March 2024.\n \nThe T21 Antminer produces 190 TH/s but can be overclocked to 233 TH/s, DMG detailed in its announcement. The company aims to ship the miners to the firm’s Christina Lake data center facility. “DMG is planning to utilize its previously purchased mining containers, which are in the process of being installed at its Christina Lake facility in advance of taking delivery of the T21 miners,” the company said in a statement.\n \n\n \nDMG added:\n \n\nThis new fleet, in combination with expected rationalization of its existing fleet, will help DMG improve its overall fleet efficiency anticipated to be below 25 J/TH post-halvening, which is expected in April 2024.\n \nThe news follows several mining operations acquiring ASIC bitcoin mining machines. Iris Energy just recently acquired 7,000 T21 Antminers from Bitmain and Riot Platforms secured 66,560 ASICs or 18 EH/s from Microbt. DMG mined 64.7 BTC in November and by the end of the month, the firm held a total of 429 BTC worth $18,801,182 using prevailing exchange rates.\n \nWhat do you think about DMG’s latest purchase?

I'm sure Naka thought this over. His first Bitcoin must have had an incremental reduction of the supply per block. But the final design, the one we know, cuts the block reward in half only after every 210,000 blocks (every four years). Obviously, this decision had a tremendous impact on price action, volatility, and adoption. Unfortunately, it’s not the best supply scheme. Let's explore.\nHalvings\nBitcoin, as we know it, has a supply schedule adhering to the following hard coded rule:\n \n         \n         \n         \n        The mathematical formula of the supply decrease. \n    \nFor the non-mathies, this is the sum (Σ) of all the new…",

Ten years on, what was first created as a “joke” has gone on to become one of the largest cryptocurrencies with a large community to boot. \n \nHow Dogecoin Came To Be\n \nEngineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer created Dogecoin, and interestingly, the duo is said to have created the meme coin as a parody of Bitcoin. It was created at a time when cryptocurrencies were just garnering hype and was done as a way to satirize them. That would explain why the Japanese Shiba Inu dog was chosen as the meme coin’s logo.\n \n \nUpon creation, Dogecoin began to gain some ground in the world of cryptocurrencies as it was seen as the fun and less serious crypto token.

Over the course of history, different monetary systems have risen and fallen as technology progressed and new forms of money emerged that were superior to what came before. To help us understand money, we must examine the question: “who controls the ledger?” As we explore the technological history of money and its various incarnations, from informal social credit to commodity-backed systems, we can gain insight into how control over the monetary ledger impacts individual liberty, economic prosperity, and human flourishing. \nIn the Austrian tradition, figures like Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, and many others have written extensively about the function of money.
