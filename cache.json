Polygon also extended recent declines, hitting a multi-week low as a result. \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) hit an all-time low in today’s session, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remains bearish, following recent economic data.\n \nADA/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.2845 earlier in today’s session, less than a day after trading at $0.3026.\n \nToday’s sell-off comes as cardano fell for a third straight session, breaking out of a key support point in the process.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the aforementioned floor is at the $0.3000 mark, which was broken once before, on November 21.\n \nThe 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also moved below a floor of 35.50, and as of writing is tracking at 30.91.\n \nThis is the lowest point the index has hit since October 22, with prices hitting a bottom of $0.3100 on that occasion.\n \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) was another notable token to fall today, with prices also moving lower for a third straight day.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.891 on Thursday, MATIC/USD dropped to a bottom of $0.8483 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of this drop, polygon moved to its lowest point since November 30, when prices hit a bottom of $0.837\n \n \nMATIC has since rebounded from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $0.8569, which is still nearly 4% lower than Thursday’s floor.\n \nThis slight rebound comes as the RSI rejected a breakout of a point of support at the 43.00 level, and the index is currently at the 44.26 mark.\n \nHistorically, bulls have used this floor as a point of reentry, and should this reoccur, then we could see MATIC move back towards the $0.90 level.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat other factors are behind today’s decline in crypto prices?
