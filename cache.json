To support the miners, Bitcoin needed something new to spur growth, and that was Ordinals. Ordinals drove huge demand to send Bitcoin transactions.

In line with this, a crypto expert has given his opinion as he stated reasons why this allegation may be true.\n \nCrypto Expert Believes XRP Price Is Suppressed\n \nIn a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, pro-XRP crypto YouTuber Jerry Hall stated that he believes that the price of the token has been suppressed for years. He noted that the moment he began to have this belief was when he realized that Ripple was selling into the market on a monthly basis. \n \n \nAccording to him, the fact that Ripple does this to finance their business shows that he and the company have different goals. He also seemed to suggest that Ripple didn’t care about XRP holders as he stated that “bag holders are …",

Antpool specified on November 30 that the individual has a deadline of December 10, 2023, to reclaim the fee from the mining pool. \n \nDeadline Announced by Antpool for Refunding Massive Bitcoin Transaction Fee in Suspected Hack Case\n \nRecently, the cryptocurrency community observed an exceptionally large transaction fee, where 83.65 BTC, valued at over $3 million, was remitted to miners. This transaction, confirmed in block 818,087, was processed by Antpool, today’s most dominant mining pool by hashrate. Following this event, an unidentified user on the social media platform X disclosed that this fee originated from their bitcoin holdings, which were allegedly compromised by hackers.\n \nThe user also provided a signature, verifying their claim by signing a message with the private keys of the address. On November 30, Antpool issued a statement regarding the erroneously paid fee, declaring its readiness to refund the owner of the address. “On November 23rd, some user submitted 83 BTC as a gas fee,” Antpool disclosed. “The risk control system of Antpool temporarily froze the fee when packaging the transaction.”\n \n\nPlease contact us before 00:00 (UTC+8) on December 10, 2023 and verify personal identity in the following way. After verification, Antpool will refund the fee.\n \n \nConfirming the user’s identity could be crucial for Antpool, as there’s a prevailing notion that the hacker might still possess the key, and the alleged victim might actually be the perpetrator. The user is required to sign the address and forward it to Antpool’s email for verification purposes.\n \nWhat do you think about Antpool detailing that it would refund the massive fee it mined?
