Over this period, the TVL in defi has experienced a robust growth of 34.40%. \n \nDefi TVL Set to Break $50 Billion Barrier\n \nIn recent times, the top ten defi protocols have shown remarkable performance, with the leading two liquid staking applications spearheading this growth.

Not to be outdone, Uniswap, ranking fifth in terms of TVL size, grew by 15.16% this month, closely followed by Summer Finance with an impressive 18.62% leap. The only exception in the top ten was STUSDT, which saw a marginal decline of 0.33% over the month.\n \nThe defi landscape also witnessed significant double-digit growth in Spark and Blast. However, Juststables encountered a 29.95% decrease in its TVL value over the last 30 days, and Tron’s SUN protocol also recorded a 23.77% reduction in the same period.

Bitcoin secures the 11th spot in the ranking of the largest TVLs by blockchain.
