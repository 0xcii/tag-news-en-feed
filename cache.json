          "description": "OCEAN Mining has released an update to their pool software allowing miners to individually choose between a set of different block templates to mine on. Miners can choose between these three templates at this time: \n\nThe default OCEAN Knots template, which filters out any inscription transaction, as well as places an additional OP_RETURN limitation of a maximum of 42 bytes on transactions using OP_RETURN. \nBitcoin Core patched with the Ordisrespector update, filtering out inscription transactions. \nThe default Bitcoin Core template which implements no additional transaction filters at all. \n\nThis new option is a stepping stone towards their ultimate goal of enabling Stratum v2 in order to allow any miner using the pool to construct whatever block template they wish to while mining with the…",

So much so that “crypto” itself became an unworthy moniker to describe Bitcoin’s weight and significance.\nFor Bitcoin maximalists, Bitcoin is Bitcoin and cryptos are altcoins, if not shitcoins. Now that Bitcoin is heading for a bull run, boosted by the 4th halving hype and Bitcoin ETF approvals, Saylor’s MicroStrategy is already over $1.2 billion in unrealized profit territory.\nThe Bitcoin meme maker himself wasted no time in visualizing the payoff from his Bitcoin maximalism strategy.\n\n\n\nWith such results on the table, it’s time to examine Bitcoin maximalism more closely.
