The judge found that the operators of the facility were in contempt of another judge's court order.\nUnder the agreement, US Bitcoin would be required to comply with a series of standards for noise reduction and permit applications. These include limiting noise production from the facility to no more than 65 decibels and submitting completed applications for all permits needed to comply with the city's new “high energy usage overlay district,” the report details.\n\nThey would also have to compensate the city in several ways, including paying an upfront, non-refundable $50,000 fee upon execution of the agreement. In addition to the $50,000 upfront fee, US Bitcoin would be required to pay the city a $100,000 compliance fee within 30 days of the agreement's effective date.\nThe company would also be required to reimburse the city for $180,000 in attorney fees and costs tied to its enforcement action against the company, as listed in the agreement.\nThe Niagara Falls City Council still has to approve the agreement.",
