Market sentiment has mostly been bullish in the past two weeks, leading to prices hitting a multi-month high on Monday. Bitcoin cash also surged, climbing to its strongest level since July.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) rose by over 11% in Monday’s session, as the token raced to a multi-month high earlier in the day.\n \nFollowing a low of $24.04 on Sunday, SOL/USD surged to an intraday peak of $26.93 to start the week.\n \nAs a result of this move, solana climbed to its highest level since November 8, when price hit a high of $31.78.\n \n \nThis is the fourth straight session that solana has risen, with prices breaking out of a key resistance level of $26.00 in the process.\n \nIn addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has moved beyond a ceiling of its own at 62.00.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 63.58, and should it continue in this upward direction, SOL could hit $30.00 in the coming days.\n \n \nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n \nAnother notable gainer on Monday has been bitcoin cash (BCH), which also moved to its highest point in the past several months..\n \nBCH/USD raced to a high of $146.83 earlier in the day, which comes after trading at a bottom of $134.55 on Sunday.\n \nThe rally took bitcoin cash to a point not seen since July 31, when the cryptocurrency traded above $150.00.\n \n \nThis comes as the 10-day (red) moving average nears a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nAdditionally, the RSI has also moved to a 16-day high, and is tracking at 65.85, which is near a ceiling of 66.00.\n \nShould price strength pass this hurdle, then BCH bulls will likely recapture the $150.00 mark.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat is behind today’s rally in bitcoin cash?

The lack of savings vehicles and the availability of debt create a potent mix of terrible incentives at the individual level. Lack of savings vehicles mean that individuals have to work to keep any value they have and the availability of debt means that they can bring forward a lot of consumption.\nThe result is a lot of people who consume and relatively few productive people who save.\nWhy Companies?\nOne level higher from the individual level…",
