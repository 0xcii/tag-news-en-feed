The funding round was led by two venture capital firms, Raed Ventures and Cur8 Capital, with the participation of several angel investors.\n \nAccording to a Techpoint Africa report, Zeal’s latest capital raise announcement came less than a year after the fintech startup received an Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) tax relief advanced assurance. The United Kingdom’s tax authority HM Revenues and Customs (HMRC) uses this to determine if a company qualifies for the tax benefits associated with the schemes.\n \n \nOmar Ebeid, the CEO of the customer loyalty fintech startup, suggested that the capital raised will also be used to enhance Zeal’s connection with customers.\n \n“This investment will accelerate our journey towards utilizing AI to revolutionize retail customer engagement on a global scale. We are committed to broadening our impact, with a focus on connecting billions of customers with millions of retailers,” the CEO said.\n \nMeanwhile, Wael Nafee from Raed Ventures said there is a belief that Zeal’s “holistic product” will eventually become an important solution for the world’s payment service providers and POS [point of sale] machines.\n \nRegister your email here to get a weekly update on African news sent to your inbox:\n \n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

According to TruthLabs, there is transactional evidence linking the Ethereum Foundation to the substantial Gatecoin hack of 2016, an event preceding the infamous DAO hack.\n \nAt the heart of this exposé is a series of Ethereum wallet addresses and their interlinked transactions, painstakingly traced back to the moments preceding the hack. The thread opens with a bold statement from TruthLabs, “Proof of the Ethereum Foundation’s involvement in the Gatecoin Hack in 2016, prior to the DAO exploit,” setting the tone for a narrative that unfolds a complex web of t…",
