These mainstream retail investment products comprise over 75% of funds held by EU citizens.\nIf Bitcoin is approved for UCITS, it would enable Europe's first mainstream access, meaning that fund managers could allocate small portfolios to Bitcoin within the massive framework.\nESMA is gathering input until August 7 before making recommendations. The move follows Bitcoin ETF approvals in the US and Hong Kong, which have signaled a warming global regulatory attitude globally.\nStill, obstacles remain regarding Bitcoin custody under existing EU regulations. Rules like the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) legislation may require coordination on asset segregation.\nNonetheless, ESMA's proactive approach recognizes Bitcoin's growing relevance across Europe. \n \n                         \n                         \n                        Click the image to learn more. \n                     \n                    \nLawyer Andrea Pantaleo states the impact could eclipse recent Bitcoin ETF launches. While those products are Bitcoin-focused, UCITS comprises diverse fund types with varying asset allocations.\nSo, approval wouldn't necessarily create standalone Bitcoin funds. But it would unlock the trillions in UCITS for modest Bitcoin exposure.\nThis could significantly benefit liquidity while encouraging EU adoption. However, a long road remains before Bitcoin's inclusion given strict EU standards.",
