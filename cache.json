This signals a phase of “extreme greed,” a sentiment intensity not witnessed since the cryptocurrency’s previous bull run in November 2021.\n \nSoaring Bitcoin Drives Greed Index to New Highs\n \n\n \nOn Jan. 9, 2024, the CFGI, available on alternative.me, soared to its highest level of 76 out of 100 since its last peak in November 2021.
