After huge losses on Monday, bulls have seemingly moved to buy the dip in price, pushing the global market cap 1.55% higher as of writing. Solana also surged in today’s session.\n \nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n \nBitcoin cash (BCH) rose by as much as 6% on Tuesday, as bulls returned to the market following recent declines in price.\n \nAfter falling to a low of $181.38 to start the week, BCH/USD raced to a peak of $198.93 earlier in the day.\n \nThis rally saw bitcoin cash snap a four-day losing streak, which pushed price close to a support level at $180.00.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it appears that this was the trigger bulls needed in order to return to the market.\n \nThe 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also bounced at a floor of its own at the 35.00 mark, and is now tracking at 37.58.\n \nShould today’s momentum extend through the rest of the week, there is a good chance that BCH will rise towards a key resistance level of $220.00.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) was also in the green during today’s session, as it rebounded from a recent multi-month low.\n \nSOL/USD peaked at $18.66 on Tuesday, which comes a day after the token bottomed out at $17.46.\n \nMonday’s low saw solana fall to its lowest point since June 30, when price was at a low of $17.12.\n \n \nEarlier gains have somewhat faded, however, as bulls were unable to penetrate the ceiling at the $19.00 mark.\n \nThis has led to traders opting to secure their profits, instead of keeping positions open at this point of uncertainty.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould solana move above $20.00 this week?

          "description": "Six years ago, in a now-famous CNBC interview, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon made headlines with scathing remarks about Bitcoin, calling the digital money system that transcends international borders a \"fraud\" that will \"eventually blow up.\"\nIn September 2017, during a conference in New York, Dimon stated that Bitcoin was only suitable for \"drug dealers and murderers.\" He would later take back the comments in 2018 after Bitcoin passed $20,000 that year.\nAt the time, the Bitcoin market was still in its infancy, and many traditional financial leaders viewed it with skepticism. Dimon's comments would reverberate through the financial world, but little did he know that his words would come back to haunt him.\nFast forward six years, and the tables have turned dramatically. Bitcoin has not only survived but thrived, becoming a legitimate asset class and a household name. Its price has skyrocketed, making early investors fortunes and attracting institutional interest. Bitcoin's market capitalization has surged, and it has gained widespread acceptance as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.\nIn the years following Dimon's comments, Bitcoin defied all odds and surged in value, rising over 500%. Bitcoin was trading at just over $4,000 at the time of the comments, but trades routinely at above $25,000 today.\nAs Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo commented on X today, the comments stand in stark contrast given Wall Street's recent reversal on Bitcoin, with top firms including Blackrock and Fidelity filing for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\nJP Morgan began selling Bitcoin to high net-worth clients in 2021.",
