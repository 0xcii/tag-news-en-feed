However, after the bankruptcy filing, BitNile determined the facility was no longer economically viable and began moving the equipment to its Michigan data center, which is expected to be completed by the end of February 2023. \n\"Although this situation is very frustrating, we are moving through the legal process with Compute North and have control over our equipment. We believe the decision to relocate our mining equipment provides us the ability to best execute our future deployment plans,\" said Milton \"Todd\" Ault, III, the company's executive chairman.\nAlong with this news, BitNile reiterated its previous report of having entered into purchase agreements with Bitmain Technologies Limited for a total of 23,065 Bitcoin miners. The company expects to achieve a mining production capacity of approximately 2.66 exahashes per second once all the miners are fully deployed and operational. \nHowever, the company notes that all projections are subject to various factors, including the delivery and installation of Bitcoin miners, the volatility in Bitcoin market price, the fluctuation in the mining difficulty level, and the ability of Agora Digital Holdings Inc. to raise the necessary capital and build out its power facility in Texas.",
