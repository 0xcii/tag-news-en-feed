The update from Debridge will reportedly enable solana users to access ethereum’s virtual machine for the first time. Bitcoin cash extended its own gains on Thursday.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) was a notable mover in today’s session, as the price rose by over 10%.\n \nFollowing a low of $15.75 during Wednesday’s session, SOL/USD jumped to a peak of $18.20 earlier in the day.\n \nThis resulted in the world’s ninth largest cryptocurrency climbing to its highest point in the past 20 days.\n \n \nAs a result of the rally, the 10-day (red) moving average is now on the cusp of an upward crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nAdditionally, the relative strength index (RSI) appears to be nearing a breakout of a resistance point around the 51.00 level.\n \nThe index is currently tracking at 50.87, with SOL at $17.35, after giving up earlier gains.\n \n \nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n \nBitcoin cash (BCH) was in the green on Thursday, racing to a fresh multi-month high in the process.\n \nBCH/USD surged to an intraday high of $247.64 earlier in the day, a day after dropping to a bottom at $223.50.\n \nAs a result of this latest rally, BCH moved to its strongest point since May 11 last year, when price peaked at $249.00.\n \n \nThis latest move comes as the RSI once again broke out of a ceiling at the 80.00 level, after dropping below this point the day prior.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 81.72, which remains deep in overbought territory, and could prompt bears to reenter the market.\n \nDespite this, traders will likely attempt to reach a target at $250.00 first, before any inevitable sell-offs.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill bitcoin cash end the month above or below $250.00?

The financial  \nwatchdog also accused Coinbase of running a digital asset staking-as-a-service  \nprogramme without permission. \nHowever, in  \nits 177-page-long response submitted to the district court  \nin New York yesterday (Wednesday), Coinbase  \nsaid it is not and has never been a securities exchange, broker or clearing  \nagency.  It also argued that cryptocurrencies traded on its platform fall  \noutside the SEC’s authority because they are not ‘investment contracts’ or assets  \npooled from investors to engage in businesses and pay them with profits. Without  \nthis obligation, Coinbase’s listed crypto are not ‘securities’ but ‘just an  \nasset sale,’ the exchange contended.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Solomon Oladipupo at www.financemagnates.com.",
