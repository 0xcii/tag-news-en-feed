It operates across Europe, Asia and the U.S., with over 50 licenses globally. The acquisition will bring Bitstamp's institutional and retail customers under Robinhood's umbrella.\nRobinhood aims to leverage Bitstamp's reputation for resilience and trust to bolster its own Bitcoin and crypto offerings. Bitstamp underwent over a decade of market cycles and maintained high-security standards. \nThe purchase comes as Robinhood faces scrutiny from the SEC over its crypto division. However, Bitcoin and crypto remain a key driver of growth, with transaction revenue from crypto trading jumping 40% last year. Acquiring an established platform like Bitstamp could significantly expand Robinhood's global reach.\nRobinhood general manager Johann Kerbrat said the deal is a \"major step in growing our crypto business\" and will help Robinhood \"expand our footprint outside of the U.S. and welcome institutional customers.\" Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev says, \"We believe crypto will fundamentally reorganize the financial system.\"\nRobinhood has already been offering Bitcoin and crypto trading services in the EU. But buying Bitstamp provides a ready-made base of customers and regulatory licensing across multiple jurisdictions.  As Bitcoin demand increases, the acquisition positions Robinhood to capture growing trading volumes.",
