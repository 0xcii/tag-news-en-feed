ETFs can be bought and sold on stock exchanges and brokerage accounts, with the custody of the underlying asset being held by the manager of the ETF. This allows for investors to get price exposure to bitcoin without having to worry about self-custody or figuring out how to use a bitcoin exchange. This would potentially give traditional investors peace of mind since they could purchase shares of a spot bitcoin ETF directly through their familiar brokerage accounts.\nThere are many types of Bitcoin ETFs available. The futures ETFs have had most success in being approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) thus far, but these track futures contracts …",

It was a watershed moment both for government overreach, as well as for the ability of individual freedom fighters and cypherpunks to push back. As Snowden announced to the world at Bitcoin 2019, Bitcoin was a key tool in his efforts to expose the ongoing surveillance,” said Brandon Green, Head of Events for BTC Inc. “10 years after his initial action, Snowden will talk to our community at Bitcoin Amsterdam about the ongoing fight to protect privacy for individuals, not just in the US, but around the world, and especially right here in Europe. And he will discuss the importance of Bitcoin in that fight,” continued Green.\nAs a prominent advocate for cybersecurity and freedom, Edward Snowden has long expressed his support for Bitcoin, stating \"Bitcoin is free money... When I think about liberty, that’s what this is all about. It’s freedom from permission.\" \nHe views it as an essential tool for preserving financial privacy and protecting individuals from surveillance and censorship. Snowden's endorsement of Bitcoin aligns with its core principles of decentralization, transparency, and financial sovereignty, making his appearance at the Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference highly anticipated.",

The cryptocurrency exchange confirmed that it was adding 22 new loanable and collateral assets to its Flexible and VIP Loan services. Solana was another notable gainer on Friday.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) rose by over 5% on Friday, on the news that  was adding the asset to its Flexible and VIP Loan services.\n \nSHIB/USD hit an intraday peak of $0.000008677 on the news, a day after trading at a low of $0.000008226.\n \nThe move resulted in the meme coin hitting its highest point since Monday, when it peaked at $0.00000872.\n \n \nOne of the catalysts for the surge also seemed to be a breakout of the 60.00 level on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAt the time time of writing, the index is tracking at 62.20, which is marginally below a higher ceiling of 63.00\n \nEarlier gains have already eased, with traders likely securing profits in anticipation of a collision with this zone.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nAdditionally, solana (SOL) returned to the green during today’s session, snapping a two-day losing streak in the process.\n \nAfter falling to a bottom of $22.52 on Thursday, SOL/USD climbed to a high of $23.13 earlier in today’s session.\n \nDespite today’s rebound in price, solana is still trading almost 7% lower than at the same point last week.\n \n \nThe rally began after the RSI bounced from a support level at the 45.00 mark, rising to a current reading of 49.04.\n \nBulls are likely targeting a move back above the $25.00 level, however they will first need to move beyond an upcoming wall of 50.00 on the indicator.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nIs there a possibility that solana will hit $30.00 in August?
