          "description": "Some trends that emerged in 2022, from regulatory developments to technical and cultural innovations, will grow to define Bitcoin in 2023.\nThis is an opinion editorial by Stephan Livera, host of the “Stephan Livera Podcast” and managing director of Swan Bitcoin International.\nAs the 2022 chapter closes, it’s time to turn our eyes to what’s coming in 2023. Here are some themes I’m seeing for Bitcoin in 2023.\nRegulatory Overreach\nThe Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule is forcing exchanges and bitcoin service providers to document and share ever-more information about customer transactions. We are seeing politicians such as Elizabeth Warren publicly go against Bitcoin, and even if her proposed digital asset AML act has no real chance of passing, it does foreshadow that there are…",

          "description": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has continued to decline recently, a sign that may prove to be bullish for the crypto’s price.\n \nBitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio 72-Hour MA Has Been Going Down Recently\n \nAs pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the bitcoin exchange ratio on a 72-hour moving average has been on a decline. The “exchange whale ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 Bitcoin transactions to exchanges and the total exchange inflow.\n \nSince the ten largest deposits to exchanges are usually from the whales, this metric tells us what part of the total exchange inflows is being contributed by these humongous holders. Thus, when the value of the indicator is high, it means whales are making up a high part of the inflow…",

          "description": "Probably the most pressing question for the XRP community at the moment is how the lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission will end. In addition to a ruling in favor of Ripple, the community is also hoping for a settlement that could impose a penalty on Ripple but classify all present XRP sales as non-security.\n \nAttorney John E. Deaton, who is representing 75,000 XRP investors in the lawsuit with an amicus brief, recently put up a poll on Twitter about what outcome the community expects in 2023. Out of 18,000 votes, 59% of people said they expected a settlement between Ripple and the SEC.\n \nSurprisingly, Deaton has changed his mind and is among the 39% who expect a verdict by Judge Analisa Torres. As the attorney explains, he originally believed that the …",
