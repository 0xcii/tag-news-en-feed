Famous inventor and engineer, Nikola Tesla, thought that this connection is all about energy, how often things vibrate, and the way they move. I believe that as well; our perceptions of every aspect of life can be perceived as a transfer of energy, a simple equation.

The following analogies are different ways to help us think about energy, especially how we use it and share it while also respecting nature's wisdom.

It is an asset class that protects you.\"\nFink's recognition of Bitcoin as a protective asset suggests helps shift the narrative surrounding the digital currency, emphasizing its role as a safeguard amid economic uncertainties.
