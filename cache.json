The process is expected to be “very simple” and with “very low,” minimum amounts to operate so that even novice users can take their first steps in the market.\n\"We continue to open the doors of the #cripto world for millions of users in the region: first Brazil and Mexico, and now also #MercadoPago users in Chile can buy, sell and save #Bitcoin,\" Gimenez said in the translated statement.\nMercadoLibre previously enabled the feature for its Brazilian customers in November 2021.
