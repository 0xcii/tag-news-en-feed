Bitcoin briefly moved above $28,000 on the news. \n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) was back above $28,000 on Friday, as fears of further banking collapses pushed traders towards cryptocurrencies.\n \nFollowing a low of $27,359.25 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $28,729.84 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move came as the cost of insuring against a bank default spiked, leading to a resurgence of market uncertainty.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nOverall, BTC has since slipped from earlier highs. However, prices are still higher than Thursday’s bottom.\n \nAs of writing, bitcoin is trading at $27,658.96, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) dropped below a key floor at 65.00.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 64.15, with the next visible point of support at the 60.00 mark.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) briefly traded above the $1,800 level in today’s session, prior to colliding with a key resistance level.\n \nETH/USD rose to a peak of $1,853.89 late on Friday, which came following a prior low of $1,745.02.\n \nThis surge sent ETH to its strongest point since last August, pushing prices marginally above a ceiling at $1,850 in the process.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nETH bulls were unable to sustain this breakout, which has since given way to bears looking to short the market.\n \nAt the time of writing, ethereum is trading at $1,761.72, with the momentum of the moving averages still upwards facing.\n \nThis sentiment may soon shift, should the RSI break out of a floor at 56.00.
