With the UK launch, Strike is now available in 100 countries worldwide. \nJack Mallers said they are committed to growing Bitcoin adoption and providing its services globally despite regulatory complexities. \"Our work is far from done,\" he added.\nTo use Strike in the UK, users must pass an \"appropriateness assessment\" quiz about Bitcoin, which is required under local regulations. The app also includes customary risk warnings.\nStrike offers several features for UK customers, including buying Bitcoin with instant bank transfers, setting recurring purchases, and self-custody withdrawals.\nThe app also utilizes Lightning Network to enable instant, unlimited, and free payments globally between Strike users, providing a frictionless transnational transfer experience.\nWhile Strike said some companies have exited the UK market, its expansion reflects a belief in Bitcoin's potential. The UK presents opportunities as the world's 6th largest economy.\nStrike continues working to make Bitcoin accessible for regular users and businesses worldwide. While region-specific regulations create hurdles, the company aims to comply while delivering key functionality.",
