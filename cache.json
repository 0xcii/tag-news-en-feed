Importantly, the stablecoin's algorithmic monetary policy attempts to remain immune to governance changes or manipulation by administrator keys, aiming to ensure its integrity and reliability.\n“To realize the true value of decentralized finance, crypto needs to break free from infrastructure that is susceptible to exploits and manipulation,” stated Palladium Labs CEO Akash Gaurav. “At Palladium, we designed this stablecoin for resilience and reliability. By leveraging the unique capabilities of the Botanix EVM, we can radically increase the security and reliability of stablecoin access for millions of people using Bitcoin.”\nOperating on the Botanix EVM, which has been in development since early 2023, Palladium leverages the capabilities of this platform to enhance the security and accessibility of stablecoin transactions for Bitcoin users. The Botanix EVM's underlying sidechain protocol, known as the Spiderchain, plays a pivotal role in safeguarding funds transferred from the Bitcoin base layer to the EVM network.\n“The importance of native stablecoins to the technological renaissance happening on Bitcoin cannot be overstated,” said Willem Schroe, inventor of the Spiderchain and co-founder of Botanix Labs. “We are thrilled to support the Palladium team in launching their over-collateralized stablecoin on our EVM network.”\nWith the launch of PUSD on Bitcoin's first EVM Layer 2 network, Palladium and Botanix Labs aim to meet the growing demand for secure and efficient DeFi solutions, seeking to pave the way for a new era of financial innovation on the Bitcoin blockchain.",

The average purchase price was approximately $67,382 per bitcoin.\nThis latest acquisition comes just after MicroStrategy raised $603.75 million through a private offering of 0.875% convertible senior notes due in 2031. The company upsized the planned offering from $500 million after seeing strong demand.\nWith the new 9,245 BTC purchase, MicroStrategy now holds an aggregate total of approximately 214,246 bitcoins acquired at an average price of $35,160 per bitcoin. The company has spent $7.53 billion to accumulate its Bitcoin treasury reserves.\nLed by CEO Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy continues to aggressively execute its bitcoin strategy even amid Bitcoin market volatility. \nThe company aims to hold Bitcoin as its primary corporate treasury asset, taking on debt and issuing equity to raise funds for further accumulation. MicroStrategy now own more than 1% of Bitcoin total supply.\nWhile sceptics argue that bitcoin-backed loans introduce balance sheet risk, Saylor remains staunchly confident in bitcoin's long-term trajectory.
