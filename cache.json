Consumer prices for August are expected to come in at 3.6%, up from 0.4% the month prior. Core inflation on the other hand is forecasted to fall to 4.3%, from 4.7% in July. Ethereum was back above $1,600.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin was once again trading above the $26,000 level in today’s session, as markets prepared for the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n \nFollowing a low of $25,781.12 on Tuesday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak of $26,451.94 earlier in the day.\n \nThe move comes as the world’s largest cryptocurrency continued to move away from a recent three-month low.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nFrom the chart, Wednesday’s surge in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) jumped past a ceiling of 44.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 47.23, with the next visible point of resistance at the 50.00 mark.\n \nIn the case that this level is reached, there is a good chance that BTC will be trading closer to $27,000.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) moved away from Tuesday’s six-month low, climbing back above $1,600 in the process.\n \nETH/USD peaked at $1,616.54 in today’s session, following a bottom at $1,582.22 less than 24 hours before.\n \nAs a result of the rebound in price, the RSI has now moved out of oversold territory, and is hovering below a key ceiling.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nCurrently, the aforementioned resistance sits at 40.00, with price strength currently residing at 39.40.\n \nShould this zone be broken, then there will likely be a push above the $1,620 support point.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \n Do you expect inflation stats to show a rise today?

Once integrated, merchants in the sector will be able to employ them to expand their user base by connecting to Paypal’s payments system.\n \nPaypal Launches On- and Off-Ramps for Web3 Payments\n \nPayments giant Paypal revealed on Monday it’s moving to further increase access to crypto by offering wallets, decentralized apps (dapps) and marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) a simple solution to enable their customers to buy and sell supported cryptocurrencies in the U.S.\n \nThis can be achieved through an integration with the Paypal On and Off Ramps, subject to applicable state laws, the company said, adding:\n \n\nOnce integrated, Web3 merchants can help grow their user base by connecting to Paypal’s fast and seamless payments experience trusted by millions, while leveraging Paypal’s robust security controls and tools for fraud management, chargebacks and disputes.\n \n \nThe fintech firm reminded that it previously launched its on-ramps to enable consumers in the United States to directly buy crypto assets with Paypal through integrations with the Metamask and Ledger wallets.\n \nAdding off-ramps will now allow crypto wallet holders in the United States to directly convert cryptocurrencies to U.S. dollars into their Paypal balance and then use the money to shop, send, save, or transfer to their bank or debit card.\n \nPaypal’s off-ramps solution is already live on Metamask, the press release noted. Last week, the popular Ethereum wallet introduced a “Sell” option allowing users in the U.S., the U.K., and some European markets to cash out ether (ETH) to major fiat currencies and have the amount sent to a bank account or a Paypal balance.\n \nDo you think Paypal will continue to expand crypto payment services for Web3 businesses?
