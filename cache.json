The move comes despite cryptocurrencies mostly consolidating in today’s session, following Wednesday’s rally. Bitcoin was marginally lower, retreating from recent gains.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin edged marginally lower on Thursday, as crypto markets consolidated, following strong gains the day prior.\n \nBTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,111.46, less than 24 hours after nearing a breakout above the $27,000 level.\n \nOverall, it appears that traders have opted to secure gains, abandoning their positions as markets neared a point of uncertainty.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, this area appears to be 51.00 on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAs of writing, price strength is tracking at the 49.64 level, with bitcoin now trading at $26,481.46.\n \nShould bulls navigate a surge beyond this point, there is a good chance that price could move back above $27,000.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) peaked at a one-week high earlier in the day, as price remained above a key level of resistance.\n \nAfter trading at a low of $1,585.37 on Wednesday, ETH/USD raced to an intraday peak at $1,635.46 during today’s session.\n \nAs a result of the move, ethereum hit its highest point since September 20, when price reached a high of $1,649.\n \n \nThis surge comes as the RSI continued to track above a ceiling at the 48.00 mark.\n \nThe 10-day (red) moving average also now appears to be nearing its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which is another sign of pending bullish sentiment.\n \nAn upward crossover will likely result in ethereum moving above $1,700.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect ethereum to consolidate in the coming days?

The blunder was attributed to a transaction ordering issue, as revealed by pseudonymous Bitcoin developer and Spiral grant recipient 0xB10C. The incident underscores the intricacies and potential pitfalls of blockchain technology.\n \nAt the core of the issue was a transaction sequencing problem. Transaction A attempted to spend an input from transaction B, but here lies the crux: transaction B ended up being included in the block after transaction A.
