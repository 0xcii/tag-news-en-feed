Koski’s objective according to the Commission was to not only boost the price of the security that used the symbol COTRP but bolster the value of his portfolio.\n \nTo support these allegations, the SEC claimed that after Koski posted a notice in May 2021 stating that the “JCP debentures would be redeemed early at their full value,” the price of the security went up by 75%. According to the SEC, Koski was aware that his statements were false.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",
