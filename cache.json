Capula's significant investment in Bitcoin ETFs reflects a further growing acceptance of Bitcoin among traditional financial institutions.\nThis investment aligns with a broader trend of institutional adoption, as more firms seek exposure to the potential upside of BTC. The SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has made it easier for institutions to invest in Bitcoin, providing a more accessible and regulated vehicle for participation in this burgeoning market.\nAnd despite Bitcoin's recent plunge from $67,500 to $49,000, large institutions continue to show confidence in Bitcoin. Data from Arkham indicates that major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and MicroStrategy are not selling their Bitcoin holdings, and are likely buying more. \n\nYou guys sold all your coins\n… But\nBlackRock\nMicroStrategy\nGrayscale\nFidelity\ndidn’t. pic.twitter.com/R2NY3rDPcQ\n— Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) August 5, 2024",

The wait to even pass through security and find a seat in the auditorium was hours long and thousands of folks were scrambling to find seats at the Nakamoto Stage early in the day. As the line snaked through the expo hall, it was easy to find an even distribution of Bitcoiners and Trump supporters (some were both) all eager to hear Trump speak. There was an excitement in the atmosphere, and while I didn’t share in the excitement, it did permeate the air in Nashville. Uber drivers were quick to point out that Trump was speaking at the conference. Around the city were large images of Trump’s face next to Bitcoin symbols advertising the…",
