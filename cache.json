He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

Here’s an essential guide to understanding money and its role in today’s economic system.\nIntroduction\nMoney is something that most of us take for granted, as we use it daily to buy goods and services. We constantly transact in money, think in money and strive to earn more of it. However, few genuinely understand what money is, and even those who do often perceive it in very different ways. \nSome say that money is a form of energy that can be transformed and exchanged. Others see it as a technological tool that facilitates trade and commerce. Still others argue that money is a social construct shaped and governed by cultural norms and values. All these views can be correct since the concept of money is much deeper than the way it is c…",

In simple terms, it is a standard measure of value, a common scaling system through which the value of products can be calculated and compared.\nCountries typically have distinct units of account, identified as the national or regional currency, such as the euro (EUR) or the British pound (GBP).

Barter is not suitable as a means to exchange goods and services in an economic system larger than a tribe or family; barter was unsuitable for expanding societies that needed a more efficient method to exchange goods and services. \nHence, about 2,600 years ago, a new and more sophisticated medium of exchange emerged in Lydia — a region recognized as modern Turkey — and materialized with stamped coins to face the challenges of barter and facilitate trade.\nA medium of exchange is an intermediary item that is widely accepted to facilitate the trade of goods and services between two parties.

Ethereum is trading above a floor at $1,830 as of writing.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) is on the brink of registering a downward crossover of its 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.\n \nA recent downtrend, which today pushed BTC/USD to an intraday low of $27,192.03, has also led to an overall shift in market momentum.\n \nThis latest low in bitcoin comes less than a day after the world’s largest cryptocurrency traded at a high of $27,979.98.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nOverall, BTC is trading over 7% lower than at the same point last week, when the price was above $30,000.\n \nIn addition to the potential crossover of moving averages, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continues to hover close to a floor at 42.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.11, with BTC trading at $27,550.00.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also started the week in the red, with prices hovering close to a key point of support.\n \nFollowing a high of $1,888.19 on Sunday, ETH/USD slipped to an intraday low of $1,831.16 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of this move, ethereum fell close to its long-term price floor at $1,830, however bulls have so far rejected a breakout.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \nOne of the reasons that a break has yet to occur seems to be due to the RSI, which continues to trend above support at 44.00\n \nPrice strength is now tracking at 45.58, with a ceiling at 52.00 a potential target for bulls hopeful of recapturing the $1,900 mark.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould ethereum move above $1,900 this week?
