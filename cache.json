As of December 31, the company held 228 bitcoin while it sold 517 bitcoin in December for operations and growth.\nLike other public miners this year, Cleanspark has faced a dramatic downturn in its stock price, just as the price of bitcoin fell similarly. Despite this, when priced in bitcoin, Cleanspark has maintained a relatively steady valuation, and has continued to expand its operations. \nIn September, mining expert Zack Voell detailed how the energy company turned miner is continuing to grow despite the various headwinds currently present in the bitcoin market. This continued with ASIC acquisitions in the following months, as well as record production of bitcoin in October. \nThe December report also detailed the company’s operational reactions to the winter storm which ravaged the United States that month, describing how 98% of its machines present in Georgia were powered down due to the conditions. The machines were turned back on as soon as the temperature and humidity levels permitted.",

          "description": "Lugano, Switzerland makes living on a Bitcoin standard possible with hundreds of merchants that accept BTC.\nIf you’ve ever sought to live entirely on bitcoin, look no further than Lugano Switzerland. \n\nThe Plan ₿ foundation recently took to Twitter to announce a new map which showcases the hundreds of merchants across the city that accept bitcoin. “Now you can live in Lugano just using Bitcoin!,” the tweet read. “Find out all you need to enjoy your stay in Lugano through the map with all Lugano’s Plan ₿ merchants.”\n\n\n \n         \n         \n         \n        A screenshot of the map posted.\n \n    \nPlan ₿ is a city initiative designed in collaboration with Tether to attract wealth, smart minds and opportunities. Part of this plan involved Lugano making bitcoin a de-facto legal tender, which was announced in March 2022.\n\n\n\nThis was followed by the announcement of the Plan ₿ Summer School, an educational opportunity for those looking to learn more about bitcoin and businesses, which took place in July 2022. The school featured expert speakers including the likes of Blockstream CEO Adam Back.\nMost recently, the Plan ₿ foundation partnered with GoCrypto to onboard multiple merchants to accept bitcoin, including McDonald’s and various art galleries. At that time, the foundation predicted it would serve over 2,500 customers using bitcoin by the end of the year. \nThe Plan ₿ foundation confirmed on Twitter today that visitors and residents alike can “pay with Bitcoin for food, drinks, art, fashion, jewelry, cars, watches, tattoos, real-estate, municipal taxes, and services and so much more…”\n\n\n\nAs the bitcoin ecosystem grows, various jurisdictions will continue to vie for the business of Bitcoiners and Bitcoin companies. This can be seen in examples like Lugano, as well as that of Madeira, Bitcoin Beach and several others. While bitcoin is still in its infancy, developments like these serve both as a testing battle ground and a way to push for greater adoption and improvements.",

The move saw prices hit their highest point since mid-December, and comes as market sentiment has shifted in a bullish direction. Cardano was also in the green, as it hit a one-week high today.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) rose for a sixth straight session on Wednesday, as market momentum remains bullish.\n \nSOL/USD surged to a high of $14.10 earlier in the day, less than a day after trading at a low of $11.83.\n \nToday’s rally saw the token climb to its highest point since December 15, when it last collided with a resistance level of $14.50.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, Wednesday’s surge comes as SOL moved beyond a ceiling of 53.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 59.79, which is its strongest point since Nov. 6.\n \nBulls in solana will likely continue to attempt a breakout of a ceiling at $14.50 in the coming days.\n \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nAnother notable gainer on Wednesday was cardano (ADA), which climbed to a one-week high earlier today.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.2505 on Tuesday, ADA/USD raced to a peak of $0.2668 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move saw the token collide with a long-term resistance level of $0.2660, hitting its highest level since December 27 in the process.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, this rally pushed the RSI to its own resistance of 47.00, which has resulted in earlier gains easing.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 46.75, with cardano trading at $0.2649 ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes for December.\n \nThe moving average of 10 days (red), and its 25-day (blue) counterpart have also neared in proximity, which could be catalyst for an upwards cross later in the week.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect cardano to break its current resistance level this week?
