          "description": "For the Bitcoin price, the course for the rest of January may have been set today. The question was: Will Bitcoin continue its mini-bull run or will there be a correction? This was decided by today’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) release in the US at 8:30 am EST.\n \nThe baseline was relatively clear. Most estimates agreed that 6.5% is the magic line that will decide whether it is a bull or bear market in the short term. If the figure is 6.3% or lower, there will be a bull run as the US central bank projections from the last FOMC are no longer credible and will be thrown overboard.\n \nAt 6.3% to 6.5%, the market is likely to celebrate with restraint, although this may already be priced in. At 6.5% to 7.1%, there will be a sell-off.\n \nAnd the estimates were spot on. The CPI came in at 6.5%\n \n \nJP…",

Ethereum also moved higher, climbing above $1,400 in the process.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) surged above $18,000 on Thursday, as markets prepared for a further drop in U.S. consumer prices.\n \nBTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $18,268.55 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $17,337.99.\n \nToday’s move saw bitcoin climb to its strongest point since December 14, when prices were at a peak of $18,385.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the rally took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to move deeper into overbought territory\n \nAs of writing, the index is now tracking at 75.98, which is its highest mark since October 2021.\n \nDepending on this afternoon’s inflation rate, there could be a reversal in BTC, as earlier momentum may have already peaked.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) was also significantly higher in today’s session, with prices moving to a two-month high.\n \nFollowing a low of $1,323.58 on Wednesday, ETH/USD jumped to a peak of $1,408.13 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of this rally, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency is now trading at its strongest position since November 8.\n \n \nLike with bitcoin earlier, the move has occurred as the RSI broke out of a ceiling at 69.00, and it is currently tracking at 75.89.\n \nIn addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has continued its upwards crossover versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nShould this momentum maintain this trajectory, then the next target for bulls will likely be a ceiling of $1,470.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect the inflation report to send cryptocurrencies even higher?
