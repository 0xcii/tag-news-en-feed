          "description": "Solana ended a two-day losing streak on Wednesday, as the token surged by as much as 7% in today’s session. The move came following a two-week low on Tuesday, as markets slipped after recent highs. XRP also edged higher, and currently hovers near a key price floor.\n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) recovered from a two-week low on Wednesday, as bulls took advantage of yesterday’s dip in price.\n \nAfter slipping to a bottom of $22.86 on Tuesday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $24.56 earlier in the day.\n \nThe token has mostly traded lower in recent weeks, after surging to an eight-month high above $30.00 on June 14.\n \n \nToday’s rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) bounced on a floor at the 52.00 mark.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 57.51, and looks set to be heading for a ceiling at 60.00.\n \nShould it reach this point, there is a strong possibility SOL will be above $25.00.\n \n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was trading close to a key support point during today’s session, as price continued to consolidate.\n \nXRP/USD peaked at $0.7141 earlier in today’s session, after slipping to an intraday low of $0.6961 the day prior.\n \nSince surging to $0.9479 earlier this month, XRP has mostly traded between a floor at $0.7000 and ceiling of $0.8200.\n \n \nFollowing a brief move below the aforementioned support point, XRP bulls have reentered to push the price higher.\n \nThis coincided with price strength finding a stable zone at 57.00, helping increase bullish prospects.\n \nThe next target to maintain today’s slight rebound will be to capture the $0.7500 resistance level.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould XRP move above $0.7500 before the end of July?
