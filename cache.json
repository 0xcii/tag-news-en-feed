          "description": "Roughly 11 days ago, it was reported that Nishad Singh, the former director of engineering at FTX, was working with federal prosecutors to arrange a plea deal. On Tuesday, Singh pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stated, “I am unbelievably sorry for my role in all of this.”\n \nSingh Cooperating With Authorities in FTX Investigation; Bankman-Fried Declines to Comment on Singh’s Guilty Plea\n \nFormer FTX director of engineering Nishad Singh pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, money laundering, and violating campaign finance laws in the United States, according to reports.\n \n“I am unbelievably sorry for my role in all of this,” Singh said in a New York court on Tuesday. During the hearing, Singh’s prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, explained that Singh flew back from the Bahamas to assist with the U.S. investigation after FTX collapsed.\n \nSingh stated that he knew around mid-2022 that Alameda Research was using customer funds, and he also pledged to forfeit the proceeds he obtained from the scheme. Reuters first reported the news, and following Singh’s plea, the publication contacted Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) for comment.\n \n \nAccording to the report, a spokesman for Bankman-Fried declined to comment. Singh’s plea comes after ex-Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang pleaded guilty. Ellison provided a detailed account that also acknowledged the use of customer funds in the FTX/Alameda scheme. Bankman-Fried faces 12 charges, including bank fraud, after four new charges were added to his initial indictment.\n \nWhat do you think this guilty plea means for the ongoing investigation into FTX and Alameda Research?
