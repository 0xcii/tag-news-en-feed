Addressing the burning issue, he stated, “It’s certainly a value getting these Hinman emails and these other things because they can perhaps expose the thought process the SEC has and you can definitely show that there was unequal application of law. That’s fine. But none of that activity presupposes corruption, just favoritism.”\n \nControversy Surrounding Hinman Docs\n \nRipple Labs thrust Hinman’s documents into the limelight this June after enduring a prolonged legal feud with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
