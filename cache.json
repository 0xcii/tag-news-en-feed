The chosen consortium, Fahrenheit, includes Arrington Capital, a blockchain-based venture capital firm. In addition to the consortium acquiring the company, a new board of directors, primarily appointed by creditors, will oversee the new company formed as a result of the purchase.\nCelsius also revealed that it has secured a backup bid from the Blockchain Recovery Investment Consortium (BRIC), a holding company affiliated with Gemini Trust, owned by the Winklevoss twins, ensuring an alternative option in case the deal with Fahrenheit falls through.\nAccording to Celsius, Fahrenheit will provide the necessary capital, management expertise, and technology to navigate the bankruptcy. The consortium's selection indicates a potential positive outcome for Celsius and its creditors, allowing the company to move forward under new management and ownership.",
