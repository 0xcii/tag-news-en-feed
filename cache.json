Litecoin also climbed, hitting a two-month high in the process.\n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nChainlink (LINK) rose to a six-month high on Tuesday, as the global crypto market cap rebounded from Monday’s decline.\n \nLINK/USD rallied to an intraday high of $8.66 in today’s session, a day after trading at a low of $7.97.\n \nToday’s surge in price saw chainlink climb to its highest point since November 8, when it traded at a peak of $9.48.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, one of the catalysts of today’s surge in price was a breakout that occurred on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAt the time of writing, price strength has moved beyond a ceiling at the 68.00 mark, and is now tracking at 72.93\n \nThis is the strongest reading for the index since February 2021, which could mean that a reversal is on the cards.\n \n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nIn addition to LINK, litecoin (LTC) also moved to a multi-month high during today’s session.\n \nFollowing a low of $98.11 to start the week, LTC/USD rose above the $100.00 mark, hitting a peak of $102.67 in the process.\n \nAs a result of Tuesday’s surge in price, litecoin has hit its highest point since February 16.\n \n \nThe move came as LTC saw a breakout of a long-term ceiling at the $101.00 level, before colliding with a wall on the RSI indicator.\n \nThis aforementioned ceiling was at the 67.00 mark, and as of writing the index is marginally higher, at a reading of 67.17.\n \nShould a full breakout occur, the next high that litecoin bulls must overcome is a ceiling at $105.70.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCan litecoin move above $105.00 in the coming week?
