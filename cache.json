Shibburn data puts the token burn figure for the last 24 hours at over 264.2 million, a notable jump from its previous day’s figures of 2.7 million.\n \n \nInterestingly, the 2.7 million figure which was recorded on Sunday amounted to a 5,000% surge in burn rate, suggesting renewed interest.

          "description": "On November 26, 2023, a stroke of remarkable luck befell a solo miner when they discovered block 818,588, verifying a total of 4,193 transactions. This achievement garnered the miner a total of 6.887 BTC, inclusive of the 6.25 BTC subsidy and transaction fees.\n \nSolo Miner’s Slim Odds Pay Off: Claims Bitcoin Block Reward With Mere 2 PH/s Hashrate\n \nEchoing a similar event from the end of October, this miner, also affiliated with Solo Ckpool, successfully mined the block. Ckpool is designed to support independent miners, allowing them to retain the entire block reward, unlike other pools where rewards are shared.\n \n \nCon Kolivas, the developer overseeing Solo Ckpool, remarked that this was the 279th block successfully mined by the pool. He noted the rarity of such an event, stating, “A miner of this size would solve a block on average only once every 5 years,” underscoring the miner’s extraordinary luck in this instance.\n \n \nFor context, the Bitcoin network’s total hashpower stands at approximately 488 exahash per second (EH/s), or 488 quintillion hashes per second. In comparison, the solo miner’s contribution of 2 PH/s, or 2 quadrillion hashes, represents a mere 0.0004% of the network’s collective hashpower, highlighting the improbability of their success.\n \nWhat do you think about the solo miner discovering a block with such a small amount of hashrate?

Stablecoins have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their potential to address some of the limitations of traditional cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is known for its price volatility, stablecoins provide a more price stable alternative, making them suitable for various use cases.\nOne of the most prominent ways stablecoins are marketed is in regards to their ability to act as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset space.

The “exchange whale ratio” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the sum of the top 10 transfers to exchanges and the total exchange inflow.\n \nThe ten largest deposits to exchanges generally come from whale entities, so this ratio’s value can tell us about how the inflow activity of these humongous investors compares against that of the entire market.\n \n \nWhen this metric is high, the whales comprise a significant part of the total exchange inflows.
