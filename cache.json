          "description": "The case against bankrupt crypto lender Celsius took a new turn as one of its former executives came forward. According to a report from Reuters, Roni Cohen-Pavon, ex-Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) at the company, pleaded guilty to criminal charges.\n \n \nCelsius Former Executive Pleads Guilty, What Are The Implications\n \nThe report indicates that Cohen-Pavon attended a hearing today, September 14th, with US District Judge John Koeltl. At the hearing, the former Celsius executive pleaded guilty to manipulating the price of a crypto token, CEL, and four other counts.\n \nCohen-Pavon is one of the Celsius executives under legal scrutiny due to its involvement with the collapse of the crypto lender. The former CRO at this company was charged with the founder and CEO, Alex Mashinsky, in July 2023.\n \nUnlike Cohen-Pavon, Mashinsky pleaded not guilty during his hearing. The former executive is expecting a sentence on December 11, 2024. It is unclear, but likely, that today’s events were motivated by an agreement.\n \nIn the US judicial system, individuals often plead guilty to certain charges when they reach a deal with US law enforcement in exchange for information that could help them get another conviction. The most likely target is Mashinsky.\n \nAs Bitcoinist reported, following Mashinsky’s arrest and not-guilty plea, the Celsius founder posted bail and now awaits trial. Just yesterday, the crypto founder tried to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n \nThe Celsius former CEO has been accused of co-mingling, using his clients’ assets for his gain, and running an alleged fraudulent scheme. Celsius’ case has been heavily linked to that of the failed crypto exchange FTX and the collapse of the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem during the worst part of the “Crypto Winter” in 2022.\n \n \nAs of this writing, the CEL token trades at $0.10 after a significant downside price action pushed it from its 2023 highs north of $0.7.\n \n \nCover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview",

          "description": "Tron was a big mover on Thursday, as recent reports suggest that the blockchain platform has been processing an average of 4.8 million daily transactions. The token has now surged higher for three consecutive sessions, and looks set to collide with a key resistance level. Solana was also in the green today.\n \nTron (TRX)\n \nTron (TRX) rose to a multi-week high on Thursday, on the back of reports claiming that the blockchain sees nearly 5 million daily transactions.\n \nTRX/USD peaked at $0.08322 earlier in the day, which comes following a low of $0.08043 the day before.\n \nAs a result of today’s gains, tron has now risen to its highest point since July 30, when price traded at a high of $0.08395.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that bulls are attempting to reach a ceiling at $0.08600, however a hurdle on the relative strength index (RSI) seems to be preventing this.\n \nPrice strength is currently tracking at 67.89, which is marginally below a ceiling at the 68.00 level.\n \nIn order for bulls to capture their price target, this aforementioned resistance point will need to be broken.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) rose for a third consecutive day on Thursday, as price moved closer to the coveted $20.00 mark.\n \nSOL/USD surged by as much as 5% in today’s session, hitting an intraday peak of $19.27 in the process.\n \nThis move comes a day after the world’s ninth largest cryptocurrency traded at a bottom of $17.96.\n \n \nEarlier gains in price have started to ease in the last few hours, after the RSI closed in on a ceiling of 43.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, it is at a reading of 41.05, with the token marginally below today’s high, sitting at $18.84.\n \nAlthough $20.00 is still clearly the short-term target, it will likely take a significant amount of bullish momentum to get there.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect solana to hit $20.00 in the coming days?
