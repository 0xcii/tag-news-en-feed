          "description": "A court in Turkey has sentenced Faruk Fatih Özer, the founder of the collapsed Turkish crypto exchange Thodex, his sister Serap Özer, and his brother Güven Özer to 11,196 years, ten months and 15 days in prison, according to Coindesk. Further, they are also facing a judicial penalty of 135 million liras (about $5 million).  \n\nThodex CEO Goes to Jail\nIt was part of an extensive trial of 21 defendants facing up to 40,564 years in prison. On its verdict on Thursday, the Anatolian 9th Heavy Penal Court acquitted 16 defendants and released another four due to lack of evidence. The rest faced varying sentencing depending on the charges against them.  \n\nThodex was the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Turkey. The exchange suddenly went offline in April 2021. Özer immediately went missing, but the authorities arrested his brother, sister, and four other senior employees and also detailed at least 83 other people.  \n\nThe exchange had around 400,000 clients when it shuttered, out of which 390,000 were actively trading cryptocurrencies. Before going offline, the exchange was handling crypto trading volumes of more than $585 million, according to CoinMarketCap.com data. It was estimated to be holding cryptocurrency deposits of about $2 billion.   \n\nSerious Charges against Thodex CEO  \n\nÖzer was later arrested in Albania in August 2022 after an Interpol red notice was issued against him. He was extradited to Turkey last April for seven charges, including creating and running a criminal organization, being part of a criminal organization, cheating by using information systems as a tool of banks or credit institutions, deceiving merchants or company executives and cooperative managers, and hiding the value of assets that come from crime.  \n\nHe was also sentenced to seven months and 15 days in prison in July for failing to submit certain documents demanded by the Turkish Tax Inspection Board, Finance Magnates earlier reported.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.",

The fintech’s CEO suggested that his company’s successful and profitable microfinance business partly influenced the decision to acquire the Mexican startup.\n \nAsaak’s Profitable Business\n \nThe Ugandan mobility fintech Asaak recently said it acquired car financing startup Flexclub Mexico for an undisclosed sum. According to one report, Asaak’s acquisition of the Mexican asset financing startup will potentially expose the Uganda-based startup firm to the Mexican microfinance market and the South African car rental market. Flexclub has reportedly pivoted away from the Mexican market.\n \nKaivan Sattar, the co-founder and CEO of the Ugandan fintech, suggested that his company’s successful and profitable microfinance business had partly influenced the decision to acquire the Mexican startup.\n \n\n \nAs explained in a Techcabal report, Asaak’s decision to acquire Flexclub Mexico might have been influenced by the fact that the same investor funds both startups.\n \n“As active investors in both Asaak and FlexClub, simple.Capital() spotted an opportunity to procure the acquisition of FlexClub’s Mexican business by Asaak. We congratulate both management teams on the closing of this transaction which we believe has significant benefits for both Asaak and FlexClub,” Blake Musgrove, partner and Chief Investment Officer at Simple.capital, reportedly said.\n \nMeanwhile, Tinashe Ruzane, the CEO and co-founder of Flexclub, said a decision to exit the Mexican market has enabled the startup to focus its efforts on the South African market.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
