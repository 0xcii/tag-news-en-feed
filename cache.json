XRP also dropped in today’s session, hitting a three-week low in the process.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) fell to a multi-month low to start the week, as markets slipped due to growing tensions in the Middle East.\n \nSHIB/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.000006894 on Monday, less than 24 hours after price peaked at $0.000007221.\n \nToday’s decline saw the meme coin fall to its weakest point since June 16, which is the last time the cryptocurrency slipped below a floor at $0.00000690.\n \n \nThe relative strength index (RSI) also dropped below a support point of its own at the 37.00 mark.\n \nCurrently, price strength is tracking at 34.90, and appears to be moving towards the 30.00 region.\n \nShould it drop below this point, SHIB will enter the oversold zone, which could then prompt bulls to potentially buy the dip.\n \n \nXRP\n \nXRP, formerly ripple, was another notable mover on Monday, falling by over 4% in today’s session.\n \nAfter reaching a high of $0.5218 on Sunday, XRP/USD plunged to a bottom at $0.4975 earlier in the day.\n \nThis resulted in the world’s fifth largest cryptocurrency moving to its weakest point since September 18.\n \n \nMonday’s move occurred as the RSI retreated towards a support level at the 43.00 mark for the first time in three weeks.\n \nAs of writing, the index is now at a reading of 43.60, with ripple trading at $0.5014, following a three-day losing streak.\n \nIn the event that the RSI falls under 43.00, XRP will likely edge below $0.5000 in the upcoming days.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect XRP bears to extend today’s losses?
