This collaboration facilitates instant withdrawals of crypto funds to debit cards in 145 countries, as highlighted by Transak’s announcement.\n \n“By enabling real-time card withdrawals through Visa Direct, Transak is delivering a faster, simpler and more connected experience for its users — making it easier to convert crypto balances into fiat, which can be spent at the more than 130M merchant locations where Visa is accepted,” the North America head of Visa Direct and Global Ecosystem Readiness, Yanilsa Gonzalez-Ore said.\n \nThe press announcement sent to Bitcoin.com News highlights that a key attribute of Visa Direct is its capability for immediate transaction processing. This translates to the possibility of money transfers being completed in nearly 30 minutes or less, marking a notable improvement compared to conventional banking practices, which often require several days.\n \n \n“Combining this with Transak’s robust infrastructure and support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, the collaboration welcomes a new dawn for those who want to quickly exit the crypto market,” the company emphasized. The partnership follows Visa’s announcement earlier this month that it will include Web3 elements in its customized loyalty program solution.\n \nWhat do you think about Transak’s and Visa’s partnership?
