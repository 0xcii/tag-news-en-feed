The investigation centered on alleged regulatory breaches and illicit activities within Binance. And now, the finale of this probe seems to have prompted a leadership transition.\nThe investigation's official outcome is happening today, as earlier this morning Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is announcing Binances' settlement later in the afternoon.
