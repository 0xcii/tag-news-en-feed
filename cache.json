The block, mined earlier today, contained 2,391 transactions, according to blockchain data.\n\nJUST IN: A solo miner just mined a block worth 3.275 #Bitcoin worth $199,098.\nLEGEND 🤯 pic.twitter.com/rqscP29dud\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 29, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nBitcoin mining is the process through which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation. It typically involves using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems, which verify and add transactions to the blockchain. In return, miners are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins, known as the block subsidy, along with transaction fees paid by users.\nThe miner’s accomplishment is significant, given the increasingly competitive landscape of Bitcoin mining, where large mining pools usually dominate. Solo miners face the challenge of competing against large, resource-rich mining pools; however, although rare, the rewards can be substantial, as demonstrated by this and many previous solo miners' successes.\n\"Congratulations to miner 36AisvWi1UiwLTeTZxLzindAkorqeUc3tT for solving the 291st solo block on solo.ckpool.org!\" said Solo CK administrator, Dr. Con Kolivas. \"This hefty miner with 38PH would solve a block on average once every ~4 months.\"\nThe achievement by this solo miner also serves as a reminder of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, where anyone with the right resources can contribute to and benefit from the network.",
