The Chumps FOMO [fear of missing out] buy the Pump only to puke out their purchases with the Dump.” Brandt opined:\n \n\nIt is the Hump…Slump…Pump…Dump that keeps a bull trend healthy. Let’s see if HSPD works its magic once again.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBrandt regularly provides analysis of bitcoin’s price. He has also made several bullish statements about the cryptocurrency. On Jan. 18, he wrote on X: “I have a macro bias in bitcoin in a very broad sense — that BTC is a best candidate to be a tremendous store of value against the destruction of fiat.” On Jan. 6, he wrote: “Bitcoin is primary a store-of-value IMO and still has massive opportunities to appreciate. I think everything is junk, including ETH.”\n \n\n \nHowever, the trader is skeptical about the impact of the Bitcoin halving on the price of BTC. On Dec. 21 last year, he explained on X: “The Bitcoin halving hype is a whole lot of excitement over nothing. Sure, halving hype might temporarily impact price. But the reduction of supply as % of daily volume is the size of a gnat’s ass.”\n \n\n \nWhat do you think about Peter Brandt’s bitcoin price analysis? Do you think a bitcoin bull run is coming soon?
