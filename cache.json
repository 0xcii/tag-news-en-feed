The extradition bids originate from both the United States and South Korea, with the final determination of Kwon’s destination resting in the hands of the court’s Justice Minister.\n \nJudge Will Decide on Do Kwon’s Extradition\n \nThe notorious Do Kwon is poised for extradition upon completing his sentence in Montenegro, though his ultimate destination remains uncertain. A recent press release reveals that South Korea seeks Kwon for engaging in fraudulent and unfair trading activities. Additionally, the U.S. also desires his extradition for similar infractions, including securities fraud and market manipulation.\n \nAccording to the press release, Kwon agreed to be extradited to South Korea. However, the court noted that due to multiple extradition requests, the Podgorica High Court must make the final determination. “The final decision on the matter will be made by the Minister of Justice of Montenegro,” the announcement specifies.\n \n \nThe announcement from the Podgorica High Court further clarifies, “If the Minister of Justice allows the final extradition of the aforementioned accused, the extradition will be executed after the completion of the criminal sentence imposed by the Basic Court in Podgorica in a case against the same individual for the criminal offense of document forgery.”\n \nWhat do you think about Do Kwon being extradited?

Every major bank you know or are a client of is centralized and, thus, controlled by a central authority.

Without intermediaries and by utilizing blockchain technology, transaction fees are reduced significantly, and you can transfer your funds without geographic restrictions. However, it doesn’t mean you can buy Bitcoin anonymously without effort. You still have to provide personal details due to financial regulations, even in the crypto world.
