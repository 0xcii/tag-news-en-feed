Traders were buoyed by the news, pushing the token to its highest level since April in the process. Stellar rose to a one-week high today.\n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nChainlink (LINK) was one of Thursday’s most notable gainers, as the token surged nearly 20% higher.\n \nAfter falling to a low of $6.88 on Wednesday, LINK/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $8.32 earlier in the day.\n \nThe move pushed price to its strongest point since last April, when the token hit a high above $8.60.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the latest rally took place as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of its ceiling at 72.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is at 73.03, with an upcoming resistance point of 77.00 a possible destination for bulls.\n \nIn the likely event it reaches this point, LINK could surpass last Thursday’s peak.\n \n \nStellar (XLM)\n \nIn addition to LINK, stellar (XLM) was another big mover during today’s session, as it also rose by nearly 20%\n \nXLM/USD recorded a high of $0.1793 earlier in the day, which comes following yesterday’s low of $0.1414.\n \nSimilar to chainlink, this peak pushed stellar to its highest point since last Thursday, when the token hit a then 15-month high.\n \n \nAs a result of this gain, price strength in XLM is now overbought, which could spell a soon end for the current uptrend.\n \nThe RSI is tracking at a reading of 71.87, but is fast approaching a resistance zone at the 73.00 mark.\n \nTraders may already be considering securing profits as price strength heads to this point.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould stellar bulls extend the rally in the coming days?

          "description": "In an announcement Thursday morning, the Federal Reserve announced that its instant payment system, the FedNow® Service, has officially gone live. This tool aims to empower banks and credit unions of all sizes to facilitate instantaneous money transfers for their customers. The Federal Reserve claims that FedNow transactions can be executed 24/7, 365 days a year.\nTo start, 35 banks and credit unions, alongside the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, are among those already equipped to handle payments through the FedNow Service. Furthermore, a lineup of 16 service providers are poised to offer payment processing support for banks and credit unions.\n\"The Federal Reserve built the FedNow Service to help make everyday payments over the coming years faster and more convenient,\" said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. \"Over time, as more banks choose to use this new tool, the benefits to individuals and businesses will include enabling a person to immediately receive a paycheck, or a company to instantly access funds when an invoice is paid.\"\nWhen asked if the FedNow service is attempting to replace cash, and if it was a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or not, the Federal Reserve stated \"No. The FedNow Service is not related to a digital currency. The FedNow Service is a payment service the Federal Reserve is making available for banks and credit unions to transfer funds for their customers. It is like other Federal Reserve payment services, such as Fedwire and FedACH. The FedNow Service is neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash.\"\nA comprehensive list of early adopters already equipped with instant payment capabilities can be found in an attached document. Further information can be found on the Federal Reserve Financial Services website.",

The move came as bitcoin also edged higher, after falling to a four-week low during Tuesday’s session. \n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) was marginally higher on Thursdays, as the cryptocurrency once again attempted to rebound from recent losses.\n \nFollowing a low of $29,794.27 on Wednesday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak of $30,406.45 earlier in the day.\n \nThe move came as bitcoiners continued to move away from Tuesday’s fall below $30,000, which resulted in BTC hitting a four-week low.\n \n \nPrice stabilized as the relative strength index (RSI) found a firm floor at the 49.00 mark. It has now surged to a current reading of 53.60.\n \nTraders are likely now targeting an upcoming ceiling at $30,800, which has historically been the last line of defense before entering the $31,000 zone.\n \nDespite this target, momentum still appears to be bearish, as a result of the recent downwards crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) rose back above $1,900 in today’s session, ending its own losing streak.\n \nETH/USD hit a high of $1,927.57 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after edging to a low of $1,883.07.\n \nMomentum has been largely bearish in the world’s second largest cryptocurrency in recent days, following last week’s rally.\n \n \nToday’s move is the first day since last Thursday that ethereum has traded in the green, with traders still optimistic about future surges above $2,000.\n \nA ceiling at $1,960 will likely be the main test for ethereum’s bull strength, and should it pass this level, it is highly likely the price will reach $2,000.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat fundamentals are behind today’s price rebound?
