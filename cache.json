He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

          "description": "Cybercriminals have reportedly breached AT&T email accounts and are using the access gained to steal crypto assets from their victims. While a spokesperson for AT&T has denied claims that hackers have gained access to the company’s internal systems, a report suggests that as much as $20 million worth of crypto may have been stolen.\n \nCriminals ‘Used an API Access’\n \nCybercriminals have reportedly gained access to AT&T email accounts and are using this to hack into targeted victims’ crypto exchange accounts. According to a Techcrunch report, the criminals using this modus operandi may have stolen crypto assets worth between $15 million and $20 million.\n \nAlthough two victims are said to have confirmed the theft, a spokesperson for AT&T has in the meantime rejected suggestions that criminals have gained access to the company’s internal systems.\n \n“There was no intrusion into any system for this exploit. The bad actors used an API access,” said Jim Kimberly, the spokesperson for AT&T.\n \n\n \nAs explained in the Techcrunch report, unknown parties are thought to have found a way of hacking into personal AT&T email accounts that use att.net, sbcglobal.net, and bellsouth.net addresses. To achieve this, the hackers reportedly use access to the telecommunication company’s internal network which then enables them to create mail keys for any user.\n \nHaving gained a targeted person’s keys, the criminals are then able to login and reset the victim’s passwords including those on crypto exchange apps. To prove that cybercriminals have indeed gained access to AT&T’s internal systems, a whistleblower is said to have shared a list of the hackers’ alleged victims.\n \nWhile AT&T has acknowledged the “unauthorized creation of secure mail keys,” the spokesperson insisted that the company had responded to this by updating its security controls. The company said it has locked some email accounts to force the owners to reset passwords.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",

Banks are failing, our currency is crashing, and the dollar will soon no longer be the world standard, which will be our greatest defeat in over 200 years.\n \n“Joe Biden has led us to the very brink of World War III,” Trump continued. However, he clarified: “I’m not predicting World War III but I will say this, we are very close.” He then promised that if he’s elected president in 2024, “we will prevent World War III from happening.”\n \nTrump recently warned that China is trying to displace the U.S. dollar as the number one currency throughout the world. He also cautioned that the USD losing its world’s reserve currency status is like America “losing a world war,” emphasizing: “We’ll be a second-tier country.”\n \nThis week, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, also urged all countries to make efforts to avoid the outbreak of a new, full-scale global conflict. “We all need to work to ensure that this threat of global confrontation, of a hot, full-scale World War III should not materialize,” the Russian official said.\n \nWhat do you think about the statements by Donald Trump? Let us know in the comments section below.",
