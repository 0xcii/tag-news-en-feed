The event, only available during the conference, aims to turn it into a proving ground for Fedi Alpha, with attendees serving as test pilots.\nFedi co-founder and CEO, Obi Nwosu, expressed the importance of involving the Bitcoin community in shaping Fedi: \"We’re building Fedi with you ... It’s about turning BTC Prague into a proving ground, and all of the attendees into the test pilots of Fedi Alpha.\"\nParticipants can download a limited version of Fedi Alpha to join the Prague Pop-Up Federation, enabling them to receive live updates from the conference, engage in secure chats and send/receive sats to fellow attendees. The project showcases Fedi's vision of a federated operating system that empowers individuals and communities to regain control over their money and data.\nBTC Prague Organizer, Martin Kuchar, highlighted the project's ambition and expressed support for its success, stating, \"The project is as ambitious as it is exciting, and we are rooting hard for its success.\"\nFedi encourages participants to approach the event as a test and provide feedback to help improve the platform. The pop-up serves as a testament to the collaborative spirit of the Bitcoin community and its commitment to building a decentralized future.",

The move comes as traders continue to worry about what the recent Binance and Coinbase lawsuits could mean for the wider market.
