          "description": "Over the past decade, Coinbase has reached millions of cryptocurrency traders and expanded to become the largest crypto exchange in the US. Despite its solid reputation, Coinbase did not avert scrutiny and skepticism. It has intensified in the past two years, driven by the sharp upsurge and plunge in crypto prices in a short period. But what has become the hot topic was the sudden collapse of FTX, the former largest crypto exchange worldwide. \nNonetheless, it remains an influential figure in the market. True believers regard cryptocurrencies despite not being a sure inflation hedge. Bitcoin’s inverse correlation with inflation showed how much macroeconomic indicators could affect crypto prices.

          "description": "The High Court of  \nPodgorica has approved the extradition of Do Kwon, the Co-Founder and Former  \nCEO of Terraforms Labs, to the US.  Kwon  \nfaces multiple criminal counts in the US following the collapse of Terraform  \nLabs. \nAfter rejecting South  \nKorea's extradition plea, the Podgorica High Court deliberated over Do Kwon's  \nfate following a directive from the Court of Appeal, Pobjeda reported. Earlier rulings had  \nindicated conditions favoring Do Kwon's extradition, leaving the final decision  \nin the hands of Justice Minister Andrej Milović.\nHowever, the Court of  \nAppeal clarified that Do Kwon, having consented to expedited extradition  \nproceedings, would be subject to the jurisdiction of the requesting countries. \nLegal Arguments and  \nPolitical Dimensions\nDo Kwon's defense  \nattorney, Goran Rodić, emphasized legal provisions favoring extradition to  \nSouth Korea, citing international agreements and Montenegrin laws. Rodić  \ncontended that prevailing legal frameworks pointed towards South Korea as the  \nappropriate jurisdiction for Do Kwon's extradition.\nHowever, Justice  \nMinister Andrej Milović framed the decision as politically significant,  \nhighlighting the USA's status as a key diplomatic ally. Milović underscored  \nefforts to establish a bilateral extradition agreement, signaling Montenegro's  \ncommitment to bolstering international legal cooperation.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.",
