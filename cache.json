In addition, he stressed that on his first day as president, “CBDC goes into the trash can. We’re not going to allow it.”\n \nRon DeSantis’ Promises on Bitcoin, Crypto, Central Bank Digital Currency\n \nFlorida Governor and U.S. presidential candidate Ron DeSantis made several promises regarding bitcoin and cryptocurrency during his speech Monday at a campaign rally in New Hampshire.\n \n“We are going to let Americans invest in things like bitcoin and cryptocurrency. No one’s forcing you to do it. If you want to do it you can do it,” DeSantis emphasized, adding:\n \n\nBiden’s war on bitcoin and cryptocurrency will come to an end when I become president.\n \nDeSantis also reiterated his promise to stop the Fed from launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC). “We also will reject the Federal Reserve’s attempt to impose a central bank digital currency on the American people,” the presidential hopeful emphasized, elaborating:\n \n\nAs president, on day one, CBDC goes into the trash can. We’re not going to allow it.\n \n \nNoting that the Fed wants to “go to a cashless society,” DeSantis opined: “They want to eliminate cryptocurrency and they want all the transactions to go through this central bank digital currency.” He noted that he recently signed legislation in Florida where “we don’t recognize central bank digital currency.” The Florida governor has repeatedly said that “CBDC is a massive threat to American liberty.”\n \nDeSantis has also promised to protect the right to use bitcoin. He said in May: “You have every right to do bitcoin, the only reason bureaucrats in DC don’t like bitcoin is that they can’t control it. As president, we’ll protect your right to use bitcoin.”\n \nWhat do you think about Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ promises regarding bitcoin, crypto, and CBDC?
