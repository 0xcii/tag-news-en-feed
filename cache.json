The company is producing a hard limit of 30,000 units, mirroring the hard money scarcity of bitcoin.\n \n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \n“We believe the future is bright for Bitcoin, and that is one of the main reasons we pursued this project,” said Chris Coradini, owner of ProSnacktive Sales LLC. “It’s a fun way to promote Bitcoin and leave a long-lasting impression with all crypto, collectible, and candy enthusiasts alike! And yes, bitcoin was used to help fund this project!”\nWhile the markets are suffering a downturn and news of acquisitions, liquidation events and volatile prices crowd investors’ screens, ProSnacktive intends for this product to be a well-deserved break from the market madness.\nThe company noted that while these PEZ dispensers might not need to be HODLed quite as tightly as one’s bitcoin, they still might be worth holding onto as a collectible. One local Connecticut resident and PEZ collector is already excited for the product launch. \n“It’s awesome to hear that Bitcoin was adopted as a custom PEZ design,” local Connecticut resident Phil Grimaldi said. “I’m definitely going to be buying more Bitcoin before the dispenser goes on sale. I hope I am lucky enough to get one. PEZ and Bitcoin to the moon!",
