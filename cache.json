Paxos is in contact with the miner to recoup the funds.”\nIn a surprising turn of events, PayPal, the global online payments giant, reportedly overpaid a staggering $510,750 on a Bitcoin transaction fee. The incident, initially thought to be a \"fat-fingered\" mistake, has now been traced back to an issue within PayPal's processing system, according to a report by Mempool's Mononautical.
