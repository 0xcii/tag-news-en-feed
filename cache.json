The announcement details:\n \n\nThis is the most extensive seizure of bitcoins by law enforcement authorities in the Federal Republic of Germany to date.\n \n“The bitcoins were seized after the accused voluntarily transferred them to official wallets provided by the BKA [Federal Criminal Police Office],” the police detailed. “This means that a final decision has not yet been made about the utilization of the bitcoins,” they added. At the time of writing, the seized BTC is worth $2.13 billion.\n \n \nThis case involves a 40-year-old German male programmer and his business partner in an ongoing investigation into suspected unauthorized commercial exploitation of copyrighted works and subsequent money laundering.\n \nThe German programmer is accused of operating movie2k.io, which was once Germany’s most successful illegal video-sharing site. The authorities shut the site down in 2013. According to the police, the accused took the profits from the site and invested in bitcoin. He was arrested in 2019. Ten months after his arrest, he relinquished some of his bitcoin, transferring his BTC worth 25 million euros to the authorities.\n \nThe Saxony police’s announcement states that no further information will be provided until the investigation is completed.\n \nWhat do you think about German authorities seizing 50,000 bitcoins?

And people won’t want dollars anymore.”\n \nTim Draper on Government and Bitcoin\n \nBillionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper discussed his bitcoin outlook in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday. Draper is famous for his $250,000 bitcoin price prediction. When the price of BTC was $400, he predicted that it would take four years for it to reach $250K. Draper admitted that his prediction missed the mark because he underestimated several crucial factors.\n \n“A few things I didn’t expect. I didn’t expect the U.S. government to be so paranoid about it [bitcoin]. I expected the U.S. government to figure out how to tax it and figure out how to allow people to do business with bitcoin as their base currency. And it’s happened in a number of other countries, and that’s why bitcoin is doing so well … So I miscalculated on how … scared the government, the U.S. government was,” Draper detailed, emphasizing:\n \n\nAnd now, they realize that bitcoin’s actually better for everyone.\n \n“It keeps perfect records,” he elaborated, noting that criminals who used bitcoin “were all caught, so using dollars is probably better for a criminal.”\n \n \nDraper further shared: “I think that there’s going to be a moment where there’s a run on the banks the way after the Civil War there was a run on Confederate money, and there was a run on the Greek drachma and a run on the French franc when they became a part of the euro.” In conclusion, the billionaire investor opined:\n \n\nI actually think that there will be a moment in time when I can buy my food, clothing, and shelter all in bitcoin. And people won’t want dollars anymore.\n \nDo you agree with Tim Draper about bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.",
