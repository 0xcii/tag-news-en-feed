          "description": "Ripple Labs has formally opposed the US Securities and  \nExchange Commission’s (SEC) proposition to levy a substantial fine of nearly $2  \nbillion against the company linked to the XRP Ledger blockchain. Filed yesterday  \n(Monday), Ripple's opposition challenges the SEC's proposal, which seeks to  \npersuade a New York judge to impose the hefty penalty.\nLegal Battle Between Ripple and SEC\nThe SEC's proposal outlines a fine totalling $1.95 billion,  \ncomprising $876 million for disgorgement, $198 million for prejudgment  \ninterest, and a civil penalty of $876 million. The basis for the SEC's case  \nstems from allegations that Ripple Labs violated federal securities laws  \nthrough its institutional sales of XRP. Notably, the court ruled in favour of  \nRipple on some fronts, dismissing parallel claims by the SEC regarding the  \nlegality of XRP sales on exchanges and through algorithms.\nRipple's opposition document includes a redacted paragraph  \nconcerning its revenue from institutional sales, the income taxes it paid, and  \nits incurred losses. Within this segment, Ripple asserts that it had no gains  \nto disgorge, positioning it as a crucial argument in its defence against the  \nSEC's proposed penalties.\n“The Court should deny the SEC’s requests for an injunction,  \nfor disgorgement, and for pre-judgment interest, and should impose a civil  \npenalty of no more than $10 million,” the filing said.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Tareq Sikder at www.financemagnates.com.",
