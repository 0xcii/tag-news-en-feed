If approved, MATIC will be replaced with the new token that will function on all Polygon networks. Litecoin also rallied, hitting a one-month high.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) jumped to a multi-week high on Thursday, as traders reacted to the news that some of the project’s founders have proposed replacing the network’s MATIC token.\n \nIf successful, POL will be the new official token of Polygon, and this news has been boosting the price of MATIC/USD to a peak of $0.7668 today.\n \nAs a result of this, MATIC moved to its highest point since June 9, when price reached a high at $0.7890.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the surge in price came after the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 60.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 62.34, with the next visible point of resistance at the 70.00 level.\n \nIn the event this ceiling is hit, MATIC will likely be trading above $0.8000.\n \n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nLitecoin (LTC) also surged higher in today’s session, as traders pushed price above the $100.00 mark.\n \nFollowing a low of $94.79 on Wednesday, LTC/USD raced to an intraday peak at $101.45 earlier in the day.\n \nOverall, this is the strongest level the token has hit since last Thursday, when it peaked at $105.95.\n \n \nThe jump comes after bulls rebounded following a breakout below a support point at $95.00, with the RSI hitting a floor of its own at 53.00.\n \nCurrently, price strength is at a reading of 57.88, with LTC continuing to record higher highs as the day progresses.\n \nA ceiling of $102.00 is now the obvious target, and should the price push past this point, there is a good chance LTC hits $105.00 in the coming days.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect momentum in litecoin to remain bullish in the coming days?

Market volatility has risen following yesterday’s U.S. inflation report, which dropped to a two-year low. Ethereum was marginally lower, slipping below $1,900.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) consolidated below the $31,000 level in today’s session, as traders continued to digest the latest inflation report.\n \nBTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $30,228.84 earlier in today’s session, a day after peaking at $30,959.97.\n \nThe drop came as bulls were unable to sustain a breakout above a key resistance level at the $30,800 zone.\n \n \nFrom the chart, this coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failing to break out of its own ceiling at 61.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 59.30, with a floor of 55.00 a possible target should momentum continue to slip.\n \nShould this occur, there is a good chance that bitcoin will move below $30,000.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nAfter a brief stint above $1,900, ethereum (ETH) also moved lower on Thursday, with a moving average crossover close to occurring.\n \nFollowing a high of $1,901.15 on Wednesday, ETH/USD fell to a bottom at $1,864.50 earlier in today’s session.\n \nSimilar to BTC, this drop came as ethereum fell below a recent resistance level of $1,890, and towards a floor at $1,850.\n \n \nOne of the reasons for this was due to the RSI failing to move past a ceiling at 53.00. It is currently hovering at 52.56.\n \nOverall, momentum seems to be bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average likely to race past the 25-day (blue) trend line momentarily.\n \nIn the event this takes place, bears could target exits at $1,795.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill ethereum end the week above $1,800?
