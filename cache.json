The TLDR, however, is the overall impact will be minimal to investors, relatively meaningful to the issuers and it reflects poorly on the SEC overall.\nIn order to provide context, it is important to describe the basic structure of Exchange Traded Funds.

During this period, there was an influx of  \n$243 million into digital asset ETPs, underlining the heightened investor  \ninterest in cryptocurrencies.\nBitcoin emerged as the frontrunner in these  \ninvestments, capturing the largest share of $1.9 billion in inflows,  \nrepresenting a remarkable 87% of the total $2.2 billion. This dominance,  \nunprecedented in the crypto investment landscape, marked a significant shift,  \nsurpassing the previous high of 80% in 2020.\n\nThe final week of 2023 saw US$243m of inflows into digital asset ETPs, bringing 2023 total flows to US$2.2bn. pic.twitter.com/EtdHQWlu2K\n— James Butterfill (@jbutterfill) January 3, 2024\nThe price rally of Bitcoin through the year  \ncontributed substantially to this surge, witnessing a notable 155% climb and  \nconcluding 2023 at an impressive $42,000.\nWhile Bitcoin led the charge, Solana (SOL) also  \nshowcased a robust performance in 2023, garnering $167 million in net inflows.  \nEthereum (ETH), however, lagged with a comparatively modest $78 million  \nin the same period.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.",
