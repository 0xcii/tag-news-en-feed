We distinguish between \"n-of-n\" multi-signatures, where the number of involved parties is n, and they all need to approve, and \"t-of-n\" threshold signatures, where only a smaller number t of participants need to approve. Cryptographic schemes like MuSig, MuSig-DN and MuSig2 for multi-signatures and FROST by Komlo and Goldberg for threshold signatures can reduce transaction cost and improve privacy of multisig wallets.\nSo far, in the Bitcoin Community FROST has only been used in experimental implementations.
