Worldcoin representatives are said to be “working directly with regulators to meet Kenya’s requirements.”\n \nWorldcoin to Restart Kenyan Iris Scanning in Early 2024\n \nAccording to a report, Worldcoin representatives may have reached an agreement with Kenyan authorities which allows the iris biometric cryptocurrency project to resume operations under new guidelines. The report, which cites unnamed sources, said this is likely to happen sometime in early 2024.\n \nThe claim that Worldcoin is set to resume distributing its WLD tokens to users who agree to have their eyeballs scanned comes just a few months after Kenyan authorities suspended such activities. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, Kenyan regulators were adamant that Worldcoin did not have the necessary license to carry out its activities in the East African country.\n \n \nFollowing the suspension, Worldcoin representatives visited Kenya where they made an appearance before the country’s legislative body. However, according to a Citizen Digital report, Worldcoin may have satisfied concerns initially raised by regulators.\n \n“Worldcoin is working directly with regulators to meet Kenya’s requirements, particularly as the Assembly considers new regulations. Stipends will remain and will expand to locations across the country,” the unnamed source reportedly said.\n \nThe report, however, did not reveal when the Kenyan parliament is expected to pass new data regulations which will guide entities like Worldcoin.\n \nRegister your email here to get a weekly update on African news sent to your inbox:\n \n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

As of Dec. 16, 2023, a record-breaking amount was remunerated to miners for Ordinal inscriptions in a single day. Data indicates that on this Saturday, miners received over 235 BTC, marking it the third-highest day in terms of BTC volume, according to Dune Analytics metrics.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nYet, this day stood out as the most substantial in the U.S. dollar value of these fees, with miners earning $9.97 million in the 24-hour timeframe. This surpasses the prior peak on May 8, 2023, when miners were compensated $7.21 million for inscription confirmations.

From the 48.75 million inscriptions created since Dec. 16, 2022, miners have garnered over 4,084 BTC, equivalent to $170.68 million, for confirming these transactions. On that same day, bitcoin miners processed 638,144 transactions, with 392,574 being inscription-related.
