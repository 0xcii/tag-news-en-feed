This decrease was primarily attributed to the severe cold in Texas, leading many miners to pause their operations temporarily.

According to a local news report, the government has met the conditions for the men’s extradition set by the Tallinn Circuit Court. \n \nThe Estonian Ministry of Justice Has Collected Sufficient Evidence as Demanded by the Court\n \nThe Estonian government has approved the extradition of two founders of the crypto mining platform Hashflare, who are accused of operating a Ponzi scheme that fleeced $575 million from unsuspecting investors.\n \nIvan Turogin and Sergei Potapenko were arrested in Estonia’s capital Tallinn in November 2022, in a joint operation by the Estonian police and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). They face 18 counts of fraud and money laundering charges.\n \nAccording to a Post Timees report, Tallinn Circuit Court initially blocked the attempt to extradite the duo because the Estonian government had failed to probe the conditions of the place where Turogin and Potapenko were to be held, among other things. However, the Estonian government through the Ministry of Justice has said it has gathered enough evidence as per the court ruling.\n \n \nThe Estonian government now believes it has satisfied the conditions set by the court, and the men’s extradition to the U.S. would be above board. Described as one of Estonia’s high-profile fraud cases, Turogin and Potapenko’s Ponzi scheme reportedly took money from hundreds of thousands of Estonian and non-Estonian investors who were promised high returns on their investments.\n \nAfter their arrest, a U.S. attorney suggested that Turogin and Potapenko had used the allure of cryptocurrency mining to dupe people into investing.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

          "description": "A survey of European Central Bank (ECB) staff has revealed widespread dissatisfaction with President Christine Lagarde’s leadership. More than half of the respondents rated Lagarde’s performance as “very poor” or “poor.” Some expressed concerns that the former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief “does not necessarily act according to the values she proclaims.”\n \nLagarde Spends ‘Too Much Time on Topics Unrelated to Monetary Policy’\n \nThe International and European Public Services Organisation (IPSO), a union founded by European Central Bank (ECB) staff, conducted a survey among ECB staff asking them to assess the performance of Christine Lagarde as a president of the ECB.

          "description": "In a move towards a more diversified Ethereum execution client ecosystem, AllNodes, a staking provider, has announced its complete transition from Geth to Besu. With this shift, AllNodes has eliminated the use of Geth across its entire network of 23,895 nodes, marking a milestone in the ongoing efforts to reduce the current centralization around Geth, a majority client.\n \nAllNodes Migrates To Besu\n \nIn a post on X, the non-custodial staking provider said the decision is a testament to the growing recognition of the need for a more robust and decentralized Ethereum ecosystem. Though Geth is the most widely used execution client for Ethereum nodes, analysts are concerned about its dominance and potential security vulnerabilities should it fall prey to a bug.\n \n \nThe transition to Besu aligns…",
