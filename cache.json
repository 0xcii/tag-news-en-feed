He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

          "description": "According to regulations published by the country’s treasury secretary, global crypto exchanges used by Kenya’s estimated 4 million users will start paying a 1.5% tax on revenues earned. \n \nTax-Avoiding Digital Asset Platforms\n \nThe Kenyan Treasury has said it will start levying taxes on revenues earned by cryptocurrency exchanges used by an estimated 4 million local residents. According to a report by Business Daily Africa, Kenyan authorities will rely on the 1.5% digital tax service that became effective on Jan.1, 2021.\n \nInitially proposed in 2020, the digital tax is the Kenyan government’s attempt to extract revenue from leading crypto exchanges and tax-avoiding digital asset platforms. As reported by Bitcoin.com News in early January 2021, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) said it expected to get $45.5 million (5 billion Kenyan shillings) from the tax.\n \nMeanwhile, as shown in the 2023 regulations’ value added tax (electronic, internet and digital marketplace supply) published by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung’u, Kenya can now target global crypto exchanges.\n \n“For the purposes of these Regulations, a taxable electronic, Internet or digital marketplace supply include…facilitation of online payment for, exchange or transfer of digital assets excluding services exempted under the Act,” the published regulations state.\n \n\n \nAlongside Nigeria and South Africa, Kenya has one of Africa’s highest proportions of the population owning crypto. However, like its peers on the continent, Kenya has not recognized cryptocurrencies. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and its governor have warned residents against dealing with crypto assets like bitcoin.\n \nDespite the warnings, Kenyan residents continue to acquire and trade cryptocurrencies and this has prompted the government to seek ways to levy taxes on crypto transactions.\n \nRegister your email here to get a weekly update on African news sent to your inbox:\n \n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
