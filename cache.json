          "description": "Dogecoin mining profitability is actually higher than that of bitcoin, according to data from the mining calculator website CoinWarz. With the market seeing declines over the past year, the mining industry has taken a hit when it comes to its profitability. This is evidenced by multiple miners going bankrupt while others continue to struggle to keep the lights on. With prices so low, it looks like it is more profitable to mine the meme coin than the OG bitcoin.\n \nDogecoin’s Profitability Is 480% Higher Than Bitcoin\n \nThe mining profitability chart from CoinWarz shows that while the mining profitability has stayed mostly flat for bitcoin over the last 14 days, Dogecoin has been seeing a rise. This is also in spite of Dogecoin miners recording higher electricity rates compared to bitcoin.\n \n…",

          "description": "The mining company confirmed the operation is still shuttered after contractual disagreements with their power provider, Validus Power.\nHut 8’s bitcoin mining operation in North Bay, Ontario has come to a standstill after a set of unresolved disagreements in regards to their power contract with its Canadian-based energy provider, Validus Power. \nPreviously, Hut 8 notified the public of problems with Validus in November 2022, as the firm reported in its Q3 operations update that it had issued a notice of default to Validus for “failing to hit certain operational milestones.” Mining at the facility site was completely halted two weeks after this, as Validus stopped supplying power to the facility while delivering its own default notice for payments that Hut 8 failed to make. \nThe mining company’s Q3 report also stated that “Validus has also demanded that the Company make payments for delivery of energy that are higher than those negotiated under the terms of the PPA.” \nFluctuating power costs can have a major impact on bitcoin mining operations, and favorable power purchasing agreements are an integral part of a sustainable firm. According to their most recent December update, the company is “continuing to explore alternatives to mitigate the impact of the dispute with the third-party energy supplier to the site, including through organic and inorganic growth opportunities.” \nHut 8 has indicated that it fully intends to resolve the issues and restart operations as soon as possible, whether that be through a resolution involving Validus, or, as the company indicated, a potential alternative power supplier.",

          "description": "Amongst other updates designed to make new users’ experience easier, a new software update enables wallet funding directly through the application.\nFountain Podcasts, a Lightning-enabled podcast app designed to facilitate value for value transactions, has introduced their 0.6.0 update with many features oriented towards capturing new value for value users. \nIn a blog post, Fountain highlighted the new ability to fund your Fountain account via a partnership with MoonPay. Through this partnership, users can now use a debit card or credit card to purchase satoshis which arrive in the app’s wallet shortly thereafter.\nThe update also brings the arrival of the activity page, a feed which shows popular episodes and clips. The release describes how, “This is just the first of many new social discovery features we will be adding to Fountain that use money as a signal for value.” \nIn addition to these larger updates, several UI changes were implemented, including a new content card design, the ability to reply to clips, clips and comments being displayed on the episode pages under Activity and more. \nThrough the Fountain app, podcasters can receive sats for the content they provide, while listeners can receive sats for likes on their comments or clips. Streaming your favorite podcaster sats on a minute-by-minute basis provides a direct link between the consumer and the content creator, and is a way to empower these creators using Lightning. \nBy facilitating this value for value model, podcasters can avoid external sources of funding. In many industries, but especially in the Bitcoin industry, these external sources can introduce conflicts of interest which can potentially even prove harmful to consumers who trust their favorite podcasters. With software like Fountain, these consumers can directly support these podcasters and reduce the potential for such events.",
