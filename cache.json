The event organizers expect around 5,000 attendees at this year's conference, making it one of the larger Bitcoin conferences of the year.\nMichael Cruz, Mining Disrupt founder and co-owner, reflected on how far the conference has come in the last few years: “What started as the Mining Disrupt telegram group for miners over 6 years ago, turned in to our first official trade show in 2019, and now, we are thrilled to be celebrating our 5th year anniversary. What an amazing ride! We are very thankful for all the support.”\nGabriel Rodriguez, co-owner of Mining Disrupt, emphasizes the essence of the event as a true B2B Expo and conference, uniting leading companies in Bitcoin mining from around the globe under one roof. With over 100 sponsors and exhibitors, their shared goals revolve around building trust and fostering the growth of the young mining industry.\nThose who wish to learn more about this two day, three night event can read more on their website here.",
