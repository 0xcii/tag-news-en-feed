He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

          "description": "Recent local reports have brought to light that Shin Hyun-seong, also known as Daniel Shin, co-founder of Terraform Labs, has been indicted by the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office on charges of fraud. Along with nine others, Shin is suspected of deceiving investors and accumulating around 460 billion won ($350M) before the Terra project ultimately failed.\n \nDaniel Shin Indicted With 9 Other Terra Associates\n \nKBS World, a regional South Korean publication, has revealed that ten individuals, including Daniel Shin, have been indicted in South Korea. Although they have not been detained, the suspects have been charged with financial law violations, embezzlement, and fraud. The South Korean authorities suspect that this group of individuals raised 460 billion won ($350M) through unlawful means linked to the Terra blockchain project.\n \nAccording to the KBS report, Shin was responsible for supervising terrausd (UST) (now known as USTC) payments for four years, starting from July 2018. Prosecutors have reason to believe that false advertising was utilized during this period. Seven of the ten suspects who were indicted worked for Terraform Labs, while one was Shin’s financial broker. Although the prosecution is aiming to seize 246.8 billion won ($184.7M), the process has been far from smooth.\n \n \nIn a recent ruling, the court in Seoul stated that the original Terra asset, now referred to as LUNC, is not a security. As a result, the Seoul prosecutors’ office had difficulty confiscating Daniel Shin’s cryptocurrency assets due to this provision. After eleven months of investigations, the Seoul prosecutors’ office is now bringing the accused to trial. Notably, the indictment report does not mention co-founder Kwon Do-hyeong, commonly known as Do Kwon.\n \nWhat do you think about Daniel Shin being indicted by the Seoul prosecutors’ office?

The price plunged as consumer confidence in the United States fell by more than expected, coming in at a reading of 101.3 in April. Solana also slipped, hitting a two-week low.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) dropped to a six-week low on Tuesday, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remained bearish.\n \nMATIC/USD dropped for a third straight session, hitting an intraday low of $0.9633 in the process.\n \nThe move came less than a day after polygon was trading at a peak of $1.01, with today’s fall sending it to its weakest point since March 10.\n \n \nAs a result of the sell-off, it appears that MATIC bears are targeting a floor at the $0.95 mark.\n \nFrom the chart, one of the catalysts for the drop seems to be a breakout that occurred on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nThe index fell below a floor at 32.00, and is currently tracking at 31.13, which is its lowest reading since last June.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) was another notable mover on Tuesday, as the token moved closer to a floor at $20.00.\n \nFollowing a high of $21.95 to start the week, SOL/USD dropped to a low of $20.92 earlier in today’s session.\n \nToday’s slippage sent solana to its lowest level since April 11, when price fell to a bottom at $20.83.\n \n \nAt the time of writing, SOL has somewhat risen from its earlier low, and is currently trading at $20.95.\n \nIn addition to this, the RSI indicator continues to track near a floor at 42.00, with a present reading of 42.66.\n \nShould it fall below this point of support, it is highly likely that solana will drop below $20.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill solana begin May trading below $20.00?
