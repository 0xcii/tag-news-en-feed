          "description": "Polygon has extended recent gains, with prices climbing to a fresh ten-month high during Friday’s session. The token has now risen for a fourth consecutive session, and is up 13% from the same time last week. Polkadot also rallied on Friday, colliding with a key resistance level in the process. \n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) rose for a fourth consecutive session on Friday, pushing prices to a fresh ten-month high.\n \nFollowing a low of $1.36 on Thursday, MATIC/USD rallied to an intraday high of $1.48 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move pushed polygon to its strongest point since April 22, when prices were at a peak of $1.50.\n \nOverall, this latest rally comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) raced past a higher ceiling at 70.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 73.23, which is its highest reading since late January.\n \nShould momentum continue in this direction, there is a good chance that MATIC could move back above $1.50.\n \nPolkadot (DOT)\n \nPolkadot (DOT) also surged in today’s session, as prices ran into a key resistance level earlier in the day.\n \nDOT/USD hit a peak of $6.80 on Friday, which comes less than 24 hours after it traded at a floor of $6.31.\n \nThis resulted in polkadot breaking out of a long-term resistance point at the $6.75 mark, four days after trading at support of $6.15.\n \nA major contributor to the move was the fact that the RSI moved beyond a ceiling at 58.00, and it is currently tracking at 59.02.\n \nDOT bulls likely have a target of $7.00 in the coming days, with an upcoming resistance of 62.00 on the index a possible banana skin.\n \nAs of writing, polkadot is up almost 9% from the same point last week.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould polkadot move above $7.00 this weekend?
