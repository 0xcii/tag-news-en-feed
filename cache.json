Dogecoin was also higher on the news, extending recent gains.\n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nLitecoin (LTC) was once again in the green, as prices of the token rose above $80.00 on Tuesday.\n \nFollowing a low of $75.20 to start the week, LTC/USD surged to an intraday peak of $86.34 earlier today.\n \nAs a result of the move, litecoin has risen to a seven-day high, breaking out of a ceiling at $85.00 in the process.\n \n \nOverall, LTC is up nearly $20.00 in the last four days, since dropping to a bottom at $65.39 on Saturday.\n \nThe latest rally in price has pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) to a reading of 49.53, which is its highest point since March 2.\n \nThis is marginally above a ceiling at 48.00, and should price strength remain beyond this point, LTC bulls will likely attempt to reach $90.00.\n \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nIn addition to LTC, dogecoin (DOGE) also extended recent gains, with the meme coin climbing for a fifth straight day.\n \nDOGE/USD has risen to an intraday high of $0.07492 earlier on Tuesday, which comes a day after trading at a low of $0.06866.\n \nThis rally comes as dogecoin broke out of a recent resistance level at $0.0730, with the RSI also climbing above a ceiling of its own.\n \n \nAt the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 47.15, which is well above the aforementioned ceiling at 45.00.\n \nIn addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average is now firmly in an uptrend, with a ceiling of $0.08000 a possible target for bulls.\n \nPrice strength is closing in on a ceiling at 50.00.
