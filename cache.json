          "description": "Dogecoin was one of Thursday’s big movers, as the cryptocurrency climbed by as much as 10% in today’s session. The surge in price comes as traders look to find opportunities in riskier crypto assets, with the meme coin realm ticking this box. Shiba inu also gained, reaching its highest point in over two months. \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) rose by over 10% earlier in today’s session, as the global cryptocurrency market cap returned to the green.\n \nDOGE/USD peaked at $0.07489 on Thursday, which comes following a low of $0.06596 the day before.\n \nToday’s move sent dogecoin to its strongest point since August 14, when the price climbed to a high of $0.0771.\n \n \nOverall, this is the seventh day in the last eight sessions that the meme coin has traded in the green.\n \nThis latest surge has pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) to a current reading of 80.21, above a ceiling at 76.00.\n \nAs a result of price being overbought, current buyers may now begin to secure their profits.\n \n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) was another notable gainer on Thursday, as price rose for a second consecutive day.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.000007429 on Wednesday, SHIB/USD rallied to an intraday high of $0.000008208 earlier today.\n \nSimilar to dogecoin, today’s gains have sent SHIB to its highest level since August, after the price rose by nearly 10% today.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, earlier gains have somewhat faded, as a result of the RSI failing to break out of a ceiling at 70.00.\n \nAs of writing, price strength now sits at 69.15, with a floor at 61.00 a likely target should momentum begin to shift.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect shiba inu to climb higher this week?

Nearly $20 million in digital currencies were moved after the estate transferred $8.6 million in cryptocurrencies to Binance earlier in the day.\n \nFTX Mobilizes Millions in Crypto to Centralized Exchanges in Second Major Move\n \nThe estate handling FTX’s bankruptcy has been relocating coins to centralized crypto exchanges. Following an $8.6 million transfer on Wednesday, the estate moved nearly $20 million during the evening hours of that day. The analytics and onchain intelligence company Peckshield detected the movement, with its alert system notifying the community at 10:56 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday.\n \nPeckshield disclosed that about 470,000 solana (SOL), worth $15 million, were moved to centralized exchanges including Binance. The onchain analytics alert system further detailed that FTX transferred coins such as ETH, COMP, and RNDN. Further, an additional $2.5 million in ether was reportedly sent to the centralized exchange Coinbase.\n \n“In addition, FTX-labeled address has transferred ~1,393 ETH (~$2.5M) to Coinbase,” the Peckshield alert added.\n \n \nObservers can only speculate that the coins were sent to be sold, as their movements become opaque once held on an exchange. Besides sending crypto assets to exchanges, presumably to trade or sell them, FTX debtors have also engaged in staking assets. To date, the estate has staked millions worth of SOL and roughly $5 million worth of ether. The estate continues to work on the final proposals in the bankruptcy case, drawing closer to completion.\n \nWhat do you think about FTX moving funds to centralized crypto exchanges?
