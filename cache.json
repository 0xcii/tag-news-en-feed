The “transaction fees” here refer to the average fees (in USD) that senders on the ETH network are currently attaching to their transfers.\n \nThis metric’s value generally reflects the traffic conditions the blockchain is witnessing. When many users are making moves on the network, the average fees tend to go up.\n \n \nThis is a result of the blockchain’s limited capacity to process transactions, which can cause the network to get clogged during periods of high activity and…",
