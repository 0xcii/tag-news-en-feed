Testing of the secure element chips is slated to continue throughout the first half of 2023.\n \n         \n         \n         \n        The TROPIC01 prototypes. \n    \nThe press release describes how “initial test results are very positive and have already shown that the chip development can continue as originally planned – to produce a second prototype next year and then, after verification, start mass serial production.”\nTropic Square’s goal with the design and production of the chip is to create an open-source security chip for usage in Bitcoin hardware. Bitcoin Magazine previously covered the announcement of the chip in August 2022, in which the Tropic Square team described how “Being open-source will allow the company to make improvements based on community and expert feedback.”\nAccording to Tropic Square CEO Evzen Englberth, the testing “brings us substantially closer to mass production and closer to the introduction of the first transparent solution. These chips will then have the chance to fundamentally change the current security standards in the market.”\nJan Pleskač, CTO of Tropic Square, describes how “Examining and vetting the chip from every possible angle will help ensure the quality and reliability of the final product that goes out into the world.” \nThe press release details the company’s plans to make the final pre-production prototypes in the coming year, then hopefully start mass production and launch their product on the market in 2025.",

          "description": "PRESS RELEASE. Like bitcoin, the four Seasonal Tokens – Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter – are produced by proof-of-work mining and go through regular halvings that make them harder to obtain as time goes on. Once every nine months, the rate of production of one of the tokens is cut in half.

On the 6th of March, that rate will drop to one token every 8.6 seconds. Summer tokens, which are currently the cheapest of the four, are expected to become the most expensive over the following months as the market adjusts to the lower rate of supply.\n \nThis process has already happened once before, after the Spring halving in Jun…",
