The move comes ahead of industry expectations for launches later this year.\nMultiple Chinese financial institutions, including the Hong Kong subsidiaries of Harvest Fund and China Southern Fund, have applied for bitcoin ETFs recently. Spot bitcoin ETFs provide exposure to actual bitcoin rather than derivatives.\nAccording to sources, the SFC will announce its first approved batch of spot bitcoin ETFs on April 15. After approvals, the funds can then be applied to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which is expected to take 10 days.\nThis accelerated timeline demonstrates Hong Kong's proactive approach in enhancing its appeal as a global financial hub. It also builds on the city's Bitcoin-friendly stance, including granting crypto exchange Hashkey a retail trading license last year.\nThe news comes after the tremendous success of spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States after approval this January, which attracted over $12 billion in inflows. As the first Asian jurisdiction to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, Hong Kong is paving the way for potential launches in other markets.\nAccessible Bitcoin investment products have seen rapid growth in demand among both institutional and retail investors. By leveraging its regulatory framework to meet this appetite, Hong Kong cements its position as a rising Bitcoin hub in Asia.",
