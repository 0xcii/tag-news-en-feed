          "description": "Terraform Labs, the company at the center of a significant collapse in 2022, has agreed to pay a substantial settlement of $4.47 billion to resolve a civil lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \n \nThis legal action was undertaken following the collapse, which resulted in the loss of $40 billion in investor assets and sent shockwaves throughout the cryptocurrency industry.\n \nTerraform Labs And Do Kwon Liable For Collapse\n \nThe SEC recently sought approval from a federal judge in New York for the settlement with Terraform. The agreement was reached subsequent to a jury finding the company and its co-founder, Do Kwon, liable for the collapse after a two-week trial.\n \n \nAccording to the settlement filing, “Payment of the monetary remedies against Kwon shall be deemed satisfied, provided that all transfers by Kwon to the SEC and the Terraform bankruptcy estate in the Bankruptcy Case total no less than $204,320,196. Transferring into an escrow account agreed by Kwon and the Commission staff $4,700,000 within 30 days of Final Judgment.”\n \nVictory For SEC\n \nThe SEC’s allegations against Terraform Labs and Kwon state that from at least April 2018 through May 2022, Terraform and Kwon offered and sold crypto asset “securities in unregistered transactions” and perpetrated a fraudulent scheme that led to the loss of at least $40 billion of market value.\n \nAdditionally, regulators alleged the defendants misled investors about TerraUSD’s stability, falsely claiming Terraform’s blockchain was integrated into popular Korean mobile payment apps.\n \n \nUltimately, this development represents a victory for the US SEC, as Terraform Labs and its founder Do Kwon, who is facing extradition to the US, had previously proposed civil penalties of up to $3.5 million, with Do Kwon requesting a penalty of $800,000. \n \n \nAs of this writing, the company’s Luna Classic (LUNC) token is trading at $0.0001076, up nearly 8% in the 24-hour time frame. \n \nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",

          "description": "After 20 years of forever wars, growing social decline and exacerbating economic demise, it seems that we are still immune to learning that politicians lie. Practically, the US is still in the same place it was in 2004, fueling raging conflicts across the Middle East. The treasury is still overleveraged to both its ears, the stock and housing markets again lie on the brink of implosion, homelessness still continues to rise, jobs are still scarce, and still nobody really knows how to pay for anything. \nIf there is a point to be made about US politics, it’s that it doesn’t matter whether the man in alleged charge of the country is an army-dodging goon that can’t figure out how to use binoculars, a progressive in t-shirts campaigning for unity and peace while bombing the life out of Somalians…",

Each user gets a separate wallet to ensure asset segregation.\nAs Brazil's largest bank with extensive reach, opening Bitcoin access will boost mainstream adoption. With Bitcoin's popularity in Brazil, the bank aims to be their preferred gateway into this new asset class.\nThe embrace of Bitcoin and crypto by a conservatively regulated institution like Itaú also further validates Bitcoin as an investable innovation that is here to stay. More banks in the region may follow suit.\nFor bitcoiners in Brazil, buying and selling through their existing bank provides accessibility and removes adoption hurdles. Itaú opening the floodgates marks a milestone in Bitcoin's financial mainstreaming in a major Latin American economy.",

The people behind Breez are split across three continents and come from a broad range of national and ethnic backgrounds. \nAgreeing on a communication platform (Telegram? Slack? Zoom? Discord?) sometimes takes a bit of coordination. What never needs coordination, though, is the language we use to communicate. It’s always automatically English.
