Standard Chartered has been positive on Bitcoin for years and is now moving to meet surging institutional demand.\nStandard Chartered said, \"We have been working closely with our regulators to support demand from our institutional clients to trade Bitcoin and Ether.\"\nThe bank already offers crypto custody through its stake in Zodia Custody. It is also an investor in Zodia Markets, which trades institutional Bitcoin and crypto. This bolt-on trading desk represents the next phase in Standard Chartered's Bitcoin push.\nThe move comes as Bitcoin ETFs gain approval and launch across major markets like the US, UK, Hong Kong and Australia. With institutional appetite growing, banks realize they must adapt to remain competitive.\nStandard Chartered's offering of direct Bitcoin trading capabilities reflects the accelerating mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. It indicates that banks consider Bitcoin a crucial new asset class they can no longer avoid. \nThis infrastructure buildout will, in turn, enable wider institutional adoption. Other major banks will likely follow Standard Chartered's lead in rolling out spot Bitcoin trading.",
