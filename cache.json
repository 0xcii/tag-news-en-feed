          "description": "European Union (EU) lawmakers  \nhave voted in favour of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, making  \nEurope the first major jurisdiction to introduce a comprehensive law to  \nregulate the emerging digital assets industry. The European Parliament on  \nThursday overwhelmingly supported the passage of the law, with 517 votes against 38 (and 18 abstentions). \nMiCA, which was first opened for  \ndiscussion in September 2020, seeks to protect European consumers, enshrine environmental sustainability and prevent  \nmoney laundering in the crypto industry. The regulation now awaits final  \napproval from the Council of the European Union.\nThe favorable vote to pass the  \ncrypto rules comes after a debate on Wednesday during which lawmakers signaled  \nmajority support for the law. MiCA, which is expected to go live sometime  \nin 2024, requires digital asset exchanges and crypto wallet providers to obtain  \na license to operate within any country in the region. The regulation also  \ndemands that stablecoin issuers hold sufficient reserves.  \nThe Council of the European  \nUnion and the European Parliament, the two legislative bodies of the EU, reached provisional agreements for the rules in June last year. In recent months,  \nthe EU twice postponed the vote on the much-awaited crypto rules due  \nto technical delays in translating the regulation into the 24 languages of the  \npolitical bloc.\nMeanwhile, lawmakers on Thursday  \nalso voted resoundingly in favour of a separate law known as the Transfer of  \nFunds regulation. The regulation requires digital asset operators to identify  \ntheir customers so as to prevent money laundering. \n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Solomon Oladipupo at www.financemagnates.com.",
