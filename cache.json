          "description": "According to Yuga Labs, creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), the team has partnered with the popular Japanese fashion brand A Bathing Ape, commonly known as Bape. They plan to unveil a new “irreverent collection” together at Apefest in Hong Kong this November.\n \nBAYC Partners With Fashion Brand Bape\n \nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club is teaming up with streetwear company Bape for a new collection, Yuga Labs announced. Founded in 1993 by Nigo (Tomoaki Nagao) in Ura-Harajuku, Bape is a renowned Japanese fashion brand. The company operates 19 stores globally, offering men’s, women’s and children’s lifestyle and streetwear.\n \n“Together, the two brands have reimagined iconic designs from Bape’s deep archives and usher in a return to the golden age of streetwear collecting,” Yuga Labs said on September 25. “With one foot in Bape’s Ura-Harajuku roots and the other in the BAYC swamp, this collection offers Bape heads and BAYC members exclusive access to apparel and accessories that reflect their shared appreciation for laid back opulence and irreverence.”\n \n \nThe recent news about BAYC and Bape comes after a notable decrease in the value of BAYC non-fungible token (NFT) assets this year. BAYC NFT floor prices have plummeted, and weekly sales volumes have consistently decreased. This isn’t BAYC’s first partnership with a prominent streetwear brand; they teamed up with Adidas in 2021 and also worked with music-focused magazine Rolling Stone on an exclusive cover design.\n \n“As Fashion goes hand-in-hand with Web3, particularly in the current times, where the two have the power to impact each other almost instantaneously, we are thrilled to present this groundbreaking collaboration with Yuga Labs,” Thomas Hui, chief operating officer at Bape said.\n \nWhat do you think about BAYC teaming up with Bape?

          "description": "The U.S. securities regulator recently announced a delay in its verdict on the Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF. Consequently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has marked January 10, 2024, as the decisive day to either greenlight or reject the proposed amendment.\n \nSEC Pushes Back Decision on 2 Spot Bitcoin ETFs\n \nA statement from the U.S. securities authority highlighted its decision to push back its judgment on the Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF, an asset-backed fund aiming for public listing. The filing for this ETF was jointly presented by Cboe BZX Exchange, 21shares, and Ark Invest on April 25, 2023.\n \nThis ETF joined the ranks of several spot bitcoin ETF applications, with industry giants like Invesco, Blackrock, Fidelity, Vaneck, Valkyrie, Wisdomtree, and Franklin Templeton all in the queue. Notably, the SEC had previously postponed its decision on seven of these filings, including the Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF, on August 31, 2023.\n \nUpon a detailed examination of the proposal and subsequent modifications, the SEC said on Tuesday that it chose to prolong the evaluation phase to guarantee a comprehensive review. “The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 3, and the issues raised therein,” the SEC detailed.\n \n \n“I’m shocked they went this early on Ark and 21Shares. My assumption is they’re worried about the government shutdown and trying to get ahead of that,” Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said on Tuesday. In addition to the Ark 21shares filing, the securities watchdog also deferred its decision on the spot bitcoin ETF filing submitted by Global X and its listing partner Cboe BZX.\n \nWhat do you think about the SEC’s recent delay on two spot bitcoin ETF registrations? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.",

Lido has now amassed nearly one-third of all ETH staked.
