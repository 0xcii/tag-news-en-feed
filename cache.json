          "description": "Bitwage, a leading provider of Bitcoin payroll and invoicing, has introduced a solution that allows employers to seamlessly connect their payroll providers to Bitwage's service. This development simplifies and ensures compliance for workers who wish to receive a percentage of their paycheck in Bitcoin, stablecoins or USD. Notably, this solution is compatible with various payroll providers, including ADP, Paychex, Paycom, Gusto, Trinet and many others.\nAccording to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, what sets Bitwage apart is its non-custodial experience, ensuring that employees receive their payments directly into the wallet of their choice, maximizing security and minimizing risk. \nTo implement this solution, companies need to sign up on the Bitwage platform and connect their payroll provider through the Bitwage Automated Connection. From there, Bitwage creates a custom, post-tax benefit on the payroll provider's portal, allowing employees to opt-in. Employees can then choose the amount they wish to be deducted from their paycheck and distributed through Bitwage.\nWith each pay cycle, Bitwage automatically generates a payroll for each employee based on their payroll preferences, extracting the necessary data directly from the payroll system. Employees can receive their payments directly into their preferred Bitcoin, crypto or stablecoin wallet or even as their local currency into their bank accounts.\nBitwage's CEO, Jonathan Chester, emphasized their mission to enable workforces to be paid in their preferred method, whether it's bitcoin or fiat. “We recognize that crypto can be scary for employers, so to enable this mission, we are building out fully compliant solutions and removing the complexities and custodial risk of crypto from the equation,” Chester said.",

Volatility has been high most of the week, with today seeing the global market cap drop by 0.95% as of writing. Chainlink also slipped in today’s session.\n \nCosmos (ATOM)\n \nCosmos (ATOM) dropped to a key support point on Friday, as bearish sentiment returned to the market.\n \nFollowing a high of $10.92 on Thursday, ATOM/USD slipped to an intraday bottom of $10.50 earlier in the day.\n \nThe drop in price saw the token collide with its long-term floor, with bulls opting to buy the dip from that point.\n \n \nAt the time of writing, ATOM is trading at $10.61, which is still almost 3% lower than yesterday’s peak.\n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the shift in momentum came after a failed breakout of a ceiling of 48.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nThe index is now tracking at 40.72, which is marginally above an upcoming floor at the 40.00 mark.\n \n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nIn addition to ATOM, chainlink (LINK) also fell on Friday, extending a recent decline in the process.\n \nAfter a recent four-day bull run, LINK/USD edged lower in today’s session, dropping for a second straight day.\n \nLINK/USD hit a bottom of $6.46 during the day, which comes after a high of $6.69 on Thursday.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, today’s slippage pushed LINK close to a support point of its own at $6.45.\n \nThe token has since rebounded, and is currently trading at the $6.51 level, which came as the RSI also hit a floor.\n \nPrice strength moved to the 40.00 zone earlier in the day, but has marginally risen as the day progressed.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill cryptocurrencies rebound this weekend?
