Cryptocurrency markets consolidated recent gains in today’s session, with the global market cap down by 0.24% as of writing. Solana continued to trade above $20.00, as prices consolidated. \n \nCosmos (ATOM)\n \nCosmos (ATOM) was once again in the green, as prices remained close to a recent multi-week high.\n \nFollowing a high of $13.47 on Tuesday, ATOM/USD hit a peak of $13.41 earlier in today’s session, before prices have since plunged.\n \nSince hitting a three-week high during yesterday’s session, cosmos bulls have moved to consolidate gains, with ATOM now trading at $12.55.\n \n \nOverall, bulls have seemingly moved to take profits, following a failed breakout attempt of the $13.50 ceiling.\n \nLooking at the chart, the decline comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) was also unable to move past a resistance zone of its own at 57.00\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 51.52, with a floor at 50.00 a possible destination for traders.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nIn addition to ATOM, solana (SOL) also remained near a recent high, despite market sentiment shifting in today’s session.\n \nSOL/USD fell to a low of $20.31 earlier in today’s session, hours removed from a peak at the $22.11 mark.\n \nYesterday’s high saw solana trade at its strongest point since March 2, when the token was trading close to $23.00.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the SOL bulls began shifting away from earlier positions, following a collision with a ceiling on the RSI.\n \nPrice strength hit a point of resistance at the 50.00 level, which has been in place since late-February.\n \nAs of writing, the index is now tracking at 48.91, with the next visible floor at the 45.00 level.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nHas the recent bull wave completely faded?

For Bitcoin miners, firmware allows them to adjust the performance of the ASIC chips in their Bitcoin mining rigs to optimize for higher hash rate and improved power efficiency.” \nWhen mining profitability is low, miners can utilize firmware to improve their machine’s power efficiency to increase gross margins. When profitability is high, miners can use their firmware to increase a machine’s hash rate in an attempt to quicken their return on their investment.\nLuxor CEO Nick Hansen described how, “We’ve received consistent feedback from our partners that the market lacked a US-designed-and-engineered custom firmware to help them improve their mining margins. Luxor’s team was uniquely positioned to build this product and we’re thrilled to open up our firmware to old and new partners alike,”\nAccording to the press release, LuxOS is available now for the Bitmain Antminer S19 series and S9 series Bitcoin miners. The Luxor team custom built the firmware using Rust, and it does not rely on open-source options like CG miner. In addition to this, Bitcoin miners who use LuxOS will receive discounted fees when they use Luxor’s bitcoin mining pool.",
