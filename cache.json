However, the Bitcoin Mining Council, initiated by Michael Saylor, tries to disprove that this is only half the truth with its quarterly reports.\n \nBitcoin is powered by almost 60% green energy. But even on a small scale, BTC mining can do big wonders, according to a new report from MIT Technology Review that was shared by Saylor via Twitter.\n \nVirunga National Park is the first national park in the world to recognize the potential of Bitcoin mining, supporting nature, the park’s endangered mountain gorillas, and the resident community.\n \nAs the report discusses, the Bitcoin mine is powered by the giant hydroelectric plant on the same mountain that makes the national …",

          "description": "Bitcoin consolidated on Jan. 16, as U.S. markets closed in celebration of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday celebration. Traders have seemingly moved to secure recent gains, after the world’s largest cryptocurrency rose above $21,000 for the first time since November. Ethereum also retreated from recent highs in today’s session. \n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) consolidated to start the week, as prices failed to break out of a key resistance level.\n \nFollowing a high of $21,345.25 on Sunday, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $20,681.98 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThis drop comes as the world’s largest cryptocurrency was unable to move beyond its long-term ceiling at $21,400.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, this was somewhat expected, due to the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovering in overbought territory.\n \nAs of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 86.65, after failing to move north of the 90.00 mark.\n \nIt is likely that further declines could be on the cards this week, with a floor of $20,000 a potential target for sellers.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also retreated from recent highs, which comes after a failed breakout of its own.\n \nETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,529.79 earlier today, which comes after trading at a high of $1,579.48 on Sunday.\n \nEthereum failed to sustain a move above a ceiling at $1,580, giving way to a resurgence of some bearish sentiment.\n \n \nLike with bitcoin, ethereum prices were significantly overbought, with the index at its highest point since January 2021.\n \nNow tracking at 83.46, the next visible floor seems to be at the 70.00 mark, which if hit, could see ETH trading near $1,475.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect ethereum to fall lower in the coming days?

However, the document reveals that the Central Bank registered Ripple partner LATAM SOFTWARE S.A.S. as a “money transfer company” and granted it the right to outsource services specifically to Ripple.\n \nAs a result of a review by the Superin…",

According to the lawsuit, during the service interruption, the average number of orders per hour doubled, causing transaction flows to significantly slow down.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nA district court initially ruled in favor of Bithumb against the investors. However, the decision was subsequently overturned by an appellate court, which ordered Bithumb to pay damages ranging from 8,000 won to 8 million won to each of the 132 investors. The supreme court upheld this ruling Thursday.\n \n\n \nAccording to the appellate court:\n \n\nThe burden or the cost of technological failures should be shouldered by the service operator, not service users who pay commission for the service.\n \n\n \nDo you think cryptocurrency exchanges should be held accountable for service outages that cause monetary losses to investors?
