Valkyrie is diversifying the custody of  \nits coins by leveraging BitGo's expertise alongside Coinbase.\nThis collaboration marks a pivotal moment in the  \nevolution of cryptocurrency investments, emphasizing the industry's commitment  \nto robust risk mitigation strategies. The collaboration with BitGo aligns with regulators'  \nrequirements in the US and globally, setting a benchmark for Bitcoin ETF  \nsecurity.\nBitcoin ETF Adoption \nMike Belshe, the CEO of BitGo, mentioned:  \n\"Valkyrie Investments has already made a name for itself, providing  \ninvestors with funds to tap into the digital asset space. Earlier this year,  \nthey took a new step forward with their newest ETF to help investors around the  \nworld get access to Bitcoin. It's a privilege to be their custodian to support  \ntheir product.\"\nBitGo secures approximately 20% of all on-chain  \nBitcoin transactions by value and supports over 700 digital assets within its  \nplatform, according to the company. Meanwhile, Valkyrie Funds combines  \nblockchain technology with investment vehicles across traditional markets.\nLast month, the SEC made a historic move by  \napproving applications for 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs),  \nallowing them to be listed on US stock exchanges.\nShift in Crypto Landscape\nHowever, the SEC's Chief Gary Gensler emphasized  \nthat the approval does not signal a broad acceptance of all crypto assets,  \nhighlighting the regulator's stance on non-compliant market participants. The  \napproval marked a milestone in the evolution of crypto assets within  \ntraditional financial frameworks.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.",
