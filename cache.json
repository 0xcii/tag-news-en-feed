The extradition comes almost a year after he and Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon were arrested while attempting to flee the country.\n \nAccording to the police, the decision to transfer Han into South Korean custody was made by the Montenegro Justice Ministry. As previously reported by Bitcoin.com News, Han and Do Kwon were arrested after authorities found them in possession of counterfeit identity documents.\n \nThey were subsequently sentenced to four months in jail for the offence. Do Kwon later appealed the verdict, but a superior court reportedly rejected his appeal in November 2023.\n \n \nExplaining the government’s decision to extradite the financial officer, the Montenegro police said:\n \n\nHan [was extradited to allow South Korean authorities to initiate] criminal proceedings for several criminal offences related to fraud in financial investment services, investments and the capital market, which is punishable by life imprisonment in South Korea.\n \nHowever, concerning the extradition of Do Kwon, who is wanted by both South Korean and U.S. authorities, the Terraform Labs co-founder’s lawyer said they were waiting for the court to make a ruling on another appeal.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
