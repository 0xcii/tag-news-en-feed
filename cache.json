          "description": "Coinbase has unveiled a new feature to its wallet service, streamlining international fund transfers. This new update aims to make the transfer of funds as effortless as sending a text.\n \nCoinbase Unveils Link-Based Money Transfer Service\n \nCoinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) has launched its latest wallet feature that facilitates global fund transfers. The platform now allows users to transfer money across various channels, including widely used messaging and social media apps, by merely sharing a link.\n \nAnnounced on Tuesday, Coinbase explained this feature circumvents the need for intricate banking details and expensive wire transactions, offering immediate settlements without charge. The update includes compatibility with various social media and messaging applications such as Whatsapp, Instagram, Tiktok, Facebook, Telegram, Snapchat, and also via email.\n \nIn essence, the service functions on any platform capable of sharing a link. Coinbase clarified that if the recipient does not claim the funds within two weeks, they automatically revert to the sender. Coinbase’s new payment method is akin to those provided by major payment corporations like Paypal and Stripe.\n \n \nPaypal facilitates link-based transactions through a service named Paypal.me. In this service, individuals can generate a personalized link to solicit payments directly to their Paypal account. Paypal’s feature can be used for crypto payments associated with the select digital assets it supports.\n \nTargeting both novices and seasoned users, Coinbase has also rolled out a ‘simple mode’ in its non-custodial wallet. This feature concentrates on core functionalities such as purchasing, sending, receiving, and safeguarding digital currencies.\n \nWhat do you think about the new feature added to Coinbase’s non-custodial wallet service?
