Of course, in true cartoon fashion, buried between wild exaggeration and embellishment. \nThe end goal of the cartoon was to propose a new mechanism for moving in and out of scaling layers built on top of Bitcoin. To disentangle that actual proposal from the cartoon, we’ll have to break down the two pieces involved. \nThe Building Blocks\nRijndael’s first OP_CAT experiment was constructing a vault, a scheme that allows a user to create an intermediate “staging” transaction to withd…",

This quadrennial event will reduce the block subsidy for Bitcoin miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, thereby halving the reward that miners receive for their efforts. Such events have historically led to profound shifts in the mining landscape, potentially influencing various economic and operational facets of Bitcoin mining.\nEconomic Outlook and Market Predictions\nAfter the halving, the immediate impact is a considerable decrease in miner revenue due to the reduced block subsidy. This could lead to a decline in the hashrate as less efficient miners may turn unprofitable and exit the network.
