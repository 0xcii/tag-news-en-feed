          "description": "After being the victim of a red wave on Thursday, XRP rebounded in today’s session, as crypto bulls remained resilient. The global market cap is up by 0.40% at the time of writing, following a 2% drop yesterday. Stellar was another strong mover on Friday, and is currently up 2.25% \n \nXRP\n \nXRP was back in the green on Friday, after bulls abruptly ended a three-day win streak during yesterday’s session.\n \nFollowing a low at $0.5025 on Thursday, XRP/USD moved to a peak at $0.5134 earlier in the day.\n \nThe surge saw XRP, formerly ripple, once again make strides towards a key resistance level at $0.5450.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears that the rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) climbed back above a ceiling at 47.00.\n \nAt present, price strength is now sitting at 48.72, with the next visible ceiling near the 54.00 region.\n \nIn the event this target is hit, there is a strong likelihood that XRP moves above $0.5400.\n \n \nStellar (XLM)\n \nStellar (XLM) was also in the green in today’s session, after two consecutive days of price declines.\n \nXLM/USD peaked at $0.1154 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a low of $0.1122.\n \nAs a result of the decline, bulls continued to push the token away from a recent floor at $0.1100, and back on course toward resistance at $0.1320.\n \n \nToday’s rebound was helped by the RSI reaching a floor of its own at 37.00, and it is now tracking at 39.87.\n \nA ceiling at 44.00 now awaits bulls, and could be the main hurdle preventing further gains this weekend.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhere will stellar end this weekend?
