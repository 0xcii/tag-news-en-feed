          "description": "Bitcoin rebounded from recent lows on Thursday, as bulls moved to buy the dip, following a drop below the $26,000 level. The rally comes as traders rejected a full breakout below a key support point of $25,600. Ethereum was also back in the green during today’s session. \n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin climbed higher on Thursday, as bulls moved to buy the recent dip in price, following a drop below the $26,000 level.\n \nAfter trading at a low of $25,805.00 on Wednesday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak of $26,786.90 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThis is the strongest point that bitcoin has hit since last Thursday, when the cryptocurrency was trading above the $28,000 mark.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the surge sent the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) to a ceiling of 28.00, which is also a one-week high.\n \nAs of writing, price strength has moved below this point, however should a breakout occur, there is a good chance that BTC will head above $27,000.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) was also back in the green, and neared a breakout above the $1,700 zone late on Wednesday.\n \nETH/USD rallied to a high of $1,696.59 during yesterday’s session, less than 24 hours after the price was at a bottom $1,634.87.\n \nLike with BTC above, today saw ethereum trade at its highest point in a week, with price peaking above $1,800 last Thursday.\n \n \nThe 14-day RSI has also collided with a key resistance level, in this occasion at the 34.00 zone.\n \nSentiment has marginally shifted, with the index now at 32.04, resulting in the easing of earlier gains.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCan ethereum hit $1,800 this week?
