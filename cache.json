As September nears its end with six days remaining, NFT sales have tallied up to $341.37 million since August 24.\n \nNFT Sales Still Can’t Escape Crypto Winter’s Wrath\n \nThis September, over the last seven days, NFT sales touched $78.88 million, marking a 3.2% dip from the preceding week, according to cryptoslam.io stats. 2023 has seen a consistent slump in digital collectible sales, and September is no exception.\n \n\n \nThe monthly tally stands at $341.37 million, a sharp 34.08% decline from the previous month. Ethereum continues its dominance in NFT sales, raking in $177,743,112 over the last month.\n \n\n \nHowever, it’s worth noting that ETH-centric NFT sales have dropped by 41.84% since the month prior. Trailing Ethereum is the Mythos blockchain, registering $31.89 million in sales — a notable 24.86% surge from the month before. Following Mythos are Polygon, Solana, Immutable X, and Bitcoin in terms of 30-day sales.\n \nDmarket, Draftkings, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Gods Unchained, and Sorare top the charts in 30-day sales records. However, the latter three NFT collections faced setbacks this month, while Dmarket and Draftkings enjoyed upticks ranging between 15% and 24%.\n \nEthereum’s crowning NFT sale this month was a “Mega Zombie,” fetching a price of $800,044. Immutable X’s “Cross the Ages #223963” took second place, selling for $151,012. Rounding off the top three was a Bitcoin-based NFT from the “OCM Dimensions” collection, which garnered $106,708.\n \n2023 has proven challenging for NFT investors, with prices taking a substantial hit. It’s been a chilling crypto winter, and NFTs haven’t been spared its icy grasp. The industry awaits, with bated breath, to see if NFT markets will find their spring resurgence.\n \nWhat do you think about the last 30 days of NFT sales?
