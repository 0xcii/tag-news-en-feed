          "description": "It appears X, Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and xAI won't be issuing their own cryptocurrency anytime soon.\nAnnounced on X late last week, Elon Musk has declared that none of his companies will be launching a cryptocurrency token, in a move that underscores a shift in the tech industry's attitude toward competing with Bitcoin as a digital currency. \nThis announcement is particularly noteworthy in light of X (formerly Twitter), which recently announced its intention to transform into a platform for financial services. Previously, there had been speculation that Musk might integrate Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency he has vocally supported in the past, into his companies' operations.\nUnder the leadership of Jack Dorsey, Twitter was known for its pro-Bitcoin stance, actively incorporating new features like Bitcoin tipping, a feature that has attracted him to the upstart social network, Nostr. However, Elon Musk has seemed to walk back that support, creating questions about his intentions.\nMusk's decision not to launch a crypto token carries significance, as it suggests that the concept of issuing worthless cryptocurrencies is losing favor among prominent Silicon Valley tech leaders. \nThis shift in sentiment could be attributed to the increasing regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency industry, or simply the failures over the last decade for any crypto token to differentiate from Bitcoin. \nWith Musk's reputation as a tech visionary and influencer, his statement may influence other tech leaders and entrepreneurs, to put the idea to rest as well.",

In addition, the two organizations reportedly pledged to promote its use in decentralized finance (defi) protocols.\n \nAccording to a Globalcrypto TV report, the planned injection of “substantial” of liquidity into the ZARP network would broaden Old Mutual Wealth’s relationship with the stablecoin project. As previously reported by Bitcoin.com News, the financial services giant has been the manager of the stablecoin project’s cash reserves since Sept. 2022.\n \n\n \nCommenting on the two companies’ decision to enhance support for the stablecoin, Simon Dingle, the managing director Inves Capital, said:\n \n“We are now extending our relationship to explore new frontiers in decentralised finance and provide deep liquidity to emerging capital markets. Crypto is entering a new phase of growth and ZARP is braced to play a central role in representing rand value in these exciting new protocols.”\n \nDingle, who also manages the stablecoin, suggested that South Africa’s decision to designate crypto assets as a financial product may have played a part in convincing Old Mutual and his firm.\n \nFarhad Sader, the managing director of Old Mutual, said seeing “the potential application of the technology first-hand” made the decision to honor its pledge to extend its partnership with the stablecoin project easier.\n \nRegister your email here to get a weekly update on African news sent to your inbox:\n \n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
