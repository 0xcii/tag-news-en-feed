Lewis Fellas, an asset manager with more than two decades of experience, including seven years in the digital assets sector, will lead this division.\n \n\n \nThe press release highlights the merger of Coinshares‘ ten years in crypto with the expertise the team has developed from proprietary trading since 2016. The firm holds that this experience equips it to produce competitive products comparable to those of mainstream financial entities.\n \n“In a changing macro environment prominently marked by interest rates and inflation, the demand for actively managed exposure to digital assets is a natural progression,” remarked Coinshares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti.\n \nMognetti added:\n \n\nThe new division signifies the latest step in Coinshares’ evolution.\n \n \nRegistered as a broker-dealer with FINRA, Coinshares will introduce the hedge fund offerings to eligible U.S. investors. The company noted in its release, “The long-awaited return of interest rate-driven volatility is a great opportunity that we plan to capture with our novel fund products.”\n \n“Each product that will be offered is designed to mitigate counterparty risk whilst providing investors with clearly defined asset class and strategy exposures,” Fellas concluded.\n \nWhat do you think about Coinshares’ new hedge fund division?

          "description": "According to Peak Mining, a subsidiary of Northern Data Group, the company has signed a contract with bitcoin mining rig manufacturer Microbt worth $150 million. This agreement will equip Peak Mining with 7 exahash per second (EH/s) of the latest next-generation BTC mining devices.\n \nMicrobt and Northern Data’s Peak Mining Strike $150M Deal, Focus on Liquid-Cooling Advancement\n \n\n \nOn Friday, Peak Mining, a firm under the Northern Data Group umbrella, announced its purchase of $150 million in Microbt Whatsminer machines. The acquisition includes the Whatsminer M53S+, M53S++, M50S+ and M50S++ models. The company noted the possibility of buying an additional $150 million in hardware down the road.\n \n\n \nThrough this purchase, Peak indicated it will be among the pioneers to introduce “liquid-cooling mining technology at this scale.” The first shipment of these liquid-cooled Microbt miners is expected in October 2023, with installation set for North Dakota.\n \n\n \n“The new contract will significantly increase our self-mining capacity and prepares our existing portfolio for the upcoming halving,” Niek Beudeker, the managing director at Peak Mining commented. “We choose to deploy hardware in a higher performance output mode at purpose-built next-generation infrastructure,” Beudeker added.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPeak Mining’s announcement comes on the heels of Microbt’s revelation of a new miner, the M60 series, slated for an October release. The mining rig that Microbt intends to introduce boasts an efficiency rating of 1X joules per terahash (J/T). Even as cryptocurrency markets remain consolidated and lackluster, the mining sector continues its brisk pace, with the top three mining rig manufacturers launching machines with enhanced efficiency metrics.\n \n\n \nWhat do you think about Peak’s $150 million deal with Microbt?

          "description": "Bitmain, a leading bitcoin mining rig manufacturer, has introduced the newest addition to its Antminer products: the S21 series. The newest models have an efficiency rating under 20 joules per terahash (J/T) and produce between 200 terahash per second (TH/s) and 335 TH/s.\n \nBitmain Launches 2 New Antminers; Invests $54M in Core Scientific\n \nAt the 2023 World Digital Mining Summit in Hong Kong, Bitmain showcased its latest rigs from the Antminer S21 series. One machine employs hydro mining, and the other is air-cooled.\n \nThe S21 Hyd achieves up to 335 TH/s with an efficiency rating of 16 J/T. In contrast, the air-cooled S21 miner delivers up to 200 TH/s and has an efficiency rating around 17.5 J/T.\n \nThe Bitmain announcement comes after Canaan introduced its new Avalon miners. However, only one of them, the liquid cooling machine, has a 19.5 J/T efficiency, while Canaan’s air-cooled miner reaches 21.5 J/T.\n \n\n \nAdditionally, competitor Microbt aims to launch a machine with an efficiency under 20 J/T. Bitmain’s newest hydro-cooled rig contends with Microbt’s hydro-cooled M53S++ in hashrate. Nevertheless, its efficiency rating of 16 J/T outperforms Microbt’s rig, which has 22 J/T.\n \nBesides Bitmain’s new rigs, the company has invested $54 million in Core Scientific through a fresh supply contract. Bitmain will deliver 27,000 bitcoin miners to Core Scientific and has entered a hosting agreement with the company.\n \nThe common stock and cash transaction will provide Core Scientific with Bitmain’s S19J XP Antiminer, which produces 151 TH/s and 21.7 J/T. “We look forward to deepening our strategic relationship with Core Scientific, our long-standing U.S.-based partner,” Max Hua, Bitmain’s CEO remarked.\n \nWhat do you think about Bitmain’s latest mining rigs and the efficiency ratings they provide?
