          "description": "Introduction\nYou may have heard about re-enabling OP_CAT as a potential upgrade for bitcoin's script language. Depending on where you get your news OP_CAT has been called \"only 10 lines of code\", \"the best way to enable experimentation with covenants\", \"too powerful\", \"dangerous and leading to miner centralization\", or \"guaranteed to lead to a contentious soft fork\". I'm going to make the case that all of these perspectives are mistaken. OP_CAT is very useful, can be used as a covenant, and not (alone) the best next move for bitcoin. Nothing more, and nothing less.\nTo make that case, I'm going to explore several (apparently disjoint) topics, some of which were new to me a few short months ago. I'm going to try and arrange this in a way that provides the necessary background in one place.\nH…",

          "description": "The cryptocurrency exchange landscape is a battlefield of trust. With centralized platforms still reeling from high-profile scandals like FTX and Celsius, any misstep can send user loyalty plummeting. Nexo, a platform that had recently emerged relatively unscathed, now finds itself in hot water after a surprise fee increase sparked outrage amongst its customer base.\n \n \nFrom Hero To Zero: Trust Eroded By Unannounced Fees\n \nNexo had managed to carve out a niche as a customer-centric exchange. Their ability to dodge legal troubles and a swift reversal of a disliked fee policy in April had painted a picture of a platform that listened. However, this carefully crafted image shattered on May 21st when users woke up to emails announcing a significant hike in bank transfer fees.\n \nThe new structu…",
