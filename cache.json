The slight rebound in price came as the global crypto market cap was marginally higher, climbing 0.25% as of writing. Dogecoin was also in the green.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) ended a four-day losing streak on Thursday, as crypto bulls returned following a slight stalemate earlier in the day.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.000007164 on Thursday, SHIB/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.000007287 during today’s session.\n \nThis came as traders continued to move price away from a recent support point around the $0.00000710 level.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it also appears that momentum is somewhat bullish, with the 10-day (red) moving average nearing a cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nIn order for this to happen, the relative strength index (RSI) will first need to rise beyond a ceiling at the 44.00 mark.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is tracking at 42.14, with SHIB trading at $0.000007256.\n \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) also ended a winless run on Thursday, as the meme coin rallied following two days of declines.\n \nDOGE/USD peaked at $0.06117 earlier in the day, which comes after a low of $0.06027 the day prior.\n \nSimilar to shiba inu, the moves comes as DOGE bounced away from a recent price floor at the $0.0600 level.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it seems as though the next target will be around the $0.0625 zone, which was last hit exactly a week ago.\n \nIn order to reach this point, price strength will need to climb from a current reading at 42.52, and head closer to a ceiling of 44.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect that dogecoin will hit this level in the coming days?
