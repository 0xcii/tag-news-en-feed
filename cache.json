          "description": "Bitcoin fell below the $27,000 level on Thursday, ahead of the upcoming inflation report in the United States. Consumer prices are expected to have risen by 3.6% in September, down 0.1% from the month prior. Ethereum plunged to a multi-week low.\n \nBitcoin\n \n\n \nBitcoin (BTC) fell for a fifth consecutive day, as markets prepared for the release of last month’s U.S. consumer price index (CPI)\n \n\n \nBTC/USD dropped to a low of $26,561.10 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $27,258.45.\n \n\n \nThursday’s sell-off has seen the world’s largest cryptocurrency remain near its lowest point since the end of September.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nLooking at the chart, the move pushed the relative strength index (RSI) to a support point at the 44.00 level.\n \n\n \nPrice strength has since marginally rebounded, and at the time of writing, is tracking at 45.28.\n \n\n \nThis floor may serve as a buffer ahead of the inflation report, which could then trigger an increase in volatility.\n \n\n \n\n \nEthereum\n \n\n \nEthereum (ETH) also experienced a plunge in price, with the cryptocurrency falling to a multi-week low.\n \n\n \nFollowing a high of $1,576.40 on Wednesday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,538.26 earlier in the session.\n \n\n \nAs a result, ethereum has now fallen to its weakest point since September 11, when the price traded below its $1,540 support point.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe downtrend comes following a recent crossover of the 10-day (red) moving average and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \n\n \nDue to this bearish momentum, the RSI has fallen to a current reading of 36.88, which suggests volumes are marginally oversold.\n \n\n \nThis could prompt bulls to consider buying the dip, depending on today’s inflation report.\n \n\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \n\n \nWill US inflation fall below 3.6%?

          "description": "In the world of crypto trading, there are many ways to identify opportunities, one of the most prominent methods being technical analysis. This is the study and general breaking down of charts using various indicators and charting patterns. One such technique is known as Support and Resistance strategy. \n \nSupport\n \n\n \nA support, which is also known as a floor, is the lower horizontal line holding up price at a certain level. You can identify a floor by drawing a line in the area you believe the price hits but rarely moves below. A simple strategy some traders use is buying at the floor because they have seen the markets go up each time price hits that level.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nResistance\n \n\n \nOn the other hand, a resistance (upper horizontal line) is the ceiling and reverse of the floor. When the market hits a ceiling, prices fall back down towards the floor. Traders sometimes sell when they see the price has hit a resistance.\n \n\n \n\n \nBreakout\n \n\n \nLastly, traders use these lines to identify opportunities for a breakout. A breakout is where both support and resistance is used to anticipate the point where price escapes consolidation. When the markets break out of the resistance traders normally look to buy. When the markets break out of the floor they look to sell. This strategy signals a shift in price momentum in the direction where the breakout takes place.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \n\n \nWhat other technical analysis tools would you like us to cover?
