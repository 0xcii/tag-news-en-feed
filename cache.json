However, what is interesting about this recent trend of whales accumulating DOGE is the mystery behind these addresses, as they are all brand new.\n \nDogecoin Whale Go On Buying Spree\n \nAccording to Whale Alert, an on-chain data tracking platform for large crypto transactions, there have been a number of curious transactions carried out by new Dogecoin whales. The first of these transactions was carried out by a wallet that had received 515 million DOGE on February 16, worth approximately $44 million at the time.  This wallet had not had any prior transactions before this and was a brand new wallet.\n \n \nA couple of days after the wallet received the coins, they would proceed to send o…",

By investing in Bitcoin, Reddit joins a growing list of companies that have added BTC to their balance sheets as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation.\nReddit's move also signals a broader trend of institutional adoption of Bitcoin, as more companies recognize the value proposition of BTC in today's evolving financial landscape. While Reddit did not disclose the specific amount of Bitcoin it has purchased, the decision to invest in Bitcoin underscores its belief in the resilience and potential of BTC as a store of value and investment vehicle.",

          "description": "Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest publicly traded bitcoin miner by market capitalization, has launched Slipstream, a service for individuals to easily submit complex and non-standard transactions to the Bitcoin network. Slipstream is the first instance of a public bitcoin mining company facilitating direct transaction submission services, made possible by the fact that Marathon operates its own proprietary mining pool, Mara Pool.\nAccording to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, non-standard Bitcoin transactions are often excluded from submission to Bitcoin nodes’ mempools despite their adherence to consensus parameters. These transactions, such as those associated with Ordinals and inscriptions, were already possible, but Slipstream aims to facilitate this process with a user-friendly and formalized process for direct submission.\n\nMarathon CEO Fred Thiel: “While direct transaction submission services exist, most are rudimentary. Slipstream provides sophisticated users with a simple, transparent, and trusted means of adding complex Bitcoin transactions to the blockchain, provided they adhere to Bitcoin’s protocol.”\nThiel also noted the importance of this venture to support innovation and experimentation on Bitcoin: “We believe Slipstream is mutually beneficial for the industry and for our organization, and we look forward to building on this announcement to further assist those who are building on Bitcoin.”",
