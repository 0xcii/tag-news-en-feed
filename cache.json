Roosevelt pulled off the greatest heist in American history.\nUnlike most robberies, this one was entirely legal. No safe-cracking was required; no ski masks, guns, or getaway cars. Just a pen and some White House letterhead.\nOn April 5 1933, FDR issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for anyone in the United States to own gold. By penalty of up to a $10,000 fine or 10 years in prison, everyone in the country was ordered to turn in their gold to the government, by the end of the month.1\nEO 6102 is one of the most important milestones in the history of money.

The firm expects approval by mid-2024.\nUnlike previous bitcoin exchange-traded products in Australia, Monochrome's ETF would hold actual bitcoin. This structure mirrors the highly successful spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission has already greenlighted Monochrome's proposal. Cboe Australia is now reviewing the application.\n\"We anticipate a decision from Cboe Australia about the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF before the middle of 2024,\" said CEO Jeff Yew. \"The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF stands to be the first Bitcoin ETF in Australia authorized to hold Bitcoin directly.\"\nIf approved, the ETF would provide local investors with direct exposure to bitcoin through a regulated investment vehicle. Monochrome said it chose Cboe for its strategic expertise and extensive reach across Asia.\nThe firm had originally planned to list on rival exchange ASX, but it has since pivoted to Cboe's platform.\nAustralia joining the spot bitcoin ETF movement could further validate Bitcoin as an investable asset class, as Monochrome is aiming to tap surging institutional demand as the Bitcoin industry matures.\nThe fund's launch would arrive just before Bitcoin's next halving event, likely boosting interest. As the first to hold physical bitcoin, Monochrome could quickly dominate the local ETF space in Australia.",
