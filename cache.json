The firm holds that this experience equips it to produce competitive products comparable to those of mainstream financial entities.\n \n“In a changing macro environment prominently marked by interest rates and inflation, the demand for actively managed exposure to digital assets is a natural progression,” remarked Coinshares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti.\n \nMognetti added:\n \n\nThe new division signifies the latest step in Coinshares’ evolution.\n \n \nRegistered as a broker-dealer with FINRA, Coinshares will introduce the hedge fund offerings to eligible U.S. investors. The company noted in its release, “The long-awaited return of interest rate-driven volatility is a great opportunity that we plan to capture with our novel fund products.”\n \n“Each product that will be offered is designed to mitigate counterparty risk whilst providing investors with clearly defined asset class and strategy exposures,” Fellas concluded.\n \nWhat do you think about Coinshares’ new hedge fund division?

          "description": "According to Peak Mining, a subsidiary of Northern Data Group, the company has signed a contract with bitcoin mining rig manufacturer Microbt worth $150 million. This agreement will equip Peak Mining with 7 exahash per second (EH/s) of the latest next-generation BTC mining devices.\n \nMicrobt and Northern Data’s Peak Mining Strike $150M Deal, Focus on Liquid-Cooling Advancement\n \n\n \nOn Friday, Peak Mining, a firm under the Northern Data Group umbrella, announced its purchase of $150 million in Microbt Whatsminer machines. The acquisition includes the Whatsminer M53S+, M53S++, M50S+ and M50S++ models. The company noted the possibility of buying an additional $150 million in hardware down the road.\n \n\n \nThrough this purchase, Peak indicated it will be among the pioneers to introduce “liquid-cooling mining technology at this scale.” The first shipment of these liquid-cooled Microbt miners is expected in October 2023, with installation set for North Dakota.\n \n\n \n“The new contract will significantly increase our self-mining capacity and prepares our existing portfolio for the upcoming halving,” Niek Beudeker, the managing director at Peak Mining commented. “We choose to deploy hardware in a higher performance output mode at purpose-built next-generation infrastructure,” Beudeker added.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPeak Mining’s announcement comes on the heels of Microbt’s revelation of a new miner, the M60 series, slated for an October release. The mining rig that Microbt intends to introduce boasts an efficiency rating of 1X joules per terahash (J/T). Even as cryptocurrency markets remain consolidated and lackluster, the mining sector continues its brisk pace, with the top three mining rig manufacturers launching machines with enhanced efficiency metrics.\n \n\n \nWhat do you think about Peak’s $150 million deal with Microbt?
