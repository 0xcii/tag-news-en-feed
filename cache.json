          "description": "A Turkish court has sentenced Faruk Fatih Özer, the founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange Thodex, to an effective seven months and 15 days in prison. During the trial, Özer denied being an executive of the crypto exchange when the platform allegedly failed to furnish the Tax Inspection Board with the documents requested. \n \nAppointment of Trustee Reportedly Made Submission of Requested Documents Impossible\n \nA court in Turkey has sentenced Faruk Fatih Özer, the founder of the defunct cryptocurrency exchange Thodex, to just over seven months in prison for failing to furnish the Tax Inspection Board with the documents it requested. However, according to a report in the Hurriyet Daily News, the Anatolian 17th Criminal Court of First Instance has since agreed to delay announcing the verdict as well as the implementation of the sentence.\n \nAs explained in the report, Özer, who was arrested in Albania in Aug. 2022, claimed that he was not a company executive when the alleged crime was committed. He also argued that the appointment of a trustee had made it impossible for him to submit the requested documents. Özer’s pleas nevertheless failed to sway prosecutors who were reportedly seeking a five-year jail sentence.\n \n\n \nAccording to the report, the court initially ruled that the founder of Thodex should spend one year and six months behind bars. However, after considering the founder’s reported behavior before and during the trial, the Turkish court eventually ruled that Özer should only be in jail for seven months and 15 days.\n \nMeanwhile, in addition to failing to submit tax documents, Özer is also accused of defrauding investors via his crypto platform. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, the Thodex founder was arrested in Albania several months after he fled from Turkey with $2 billion which belonged to investors.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

Trump also made several other promises, including getting Russia’s President Vladimir Putin to make a deal with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “very quickly.”\n \nDonald Trump’s Warnings\n \nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump made several promises and predictions during an interview with Fox News Sunday. He was asked about his plan to get the U.S. economy growing again and whether he thinks the U.S. is going into a recession. “If people think Trump is going to be elected, you’ll never have a recession … because people will start investing,” the former president claimed, adding:\n \n\nIf people think I’m not, you’ll have more than a recession. You’re going to have a depression.\n \n“But, what I would do is very simple. I’ve got to get interest rates down. We have to get rid of inflation because inflation is a country killer,” he stressed, noting that the Biden administration is “putting the interest rates at a point nobody can borrow.”\n \n \nTrump also made a number of other promises. For example, he said: “We’ll close up the border. We’ll become energy independent, then we’re going to be energy dominant. We’ll be taking care of Europe. Energy prices are going to come down. I will get [Russian President] Putin to make a deal with [Ukrainian President] Zelenskyy very quickly. We’re going to have a great world again.” Moreover, Trump opined: “If we don’t win in ’24, this country is finished. I really believe that.”\n \nIn April, the former president warned that the U.S. dollar is crashing and soon will “no longer be the world standard.” In addition, he cautioned that “we are very close” to a third world war.\n \nWhat do you think about the warnings by former U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the U.S. economy and the dollar?
