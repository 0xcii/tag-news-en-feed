Two assets are said to be “correlated” when their prices move in tandem with each other. Bitcoin has been showing a correlation with the US stock market for a while now, and it seems like this trend hasn’t changed this week either.\n \nThe below chart shows how BTC, Nasdaq, S&P 500, Gold, and DXY have changed in value during the recent volatile events:\n \n\n \n \nAs the above graph displays, all the risk assets observed a rise in the buildup to and after t…",
