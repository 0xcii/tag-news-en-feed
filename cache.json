The blockchain forensics firm believes that to a large extent the trend can be attributed to more of the targeted organizations refusing to pay the perpetrators.\n \nChainalysis Registers Significant Decline in Revenue From Ransomware Attacks\n \nOver the course of 2022, ransomware actors have managed to extort at least $456.8 million from victims, Chainalysis revealed in a report published Thursday. The estimated amount is down from $765.6 million the year before, the analytics company pointed out, noting that the true total is likely much higher, as many crypto addresses controlled by attackers have yet to be identified.\n \n“The trend …",

Chandrasekhar currently serves as both India’s Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology and Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. He is also a member of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament.\n \nHe explained that India has no issue with cryptocurrencies if all laws are followed, Reuters reported, quoting him as saying:\n \n\nThere is nothing today that outlaws crypto as long as you follow the legal process.\n \nThe Indian government has not yet established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. In December last year, the government told parliament that crypto legislation “can be effective only with significant international collaboration.” Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said the government plans to discuss crypto regulations with the G20 countries.\n \nHowever, crypto income is already taxed at 30% in India, and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) is levied on crypto transactions. Earlier this month, the government revealed that it is launching a crypto awareness campaign.\n \nMeanwhile, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has recommended a complete ban on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week that “Cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value,” warning that “it will undermine the authority of the RBI and lead to the dollarization of the economy.” He even expects crypto to cause the next financial crisis if it is not banned.\n \nWhat do you think about the statement by Indian government official Chandrasekhar?
