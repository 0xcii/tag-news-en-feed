Moreover, the now-bankrupt crypto trading platform’s exchange token FTT is still trading above $1 per unit, and it managed to climb 23.4% higher against the U.S. dollar during the past seven days.\n \nFTT Coin Pumps After Crypto Community Members and Sam Bankman-Fried Discuss a New FTT Token Idea\n \nFor some odd reason, the digital asset ftx token (FTT) is still holding value and on Dec. 10, 2022, it’s been trading for prices between $1.58 to $1.82 over the last 24 hours. FTT is an exchange token associated with FTX from the very beginning, and it was launched more than three years ago in 2019.\n \nIn fact, this week FTT’s …",

          "description": "Uniswap was in the green to start the weekend, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly consolidating. The token rebounded from losses suffered on Friday, moving closer to a key resistance level in the process. Dogecoin, on the other hand, fell lower on Saturday as traders attempted to find a stable point of support.\n \nUniswap (UNI)\n \nUniswap (UNI) was one of Saturday’s notable movers, as prices rebounded from declines suffered the day prior.\n \nAfter sinking to a bottom of $6.10 on Friday, UNI/USD marginally rebounded, climbing to a high of $6.27 in the process.\n \nAs a result of this, the token moved closer to a key resistance level of $6.35, which was last hit December 5.\n \n \nIn order to recapture this point, UNI bulls will first need to rise beyond a ceiling of 56.70 on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at a level of 54.75, which has contributed to the current market volatility, with traders unsure if they should maintain previous positions.\n \nHowever, should we see price strength surge beyond the aforementioned resistance at 56.70, then it is possible that UNI bulls could send prices towards the $7.00 mark.\n \n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) on the other hand remained in the red, following a failed breakout of a key resistance point on Friday.\n \nFollowing a move to a high of $0.09858 yesterday, DOGE/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.096 on Saturday.\n \nThe move comes as the meme coin was unable to surge past its ceiling of $0.0990 during Friday’s session.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, this point of resistance coincides with another ceiling — that of the RSI.\n \nAs of writing, the index is currently tracking at 51.96, which is marginally below a ceiling of 53.00.\n \nShould we see this wall broken, it is likely that the meme coin could head back towards the $0.1000 region.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect dogecoin prices to rebound this weekend?

Markets now expect that the Fed could continue hiking rates, following a higher than expected increase in producer prices. Ethereum mainly consolidated on Saturday, as prices moved back towards a key price floor. \n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) remained above the $17,000 level to start the weekend, despite crypto markets mostly consolidating.\n \nBTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $17,100.84 during Saturday’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $17,280.55.\n \nAs a result of today’s decline, BTC continued to move below its recent resistance level of $17,200.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it now appears as if bitcoin could be moving towards a floor of $16,750, which comes as market volatility remains high today.\n \nThe turbulence came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to move between a floor of 50.00 and a ceiling of 52.00.\n \nIn order for bulls to fully regain market sentiment, a breakout of the 52.00 mark must occur, which could then lead to the return of upwards momentum.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nLike bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also consolidated to start the weekend, with price moving close to a key point of support.\n \nFollowing a peak of $1,290.06 on Friday, ETH/USD moved to a bottom of $1,260.82 earlier in the day.\n \nAs a result of today’s drop, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moved closer to a recent floor of $1,230.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it seems that today’s consolidation comes as bulls failed to break out of a resistance point at $1,300.\n \nAs of writing, ethereum now seems as though it is heading for its aforementioned floor at the $1,230 point.\n \nThis comes as the 10-day (red) moving average now appears to have halted recent gains, and is slowly shifting downwards.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill ethereum end the weekend below $1,200?
