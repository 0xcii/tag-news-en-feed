Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase's premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin's all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance. Solana's (SOL) decentralized exchange (DEX) achieves a monthly volume of $50 billion, with revenue soaring 30-fold. OKX announces support for a new Solana token standard. Despite expectations, Layer 2 activity remains sluggish post-Dencun, according to Vitalik Buterin.",

This move is aimed at ensuring maximum issuer participation on the first trading day and allowing issuers sufficient time to prepare their documentation and meet regulatory requirements.\n\"We have decided to launch the market in Crypto ETNs on 28 May 2024 to enable the maximum number of issuers to be present in the market on the first day of trading,\" the notice stated. \"In choosing this date we have taken into consideration that we need to ensure that issuers meet the requirements for consideration detailed in the Crypto ETN factsheet and importantly, it will also enable those issuers planning on admitting securities on the launch date, time to prepare documentation to establish a Crypto ETN programme which will require a base prospectus to be approved by the FCA.\"\nIssuers interested in listing securities on the Main Market on May 28 must submit the necessary information to the Exchange by April 15. This includes details on how the issuer and/or the ETN will meet the requirements outlined in the Crypto ETN factsheet and a draft of the base prospectus highlighting relevant disclosures.\nHowever, issuers failing to meet the specified requirements, submit their applications after April 15, or have their base prospectus unapproved by the FCA by midday on May 22, 2024, will not be eligible to participate in the first day of trading.",
