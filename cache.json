This boosts the country's total bitcoin holdings to 5,750 BTC valued at over $360 million.\n\nJUST IN: 🇸🇻 El Salvador mined nearly 474 #bitcoin worth $29 million using volcano-fueled geothermal power in last three years, Reuters reports. pic.twitter.com/bBACoe9GzM\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 15, 2024\n \n \n \nThe renewable energy mining operation is a collaborative effort between El Salvador and bitcoin mining firms like Foundry USA, Antpool, ViaBTC, F2Pool, and Binance Pool. It utilizes the geothermal power from Tecapa, one of El Salvador's many active volcanoes.\nOf the 102 megawatts generated by the state-owned geothermal power plant beside the volcano, 1.5 megawatts go toward Bitcoin mining. President Nayib Bukele has installed 300 specialized mining processors to facilitate the process.\nEl Salvador made headlines in 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. Despite criticism from the IMF and others, Bukele has remained committed to Bitcoin, with a Bitcoin mining operation powered by volcano-fueled geothermal energy embodying this forward-thinking approach.\n \n                         \n                         \n                        Click the image to learn more. \n                     \n                    \nThe country's mining accomplishments stand in stark contrast to the scrutiny bitcoin miners face worldwide over energy usage. By tapping geothermal energy from Tecapa, El Salvador provides a renewable model for potential adoption elsewhere.\nThe $29 million mined demonstrates the substantial, real-world value unlocked by El Salvador's status as the first Bitcoin nation. As more renewable mining comes online globally, the country's volcanic model provides an ambitious precedent.",

As noted in a recent report by Kaiko, miner revenues have plummeted since the halving, and miners are beginning to feel the pressure. \n \nBitcoin Under Increased Pressure\n \nBitcoin miners largely rely on two revenue streams to keep operating: the mining reward and transaction fees.

          "description": "For investors hoping for a simple way to gain exposure to Ethereum, the road seems paved with regulatory hurdles. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thrown a wrench into plans for spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), leaving the future of these investment vehicles shrouded in uncertainty.\n \n \nSecurity Or Commodity? The Ethereum Classification Conundrum\n \nThe crux of the issue lies in the SEC’s classification of Ethereum (ETH) itself. Bloomberg analysts, including Eric Balchunas, believe the SEC views ETH as a security, not a commodity – and that the chances of its ETF getting the regulator’s nod is “slim to none.”\n \nThis distinction is crucial because commodity ETFs are generally easier to get approved than security ETFs. The SEC’s recent inquiries regarding whether…",

Buckley has been publicly critical of Bitcoin and opposed offering Bitcoin ETF products to clients. \nUnder Buckley's leadership, Vanguard refused to provide its brokerage customers access to U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs that were approved by the SEC.\nThe appointment of Ramji, set to take effect July 8, signals a potential change in Vanguard's stance. As head of BlackRock's iShares division, Ramji oversaw the launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.\nRamji has spoken positively about the technology underpinning Bitcoin and its potential to remove friction in financial markets. \nHis experience pioneering Bitcoin ETFs at BlackRock has many wondering if he will now push for similar offerings at Vanguard.\n \n                         \n                         \n                        Click the image to learn more. \n                     \n                    \nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, bringing in the bitcoin-friendly Ramji means the door is \"much more open now\" for Vanguard to embrace Bitcoin.\nThe company offers index funds and ETFs to both retail and institutional investors. \nAs a massive player in the ETF space with over $7 trillion in global AUM, Vanguard launching a spot bitcoin ETF would be an important milestone for further mainstream adoption.",
