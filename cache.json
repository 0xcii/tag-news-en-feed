What would our daily lives look like under a bitcoin standard? And what would that mean for bitcoin?\nIt would seemingly mean that things would be priced in bitcoin at the store. In other words, bitcoin would function as a unit of account. So, instead of things being priced in U.S. dollars all over the world, things would be priced in…",

          "description": "The Doge father himself, Elon Musk, has breathed new life into the Dogecoin price with a tweet, triggering a 4% spike. The Twitter CEO responded to a popular Dogecoin community member and once again sparked the “Musk effect” for the DOGE price.\n \nHistorically, just about every Dogecoin-related tweet from Musk triggers some increase in the price of DOGE.

Ethereum was also lower on the news, falling below $1,800.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) dropped below $28,000 on Thursday, as markets continued to react to the latest Federal Reserve rate hike.\n \nThe Fed moved to increase rates by 25 basis points, whilst signaling that no cuts will be made this year.\n \nBTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $26,760.00 on the news, which comes a day after trading at a peak of $28,803.34.\n \n \nFrom the chart, the decline appears to have come as a result of the relative strength index (RSI) failing to break out of a ceiling at 72.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 66.54, with the next visible point of support at the 62.00 mark.\n \nOverall, prices are still relatively overbought, which could lead to further bears reentering the market in the coming days.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nIn addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also back in the red on Thursday, with prices moving below $1,800.\n \nFollowing a high of $1,821.46 on Wednesday, ETH/USD declined to a low of $1,717.77 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of the slippage, ethereum neared a recent point of support at the $1,715 mark, however bulls have so far rejected a breakout.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the 10-day (red) moving average remained in an upward trend, which could be a sign of future bullish momentum.\n \nPrice strength is currently tracking at 58.02, which is marginally above a floor at 57.00, resulting in ETH jumping from earlier lows.\n \nAt the time of writing, ethereum is tracking at $1,756.34.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect ethereum to move back above $1,800 this week?
