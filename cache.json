The platform was launched by failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) co-founders last year.\nAnother Failed Crypto Venture\nAccording to a CoinTelegraph report, the exchange emailed its customers, notifying them of the upcoming shutdown. It asked the customers to close all open positions by February 7 and withdraw the funds by February 14. The email further confirmed that the platform will stop all withdrawals after the deadline.\n\"We would like to inform you that OPNX.com will officially cease operations and shut down in February 2024,\" the email read. \"We are dedicated to ensuring an orderly closure for all users.\"\n\"We are deeply thankful to each member of the OPNX community for their dedication and trust. As we conclude this chapter, we cherish the experiences shared and look ahead with gratitude.\"\nTwo Controversial Crypto Entrepreneurs\nSu Zhu and Kyle Davies, the two co-founders of now-collapsed 3AC, launched OPNX, short of the Open Exchange, in April 2023, months after the bankruptcy of the $10 billion crypto hedge fund. The exchange brought a unique hybrid offering to the industry: it allowed traders to trade cryptocurrencies and the claims of several bankrupt crypto platforms, including 3AC.\nZhu and Davis are already in troubled waters with claimants of 3AC and law enforcement. Following the collapse of 3AC, the duo disappeared, forcing Teneo, the firm in charge of liquidating 3AC's assets, to subpoena them via messages on X (formerly Twitter). Teneo is currently seeking $1.3 billion from the two co-founders.\nFurther, over $1.1 billion in assets of Zhu, Davies, and Davies' wife, Kelly Chen, were frozen following a British Virgin Islands court order. Last year, the Singapore police even arrested Zu for not helping in the liquidation process. \n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.",
