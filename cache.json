As per South China Morning Post, users can now directly buy and sell Bitcoin and ether using Hong Kong or US dollars. \n\nJUST IN: 🇭🇰 Hong Kong’s largest online broker Futu has launched #Bitcoin and crypto trading. pic.twitter.com/sGDxbx83is\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 1, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nFutu is the first online broker in Hong Kong to offer direct Bitcoin access to retail investors. Last month, the company received approval from the city's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to provide virtual asset dealing services.\nThe move comes as Hong Kong approved a Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund earlier this year. With a new licensing regime for exchanges and other policy initiatives, Hong Kong aims to position itself as a Bitcoin and crypto hub. \nBy allowing retail Bitcoin trading on its main app, Futu is leapfrogging rivals. It has also applied for a full Bitcoin and crypto exchange license for its PantherTrade platform, one of 11 \"deemed licensed\" interim exchanges in Hong Kong awaiting SFC approval.\nTo attract new Bitcoin and crypto users, Futu is offering incentives like Alibaba and Nvidia stock as rewards. Customers who deposit HK$10,000 for 60 days get HK$600 of Bitcoin or vouchers and shares. Bigger depositors can earn more rewards.\nFutu is also waiving Bitcoin trading commissions for now to gain market share. It is partnering with licensed exchange HashKey to enable trading under SFC rules.\nBy leveraging its large client base, Futu can uniquely drive significant retail volume for Bitcoin trading in Hong Kong. Its brand name gives its Bitcoin platform instant credibility and trust.",

This tops the previous record of 657 EH/s set on May 26th.\n \n                         \n                         \n                         \n                     \n                    \nThis new all time high comes as Donald Trump announced his plans during the conference to support and boost the Bitcoin mining industry. \nMajor mining firms like Whatsminer and MicroBT are rolling out new powerful machines to capitalize on the hash rate boom. Whatsminer unveiled four new mining rigs and an upcoming solar mining container system. MicroBT introduced its M6XS+ miners, which can handle 190 to 450 terahash.\nRiot Platforms also acquired Block Mining for $92.5 million to expand its hash rate and market reach. Miners are exploring AI integration and acquisition opportunities to navigate ongoing identity challenges.\nThe boost in miners' revenue from Bitcoin's rising price has cooled selling pressure and stabilized network activity. Outflows from miners remained under $10,000 per day in July compared to over $20,000 in March when BTC first hit $70,000.\nOverall, Bitcoin's climbing hashrate reflects a vote of confidence in its long-term viability. With major mining innovations and favourable politics boosting revenues, miners are aggressively expanding infrastructure to process transactions and secure the Bitcoin network.",

          "description": "According to Bitcoin Magazine Pro, the 7-day average mining hash rate for Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high, surpassing 667 exahashes per second (EH/s) on July 26th during the Bitcoin 2024 conference. This tops the previous record of 657 EH/s set on May 26th.\n \n                         \n                         \n                         \n                     \n                    \nThe hash rate refers to the total computational power miners dedicate to processing transactions and mining new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. A higher hash rate means greater competition among miners to validate blocks, making the network more resistant to manipulation or attack.\nMajor mining firms like Whatsminer and MicroBT are rolling out new powerful machines to capitalize on the hash rate boom. Whatsminer unveiled four new mining rigs and an upcoming solar mining container system. MicroBT introduced its M6XS+ miners, which can handle 190 to 450 terahash.\nRiot Platforms also acquired Block Mining for $92.5 million to expand its hash rate and market reach. Miners are exploring AI integration and acquisition opportunities to navigate ongoing identity challenges.\nThe boost in miners' revenue from Bitcoin's rising price has cooled selling pressure and stabilized network activity. Outflows from miners remained under $10,000 per day in July compared to over $20,000 in March when BTC first hit $70,000.\nOverall, Bitcoin's climbing hashrate reflects a vote of confidence in its long-term viability. With major mining innovations and favourable politics boosting revenues, miners are aggressively expanding infrastructure to process transactions and secure the Bitcoin network.",
