Thirty-two-year-old Wahi from Washington bagged the jail  \nterm for tipping off his brother and friend on multiple occasions with  \nconfidential information about Coinbase’s upcoming token listings.\nWith the  \ninformation, Wahi’s brother, Nikhil, and friend, Sameer Ramani made  \nover $1.1 million from trading ahead of Coinbase’s public announcements,  \naccording to the US securities regulator which filed charges against  \nthe three individuals in July last year. \nCoinbase Former Employee Pleads Guilty\nThe US  \nDepartment of Justice announced Wahi's fate on Tuesday, noting that he was  \nsentenced by US District Judge Loretta Preska. However, prosecutors did not  \ncomment on the fate of Nikhil and Ramani.\nThe  \nsentence comes over three months after Wahi pleaded guilty to two counts of  \nconspiracy to commit wire fraud. The confession contradicts the former Coinbase staffer's claim in 2022 that he was not guilty of wrongdoing. \n“Today’s  \nsentence should send a strong signal to all participants in the cryptocurrency  \nmarkets that the laws decidedly do apply to them,” said Damian Williams, the US  \nAttorney for the Southern District of New York. \n\"[The district] will  \nhold those who engage in insider trading to full account, regardless of whether  \ntheir illegal conduct occurs in the equity markets or in the market for crypto  \nassets,\" added Williams.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Solomon Oladipupo at www.financemagnates.com.",

Users can go to any Canadian Post office, scan the QR code generated on the Bull Bitcoin app, and pay in cash or via debit card.\n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \nThe funds are automatically added to the user's Bull Bitcoin account within a few minutes. Transactions of up to ~$745 ($999.99 CAD) can be made per transaction, with no KYC required. The exchange has a fee of 2% for no-KYC sats, the cheapest of any such service in Canada, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, while Bull Bitcoin's on-chain withdrawals remain free.\nCanadian regulations state that Bitcoin exchanges must perform KYC and keep transaction records for all purchases above $1,000 CAD. Bull Bitcoin states that its privacy policy complies with the fair information principles in the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act (PIPEDA), which prevents it from collecting information that is not needed for a legitimate purpose. \nWith no risk of chargeback for cash and debit card transactions, the company states that it has no legitimate reason to ask for KYC.\nBull Bitcoin aims to offer cash bitcoin purchases due to customer demand, and for those without access to bank accounts. The company also aims to attract migrant workers for remittances and users who want to limit the amount of personal information they give to trusted third parties. In addition, cash and debit card transactions are not subject to fraudulent chargebacks, unlike bank transfers and e-transfers. The process of funding accounts with cash or debit cards is also faster and more convenient.",
