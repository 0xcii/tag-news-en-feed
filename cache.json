The token surged for a second straight session, after snapping a three-day losing streak on Tuesday. Cosmos also surged higher in today’s session, as it moved closer to recent highs.\n \nPolygon (MATIC)\n \nPolygon (MATIC) extended a recent rally on Wednesday, with prices jumping to a ten-month high.\n \nFollowing a low of $1.22 on Tuesday, MATIC/USD raced to an intraday high of $1.31 in today’s session.\n \nToday’s move saw MATIC/USD climb to its strongest point since April 26, 2022, when the token was at a high of $1.36.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, the surge in price sent the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) to a long-term resistance point of 71.00.\n \nSo far, bullish momentum has not been strong enough to pass this zone, with the index now tracking at 69.83.\n \nShould a breakout occur over the coming days, it is likely that traders will target a ceiling at $1.35.\n \n \nCosmos (ATOM)\n \nAnother notable mover on hump day was cosmos (ATOM), which also closed in on a recent multi-month high.\n \nATOM/USD ascended to a peak of $15.18 earlier in the day, which comes after trading at a low of $14.32 on Tuesday.\n \nThis resulted in ATOM moving closer to a long-term resistance level at $15.20, and not far from last Friday’s high at $15.44.\n \n \nThe aforementioned top was the strongest point that cosmos had hit since November 5, and it appears as though bulls are looking to recapture this.\n \nAs of writing, the RSI is tracking at 64.23, and in order to achieve the above, a move beyond an upcoming ceiling of 65.00 must occur.\n \nOverall momentum still seems to be bullish, with further higher highs possible as the session progresses.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect cosmos to move above $15.44 this week?
