The facility in Montana was designed to have up to 100-megawatts of power, according to the filing.\nMarathon’s stock price has been volatile in recent months, reflecting the ups and downs of the bitcoin market, however, the stock has generally followed an upward trend since early 2021, as the value of bitcoin has risen.",

          "description": "Former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark has issued a warning about Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin emitter, USDT. In his opinion, Tether could be the next domino to fall, and its promise of transparency and audits may not be enough to prevent that from happening.\n \nIs Tether’s Future In Jeopardy?\n \nStark, who has 35 years of experience studying markets and financial statements, including 18 years as an attorney in the SEC Enforcement Division, believes that Tether is a “mammoth house of cards” that could collapse at any moment. He argues that the company’s lack of transparency and its opaque relationship with its banking partners create significant risks for investors and the wider financial system.\n \nRelated Reading: Bitcoin Investors Turn To Lit…",

But the community consensus model of Bitcoin is essential for ongoing censorship resistance. While it’s not easy to get tens of thousands of individual computers to agree, getting thousands of humans to agree is arguably the greater challenge.”\nAs a Bitcoin Core developer, Uttarwar is understandably fascinated with Bitcoin’s unique consensus model.

Cardano was also marginally higher.\n \nLitecoin (LTC)\n \nLitecoin (LTC) jumped back above $80.00 earlier in today’s session, as the token continued to move away from recent lows.\n \nFollowing yesterday’s low of $78.18, LTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $81.97 on Thursday.\n \nThe surge saw litecoin rise from a recent six-week low of $75.32, which took the cryptocurrency to a breakout of a floor at $77.00.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, today’s rally pushed the relative strength index (RSI) towards a resistance level of 39.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is currently tracking at 37.95, with LTC falling from earlier highs, and trading at $80.84.\n \nBulls in the market are likely targeting a ceiling of $85.00, however there will likely be some hurdles in the form upcoming points of resistance.\n \n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) was also marginally higher, as prices traded close to a key support level on Wednesday.\n \nADA/USD hit a high of $0.3727 earlier in the day, which comes following a bottom at $0.3574 during yesterday’s session.\n \nThursday’s marginal gain sees cardano climb above a price floor of $0.3580, however earlier momentum has somewhat faded.\n \n \nIt appears that gains have eased due to the RSI colliding with a ceiling at the 41.00 mark.\n \nPrice strength is now at the 37.06 level, after failing to break out of the aforementioned resistance.\n \nADA is now trading at $0.3613, with bearish pressure significantly higher than earlier in the day.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould cardano fall further this week?
