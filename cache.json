          "description": "“Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin did not appear out of nothing. For decades prior to Satoshi Nakamoto introducing his invention, a diverse group of computer scientists, privacy activists, and heterodox economists tried to create a digital form of money that could operate independently of government control. The Genesis Book tells the story of the people and projects that inspired the invention of the world's first successful peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” \n-Cover Sypnosis\n\nAaron van Wirdum’s long awaited book goes through the pre-history of everything that led up to the creation of Bitcoin. So many individual ideas and concepts went into the creation of Bitcoin that people tend to forget the history of those pieces before Satoshi glued them together into the Bitcoin protocol we know today. \nThe Genesis Book gives the readers a long walk through the history of both the people and cultural movements spawned out of the early rise of the hacker community, and how these cultural movements and their respective ethoses shaped the technologies themselves that were produced. The ethos and mentality of the members of early counter-culture groups like the cypherpunks and extropians laid the ideological foundation of the cultures we see thriving in Bitcoin today. \nThese same people also laid the technical foundations Bitcoin itself was built upon, through early attempts at digital cash systems like David Chaum’s ecash, to Wei Dai’s b-money. Concepts like Adam Back’s Hashcash and Hal Finney’s Reusable Proof of Work (RPOW) also began the slow road towards Bitcoin’s proof of work consensus system. \nFor anyone who wants to truly understand the pre-history of Bitcoin, and the people and technological inventions that laid the groundwork for Satoshi’s gift to us, this book is a must read. \n\nThe book is available for pre-order here, with shipments expected to go out starting on January 3rd, 2024.",

The relevant indicator here is the “exchange netflow volume,” which keeps track of the net amount of Bitcoin entering into or exiting the wallets of a given centralized exchange.\n \nWhen the value of this metric is negative, it means that the exchange is seeing outflows of a net number of coins right now.

As the 4th Halving nears and the block reward trims to 3.125 bitcoin per block, miners must not only adapt to a significantly diminished reward, but contend with an increasingly profit-hostile future which might have surprised even the prescient Nakamoto. Indeed, despite widespread hope that fiat states will come to accept peaceful coexistence with bitcoin—I, too, would prefer this outcome—and despite some modest grounds for optimism, history would remind us that kings and emperors do not willingly relinquish power.
