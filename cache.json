          "description": "Considering the recent FTX collapse that triggered higher volatility in the crypto market, the world’s jurisdictions are revamping their crypto regulation framework. The EU remains at the end of the race by delaying voting on its crypto regulations bill known as MiCA. \n \nNotably, it was the second time the much-awaited bill, Markets in Crypto Regulations (MiCA), has been delayed. The parliament postponed the voting from November 2022 to February 2023 and now deferred it until April 2023. European legislators attributed translation issues as a reason behind both delays. \n \n \nThe proposed EU regulations consist of a 380-page document that must be translated into all 24 languages spoken on the continent. The crypto regulation was initially drafted in English and will be published in all langu…",
