Larsen explained that the team successfully persuaded crypto exchanges to promptly freeze the affected addresses.\n \n$112.5 Million Transferred From Chris Larsen’s Accounts\n \nIn the realm of social media, specifically within the X community, there is a growing fervor surrounding a substantial transfer of XRP from Chris Larsen’s XRP accounts. The initial revelation came from onchain analyst Zachxbt, who swiftly shared the information, stating, “It appears Ripple was hacked for ~213M XRP ($112.5M).” This development ignited a wave of intense speculation and discussion across various social media platforms.\n \nLarsen addressed the situation on X and said that his personal xrp accounts were affected. “Yesterday, there was unauthorized access to a few of my personal XRP accounts (not Ripple) – we were quickly able to catch the problem and notify exchanges to freeze the affected addresses,” Larsen said. “Law enforcement is already involved,” the Ripple executive added.\n \n \nXRP initially dropped 5% on the news against the U.S. dollar and 24-hour statistics as of 10:40 p.m. Eastern Time, show XRP is down 3.5%. Of course, many speculators are wondering what happened with Larsen’s account and how the actors were able to access 213 million XRP from his stash. As of right now, it is a compelling mystery until more answers come out.\n \nWhat do you think about the Ripple exec’s xrp stash being pilfered? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.",

          "description": "Blockchain payment firm Ripple has recently experienced a significant security breach, resulting in the loss of a substantial amount of XRP. \n \nThe hack, uncovered by decentralized finance (DeFi) detective ZachXBT, has raised serious concerns about the protocol’s security and triggered a series of illicit transactions involving the stolen XRP. \n \nXRP Hack Rocks Ripple\n \nAccording to investigations, the hack led to the theft of over 213 million XRP, valued at over $112 million. The stolen funds were subsequently laundered through cryptocurrency exchanges, including MEXC, Gate, Binance, Kraken, OKX, HTX, HitBTC, and several undisclosed platforms. \n \n \nAs seen in the image below, the criminals behind the security breach conducted eight transactions to different addresses, as revealed by the blockchain.\n \n \nXRP Price Dips Further After Hack\n \nFollowing the security breach, XRP’s price plummeted to $0.5070 and continued to decline further, hitting a low of $0.4860 on Wednesday. \n \nThe hack news intensified the token’s downward trend, which has already experienced a 19% decline over the past 30 days and a 4% decline in the past 24 hours. \n \n \nThe next steps that Ripple will take to address the security breach remain uncertain. The company’s response to the situation and measures to fortify its security infrastructure will be closely monitored. \n \nAs of this writing, Ripple officials have not released any official statements regarding the hack, leaving the situation in a critical state. \n \n \nAs seen on the 1-day chart of XRP, the next major support for the token is placed at the $0.4876 level, which prevented a further decline after the news was released. If this level fails to hold a potential continuation of the downtrend, the next support for the token is placed at $0.4686.\n \nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",

However, Wen defended her actions and said she thought Zhang had accumulated her wealth through her jewelry business, property portfolio, and bitcoin mining operation. \n \nZhang’s Wealth Management Business\n \nA British-Chinese woman, Jian Wen, is on trial in the U.K. for allegedly laundering bitcoins that were sourced with $6.3 billion stolen from more than 128,000 investors in China. According to prosecutors, Wen is facing three charges of laundering money on behalf of the Chinese national Yadi Zhang.\n \nZhang, a fugitive from justice, is said to have perpetrated the grand fraud via her bogus wealth management business between 2014 and 2017. Afterwards, she reportedly converted some of the stolen money to bitcoin (BTC) before leaving for London under a false identity.\n \nUpon arriving in the U.K., Zhang sought the services of Wen to convert her BTC into cash, jewellery, and other luxury items. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) alleges that Zhang’s ultimate objective was “to disguise the true source of the funds.”\n \n \nDuring the trial, Gillian Jones, who represented the CPS, stated that while Wen was not involved in the fraud, she may have known that Zhang’s bitcoins were proceeds from criminal activity. Jones urged the jury to ask Wen if she was aware of Zhang’s criminal activities.\n \nThe lawyer argued that Wen, a naturalized British citizen, knowingly acted as a front for Zhang and was probably paid for it. However, Wen defended her actions and said she thought Zhang had accumulated her wealth through her jewellery business, property portfolio, and bitcoin mining operation.\n \nThe trial is expected to run until early March, according to the report.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

This paves the way for 2025 de facto EU bans on BTC & BTC mining.”\n \nAccording to Batten, this move by the European Commission is part of a broader strategy that has global implications.
