Reaching this price level would be a new all-time high for SHIB, but there are a number of factors that will drive the growth needed to reach it.\n \nShiba Inu Needs Demand\n \nThe Shiba Inu price, as with other cryptocurrencies, is highly dependent on the demand to supply ratio. When there is more supply than demand, the price tends to suffer. However, when demand surpasses supply, it leads to a surge in price, which is why demand for the SHIB token is important.\n \n \nSome indicators of rising demand include a rise in the trading volume and in the last 24 hours, the SHIB daily trading volume is up over 33% to reach $2.1 billion.

However, as time progresses, the coin is inching closer to the “Danger Zone.” Usually, when prices are at this region, as past price action shows, the coin tends to pull back sharply, unwinding gains.
