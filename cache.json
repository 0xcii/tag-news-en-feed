The relevant indicator here is the “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD), which, to understand the concept of “coin days,” needs to be looked at first.\n \nA coin day is a quantity that 1 BTC accumulates when it remains dormant on the blockchain for 1 day. When any coin that has remained dormant for some number of days, and hence, has accumulated some coin days, is finally transferred on the network, its coin days counter naturally resets back to zero.\n \nThe coin…",

In the coming weeks, the model will be open-sourced, the release stated, and the entire Bitcoin community will be engaged to assist in training and fine-tuning it. The project also plans to offer sats bounties to incentivize participation.\nBy providing an alternative system and powerful tools, The Spirit of Satoshi project said it aims to combat potential threats such as “Iris Scanning Central Bank Digital Currencies” (CBDCs), mainstream education limitations and generalized AI that restricts knowledge within narrow boundaries.\nTo learn more about The Spirit of Satoshi and contribute to its mission, interested individuals can visit SpiritofSatoshi.ai.",
