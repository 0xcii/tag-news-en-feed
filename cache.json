          "description": "In a compelling tale of persistence and financial prudence, a Reddit user embarked on a unique investment experiment, demonstrating the potential rewards of consistently investing small amounts, or dollar cost averaging, into Bitcoin. \nThe Redditor, going by the handle u/Gorillahair2000, initiated an experiment to determine whether allocating just $5 per day into Bitcoin was a worthwhile endeavor, and over the course of one full year, diligently recorded their progress.\nAfter 365 days of investing $5 per day, the Redditor accumulated a total stack of 0.075 Bitcoin. The average purchase price stood at $24,108.58, while the current price of Bitcoin was $34,158.20. \nThe total expenditure over the year amounted to $1,825.00, and the current value of the investment was $2,585.75, yielding a net change of +41.68%.\nThe Redditor also noted that they accounted for the 0.5-1.0% spread on each of their purchases, meaning the gains remained after adjusting for fees. The user indicated that they buy with Strike, a popular Bitcoin Lightning wallet, and then withdraw the Bitcoin to a hardware wallet, in line with industry best practices.\nIn a year's time, they transformed the daily expense equivalent to a Starbucks coffee into $2,500 in current value, or a $750 gain.\nThe experiment proves that even with a modest budget, investing in Bitcoin can yield significant returns, and it further demonstrates the power of dollar-cost averaging, a strategy that involves consistently purchasing assets at fixed intervals, regardless of their price, thereby mitigating the effects of market volatility.\nFurther, it also highlights Bitcoin's main advantages as a sound money, one that doesn't depreciate like traditional savings vehicles tied to inflationary fiat currencies.",

Its counterpart, Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), is also reportedly making notable strides into web3 and the cryptocurrency space. Both banks are vying to offer a full spectrum of crypto services permissible within the regulatory framework in Thailand.\nSCB had earlier this year attempted a similar acquisition of a regional rival, though it was notably stalled over regulatory issues.\nKasikorn Bank has set an ambitious goal to capture 20% of the cryptocurrency market share in Thailand by the year 2024, marking its commitment notable at a time when many global banks remain on the sector's sidelines.",
