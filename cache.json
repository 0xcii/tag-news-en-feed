Insiders also emphasize that Salame’s privately owned aircraft may be surrendered as part of the suspected plea deal.\n \nPrivate Jet on the Bargaining Table as FTX’s Salame Discusses Plea Deal\n \nBloomberg’s Ava Benny-Morrison quotes sources who say Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX, could be negotiating a settlement with federal prosecutors concerning the collapse of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange.\n \nIndividuals in the know stated that Salame might enter a plea agreement as early as the upcoming month. Former FTX leader Sam Bankman-Fried is scheduled for trial in October after pleading not guilty to the charges against him.\n \nSeveral colleagues have already reached plea agreements with federal prosecutors, including FTX co-founder Gary Wang, former FTX director of engineering Nishad Singh, and ex-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison.\n \nIn late April, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents searched Salame’s Maryland residence and confiscated his cell phone. Reports also indicate that Salame snitched on Bankman-Fried days before FTX declared bankruptcy.\n \n \nThe report by Benny-Morrison further specifies that prosecutors aim to confiscate some luxury assets acquired by FTX senior staff during the company’s peak. Sources mentioned by Benny-Morrison reveal that law enforcement is keen on having Salame forfeit his private jet.\n \nThese individuals indicated that the aircraft may play a role in the plea bargain negotiations. The report noted that messages seeking comment from Salame’s lawyers were not immediately returned.\n \nHow do you perceive the potential forfeiture of luxury assets, including Salame’s private jet, in the ongoing legal saga surrounding FTX’s collapse?
