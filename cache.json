It is now tracking at 58.61.\n \nBulls will likely remain unsatisfied until they take ethereum back above $1,700, which hasn’t happened since the end of August.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill ethereum extend this rally into the weekend?
