The meme coin moved higher for a fifth straight session, despite the cryptocurrency market falling by 1.54% as of writing. Avalanche also climbed, hitting a two-month high.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) rose by as much as 6% on Monday, as prices surged for a fifth consecutive session.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.08858 on Sunday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.0946 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move saw dogecoin close in on a key resistance at the $0.0960 level, which was last hit on April 5.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, one of the catalysts of today’s surge in price was a breakout that occurred on the relative strength index (RSI).\n \nAt the time of writing, price strength has moved beyond a ceiling at the 61.00 mark, and is tracking at 62.87\n \nAn upcoming wall at 65.00 could be a hurdle for current bulls. However, should they overcome this, there is a good chance that DOGE moves back above $0.1000.\n \n \nAvalanche (AVAX)\n \nIn addition to DOGE, avalanche (AVAX), was another notable gainer in the market to start the week.\n \nAVAX/USD climbed to an intraday high of $21.011 on Monday, following a low of $19.04 during Sunday’s session.\n \nAs a result of Monday’s surge in price, avalanche has hit its highest point since Feb. 22.\n \n \nThis has resulted in the token briefly breaking out of a point of resistance at $20.90, however gains have since slipped.\n \nIt appears that momentum was caught short following the RSI colliding with its own ceiling at the 73.00 mark.\n \nAlthough the index is now tracking at 73.17, earlier bulls seem to be more tentative, and are moving to secure gains.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCan avalanche move above $22.00 in the coming week?
