Zhu received a four-month prison sentence for failing to cooperate in the bankruptcy proceedings, Teneo revealed.\n \nCrackdown at Changi Airport: 3AC’s Su Zhu Detained, Associate Kyle Davies Fugitive\n \nTeneo, overseeing the liquidation of Three Arrows Capital, reported that co-founder Su Zhu was seized and sentenced to four months’ incarceration. His associate, Kyle Davies, remains at large; however, Teneo confirmed he was given an identical penalty.\n \nZhu allegedly tried to flee Singapore when he was intercepted at Changi Airport, situated approximately 25 miles east of Singapore’s Downtown Core. The Singapore court decreed that Zhu and Davies had not been collaborating with the liquidation procedure – an issue previously reported by the media months prior to his apprehension.\n \n \nThe defunct Singapore-based cryptocurrency hedge fund once supervised over $10 billion in assets at its height. However, a confluence of perilous trading tactics, Terra’s collapse, and plummeting cryptocurrency values obliterated the firm’s assets. Consequently, 3AC declared bankruptcy and was mandated to liquidate by a British Virgin Islands court on June 27, 2022.\n \nSquawk Box posted on X that Kyle Davies, the co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, was asked if he was in Bali because Indonesia is one of seven countries that will not extradite him to the United States. While that interview was in November 2022, Davies is believed to be still in Bali.\n \nWhat do you think about the 3AC co-founder’s arrest?
