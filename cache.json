Riot Platforms and the Texas Blockchain Council sued to seek an injunction against the survey in Waco, Texas. \nIn the final agreement the EIA voluntarily agreed to terminate the collection under the emergency and destroy all information they had received up to the point of the court ruling. \nA new notice was issued following the normal procedure of an open comment period. \nToday at 12:00-1:30 PM Central the EIA is holding a webinar to discuss the issues related to Bitcoin mining energy use, and information associated with mining sites’ operations in the United States. \nPeople can register here to watch the webinar, and there is a form to submit questions during the registration process to hopefully be addressed during the webinar. \nI would ask as I have in past coverage of the agency's actions related to this space, if you do attend and submit any questions, please be respectful and serious in your engagement.",
