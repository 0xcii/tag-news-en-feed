Since 2014, Bitwage has focused on bringing transparency and efficiency to global workforce payments.\nBitcoin and crypto payroll platform Bitwage announced it now serves over 4,500 registered companies and 90,000 registered users that leverage its services to pay employee salaries in Bitcoin and stablecoins.\nBitwage allows companies and individuals to send and receive payments using Bitcoin and crypto. This provides an alternative to traditional payroll and bank wire services.\nThere is a growing demand among employees and employers to utilize Bitcoin for payroll. For remote workers paid by international clients, receiving salaries in Bitcoin can avoid costly foreign exchange fees and delays. Meanwhile, paying contractors in Bitcoin can save companies money compared to bank wires. Bitwage handles the conversion process seamlessly on both ends.\nBitwage is on track to process over $400 million in payroll transactions this year. The company has also raised $3 million in funding from investors like Tim Draper, who said Bitwage \"have been trailblazers in Bitcoin & Stablecoin integrated global payroll.\"\nAccording to Bitwage CEO Jonathan Chester, the company's core mission is to promote financial freedom through innovative payroll solutions. After 10 years at the intersection of payroll and crypto, Bitwage aims to keep improving global workforce payments.",

          "description": "US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded their sixth straight day of net inflows on August 23rd, totalling around $65 million. The sustained run of positive flows highlights the growing institutional demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure.\nBlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) let the days inflow with $75.5 million. Launched in April 2024, IBIT has quickly become the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF, with over $20 billion in assets under management.\nFidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust took in another $9.2 million, while the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF saw inflows of $7.8 million. Smaller spot bitcoin ETFs like VanEck's and WisdomTree's also added several million each.\nHowever, Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust continued to bleed funds with $28.4 million in outflows as investors migrated to cheaper options. GBTC has lost over $20 billion since converting to an ETF structure in 2024.\nWith assets under management crossing $20 billion, BlackRock's IBIT has attracted major investments from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and pension funds. Its rise has cemented Bitcoin ETFs' spot as a gateway for institutional capital.\nOverall, US spot bitcoin ETFs have seen a cumulative $250 million enter the products this week amid a resurgent Bitcoin market. The uninterrupted inflow streak signals strengthening institutional conviction after months of tepid interest.",
