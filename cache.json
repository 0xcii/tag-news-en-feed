He highlighted the appeal of a spot ETF, which would allow investors to gain direct exposure to the underlying asset, unlike futures-based ETFs currently available in the market.\n\"Everyone acknowledges Bitcoin is not a security, including the regulators,\" said Farley. \"Money will flood into the industry with a Bitcoin ETF, it's just easy to buy it. People believe in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a great invention. It is a store of value.\"\n\n\n\nFarley, who recently spearheaded Bullish's acquisition of CoinDesk, expressed confidence in Bitcoin's long-term potential, predicting a substantial inflow of capital into the market once a spot ETF receives regulatory approval. He cited the increasing interest among institutional investors and the broader financial community in gaining access to Bitcoin through traditional investment vehicles.\n\"This guy ran the New York Stock Exchange, he's all in on Bitcoin and crypto now,\" said co-anchor of CNBC's Squawk Box Joe Kernen. \"They use that as credibility for the asset class.\"\nAs the industry eagerly awaits the SEC's decision, the former head of the NYSE's bullish sentiment echoes the growing confidence in Bitcoin's future trajectory, signaling the potential for a significant influx of capital into the market upon the approval of a spot ETF.",

This substantial outflow of funds from Binance occurred shortly after the settlement. As of the latest update, Binance’s diverse array of digital currencies amounts to a total value of $64.98 billion.\n \nPost-DOJ Settlement, Binance Faces $1.7 Billion Crypto Exodus, Nansen Data Reveals\n \nIn the aftermath of the agreement with the DOJ, Binance has seen a noticeable decrease in its crypto holdings, with Nansen highlighting these movements on Wednesday.\n \nWithin just a 12-hour window on Wednesday, the exchange reported a decrease of $17 million in ethereum (ETH) and, within a 24-hour timeframe, a staggering $956 million worth of various prominent cryptocurrencies exited Binance.\n \n \nBy 10:11 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, the total withdrawals from Binance had reached $1.7 billion, according to Nansen.\n \nAt noon the same day, the exchange’s reserves stood at $64.98 billion.
