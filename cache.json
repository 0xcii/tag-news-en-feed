It is widely expected that the Fed will increase rates by 25 basis points, after holding off on hiking last month. Ethereum also remained mostly unchanged.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin started today’s session largely unchanged, as traders anticipated the latest Federal Reserve rate decision.\n \nFollowing a low of $29,097.47 on Tuesday, BTC/USD marginally rose to a high of $29,382.11 earlier today.\n \nThis move saw the cryptocurrency consolidate around a support point at the $29,100 mark, which was last fully broken on June 21.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nAnother floor was hit in today’s session, as the relative strength index (RSI) collided with the 42.00 zone.\n \n \nPrice strength has since rebounded, and at the time of writing this is tracking at a reading of 42.09.\n \nShould the index remain above this level after today’s rate decision, there is a good chance that BTC could move back towards $30,000.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nAdditionally, ethereum (ETH) also consolidated on Wednesday, trading close to a key price floor at $1,850.\n \nETH/USD peaked at $1,867.32 earlier in today’s session, before slipping to a current day’s low of $1,849.44.\n \nThe decline came as the 10-day (red) moving average extended its downward crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nA key area to pay attention to is the floor at 45.00 on the RSI. The index is currently hovering around this mark, however a breakout could result in further declines.\n \n \nIn the event this occurs, the next visible support level to pay attention to will be the 40.00 zone.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you believe the Fed should stop hiking rates?
