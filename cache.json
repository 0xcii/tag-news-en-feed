The court’s ruling followed extradition requests forwarded by the U.S. and South Korea.\n \nMarija Rakovic, the Podgorica High Court’s spokeswoman, revealed on Dec. 12 that Do Kwon’s custody term is now set to end on Feb. 15, 2024. The decision to prolong the Terraform Labs founder’s term in custody comes just a few weeks after the High Court ruled in favor of his extradition.\n \n \nAs reported by Bitcoin.com News, Do Kwon had agreed to be extradited to his native country, South Korea. However, since there were multiple requests for his extradition, the Podgorica High Court ultimately deferred the decision to determine Do Kwon’s next destination to Montenegro’s Justice Minister.\n \nHowever, a Wall Street Journal report on Dec. 7 citing unnamed sources said that the Justice Minister is leaning toward extraditing the ex-Terraform Labs CEO to the United States. Do Kwon’s legal representatives have reportedly appealed against the High Court’s extradition ruling. According to Rakovic, the appellate court, also located in Podgorica, is currently considering Do Kwon’s appeal.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
