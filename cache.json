          "description": "Bitcoin rose to a fresh one-year high on Thursday, as markets reacted to the release of June’s FOMC minutes. The report on last month’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed that “almost all participants” are in favor of further hikes this year. Ethereum also rebounded following the minutes.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) climbed higher on Thursday, as traders continued to react to the latest FOMC minutes report.\n \nThe minutes revealed that “Almost all participants noted that in their economic projections that they judged that additional increases in the target federal funds rate during 2023 would be appropriate.”\n \nBTC/USD rose to an intraday peak at $31,460.05, which comes following a low at $30,225.61 earlier in today’s session.\n \n \nAs a result of this high, BTC rose to its strongest point since last June, when the price was trading above $32,000.\n \nBulls appear to be once again targeting this point, however will first need to break out of a ceiling at $31,500.\n \nSo far they have been unable to do this, pushing the price to a current level at $30,750.56.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) briefly rose in today’s session, however has since slipped, as market momentum began to shift.\n \nFollowing an earlier high at $1,956.01, ETH/USD has dropped to a bottom at $1,909.66 at the time of writing.\n \nThe downturn came as traders once again failed to breach a key resistance level at the $1,960 mark.\n \n \nThis came as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to break a ceiling at the 61.00 level, earlier in the week.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 55.43, and seems to be heading for a floor at the 53.00 mark.\n \nShould it reach this point, there is a good chance that the ETH will be trading below $1,890.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat is behind today’s change in momentum?

Since then, central banks around the world have started operating a fiat-based monetary system with floating exchange rates and no currency standards at all. The money supply has been rising steadily ever since. This forced market participants to look for ways to invest their money to protect against this inflation and one of the most popular investment assets has been real estate. \nIn the past, people owned real estate for its utility value, which is characterized by the fact that you can live on it or …",
