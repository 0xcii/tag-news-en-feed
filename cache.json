          "description": "The German government has transferred millions in seized Bitcoin to major Bitcoin and crypto exchanges Kraken and Coinbase, according to blockchain analysis firm Arkham.\nThe transfers originated from a wallet connected to the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). In 2013, the BKA seized almost 50,000 Bitcoin, from a film piracy website.\nOn Tuesday, the BKA wallet moved $24 million in Bitcoin across two transactions to Kraken and Coinbase. An additional $30 million in Bitcoin was sent to an unknown wallet not affiliated with an exchange.\nArkham data shows that these transfers follow previous movements of $195 million in Bitcoin to exchanges on June 19 and 20. Over $425 million has been shifted in the past week.\nWhile the German government still holds the majority of the seized Bitcoin, the transfers to exchanges may signal an intent to liquidate some of the assets.\nSelling government-held Bitcoin introduces potential downward price pressure. However, the amounts moved so far represent a relatively small portion of daily Bitcoin trading volume. \nNonetheless, Bitcoin dipped below $60,000 on Tuesday amid this news. The German government's Bitcoin wallet still holds over 46,000 Bitcoin worth nearly $3 billion. \nFor German police, the Bitcoin seized from illegal activities has dramatically increased in value. Selling even a fraction provides an unexpected windfall. However, concerns about potential impacts on the broader Bitcoin market remain.",

With the UK launch, Strike is now available in 100 countries worldwide. \nJack Mallers said they are committed to growing Bitcoin adoption and providing its services globally despite regulatory complexities. \"Our work is far from done,\" he added.\nTo use Strike in the UK, users must pass an \"appropriateness assessment\" quiz about Bitcoin, which is required under local regulations. The app also includes customary risk warnings.\nStrike offers several features for UK customers, including buying Bitcoin with instant bank transfers, setting recurring purchases, and self-custody withdrawals.\nThe app also utilizes Lightning Network to enable instant, unlimited, and free payments globally between Strike users, providing a frictionless transnational transfer experience.\nWhile Strike said some companies have exited the UK market, its expansion reflects a belief in Bitcoin's potential. The UK presents opportunities as the world's 6th largest economy.\nStrike continues working to make Bitcoin accessible for regular users and businesses worldwide.
