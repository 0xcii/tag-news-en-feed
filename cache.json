In a recent article, the American political scientist and author Ian Bremmer insisted that claims of the U.S. dollar dying are overblown. In addition to Bremmer’s comments, economist Paul Krugman also asserted in a recent op-ed that the greenback isn’t going away anytime soon and called some of the speculators “‘Weimarists,’ people who are always predicting hyperinflation.”\n \nPolitical Scientist Ian Bremmer Insists Dollar Death Speculation Is Greatly Exaggerated\n \nThe subject of de-dollarization has been a topical discussion in 2023, as several market observers suspect the United States dollar could collapse in the…",
