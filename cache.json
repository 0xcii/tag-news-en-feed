U.S. inflation figures will be released tomorrow, and are expected to fall to 7.3%. Many believe this will give way to the Federal Reserve pivoting from its aggressive rate hike policy. Ethereum was also lower, and is trading below $1,250 as of writing.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) started the week in the red, as traders prepared for a big week of economic announcements from the United States.\n \nInflation figures will be released on Tuesday, and are expected to fall to 7.3%, down from 7.7% the month prior.\n \nBTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $16,899.39 during Monday’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $17,245.64.\n \n \nAs can be seen from the chart, today’s decline saw bitcoin move lower for a fourth straight day, edging closer to a floor of $16,700 in the process.\n \nThe 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is currently tracking at 47.42, is also nearing a resistance of its own at 46.00.\n \nDepending on tomorrow’s inflation figure we could see BTC move below $16,700, and potentially towards the $16,000 mark.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) also trended downwards on Monday, with prices falling for a second consecutive session.\n \nFollowing a high of $1,281.78 on Sunday, ETH/USD moved to a bottom of $1,243.48 earlier in the day.\n \nThe move saw ethereum fall to its lowest point since November 8, and it is now nearing a floor of $1,230.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, recent bearish sentiment in ETH returned once the RSI failed to break out of a ceiling of 52.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 48.60, and now seems to be moving towards a floor of 45.30.\n \nDespite this downtrend, the 10-day (red) moving average still remains above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect U.S. inflation to fall below 7.3%?
