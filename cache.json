Because we invest at the early stages of a new technology’s development, we invest in equity rather than tokens, only receiving tokens on a pro-rata basis.

Merely having tokens for their sake, or avoiding them without reason, raises immediate red flags. In much of Web3, there's an overflow of tokens made just to have a token.
