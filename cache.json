Analysts and investors are now waiting patiently for the next leg up, as BTC recently stopped at the $69,400 mark and is finding strong support around $66,000. This level is key, as it could determine Bitcoin’s next price movement.\n \n \nKey data from CryptoQuant reveals that the Bitcoin Average Profitability Index is currently at 202%, indicating that the price is roughly twice the realized price. This metric provides confidence to investors and traders who expect Bitcoin to continue rising. \n \nWith profitability still well below levels that typically trigger mass profit-taking, it suggests more room for BTC to grow before significant selling pressure emerges. \n …",
