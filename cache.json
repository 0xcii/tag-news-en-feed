With a 60% surge in new client onboarding, a 20% increase in Asset Under Custody (AUC), a 200% upswing in fiat custody, and a 40-fold growth in staked assets. Notably, BitGo has distinguished itself as the entrusted custodian for the FTX creditors' funds under the leadership of John Ray III. Previously, the company was also selected as the distributor for the Mt. Gox creditors.\nBitGo's recent funding success comes on the heels of the launch of its Go Network, empowering institutions to trade and settle both digital assets and fiat currencies round the clock from secure custody. With a robust presence as a premier regulated custodian in more than 50 countries, BitGo consistently handles an 20% of all on-chain Bitcoin transactions by value, according to the announcement.\nBig name clients, such as Nike, have also chosen BitGo's secure and scalable wallet-as-a-service solution to navigate the intricate regulatory landscape.",

          "description": "The digital asset trust firm Bitgo, headquartered in Palo Alto, California, has secured $100 million in a Series C funding round. While the company remains tight-lipped about the participants in this financial endeavor, this fresh infusion of capital catapults the firm’s post-valuation to $1.75 billion.\n \nBitgo Raises $100 Million From Undisclosed Investors\n \nBitgo has successfully bagged $100 million in a Series C funding round, with the investors’ names under wraps, as per a Bloomberg report. Bitgo’s top executive, Mike Belshe, acknowledged the challenging market landscape. Yet, he emphasized the company’s commitment to licensing and regulatory measures, noting, “Regulatory safety is top-of-mind for everyone,” in a conversation with Bloomberg’s Hannah Miller.\n \nThis update comes on the heels of Galaxy Digital scrapping its intentions to snap up Bitgo for a cool $1.2 billion in August 2022. Earlier, in June, Bitgo had its eyes on the beleaguered crypto custodian, Prime Trust, with acquisition plans. However, the deal fell through. Prime Trust soon found itself filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the following month.\n \n \nThough the Prime Trust deal went south, Belshe indicated to Miller that a portion of this fresh capital would fuel future acquisitions. He alluded to two potential buyouts already in the pipeline, as cited by Miller. While Bitgo remains mum on this round’s backers, past investors have featured big names like Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, Redpoint, Goldman Sachs, and DRW Holdings.\n \nWhat do you think about Bitgo’s latest capital raise for $100 million?

          "description": "An iconic Ordinal is being donated to the team that kickstarted the upstart protocol. \nAnnounced today, Bitcoin Magazine is gifting one of its 23 ‘Historic Covers,’ unique one-of-one Ordinals representing our print magazine’s original run, to the Open Ordinals Institute, a new non-profit dedicated to fostering development of the open-source Ordinals protocol. \nLaunching at the beginning of August, the OOI is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization that plans to accept donations, including those in Ordinals, on behalf of the development team. \nThis means that, a short few months after its debut, ‘Historic Ordinal #3’ is officially off the market. \n \n         \n         \n         \n         \n    \n“We are proud that this prized collectible can give back to the team that has helped kickstart a new era of building on the Bitcoin blockchain,” said Namcios, Bitcoin Magazine Editor and project lead of its Ordinals OTC desk, Rare BTC. \nTo date, Bitcoin Magazine’s Historic Covers have seen over 4.3 BTC in total volume, with our ‘Historic Cover #1’ selling for 1.25 BTC, worth over $30,000 at the time of sale. \nSince its January launch, the Ordinals protocol has caused no shortage of discussion in the Bitcoin community for its much-debated design trade-offs, most notably its ability to enable any arbitrary data to be stored in a bitcoin block and secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. \nAlready, over 20 million ordinals have been minted using the protocol, a feat detractors say is bloating the blockchain. \n“We’re honored to receive one of the Bitcoin Magazine Historic Covers, a tangible piece of Bitcoin history,” said Erin Redwing, President of the Open Ordinals Institute. “As one of the first and most notable collections launched on the Ordinals protocol, these will stand the test of time. And how fitting that it’s a cover of the first Bitcoin ape!”\nBitcoin Magazine ‘Historic Covers’ are now for sale on popular secondary Ordinals markets, including Gamma and MagicEden.",
