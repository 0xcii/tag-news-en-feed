However, the newly gained license will remain non-operational as the company needs to “fully satisfy all remaining conditions and select localization requirements,” which is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.\nThe operational license came months after the Dubai subsidiary of OKX was granted a …",

          "description": "The Ukrainian police, in collaboration with Europol, recently apprehended the alleged mastermind behind a cryptojacking scheme. According to a statement released by Europol, the arrest underscores why the private sector should collaborate with law enforcement.\n \nLaw Enforcement and Private Sector Collaboration\n \nThe Ukrainian police recently arrested a 29-year-old man accused of masterminding a complex cryptojacking scheme. The unnamed man, who was apprehended in Mykolaiv, is believed to have mined cryptocurrencies worth over $2 million using illegally accessed cloud resources.\n \nAccording to a statement released via European Police (Europol), the alleged cryptojacker’s arrest followed months of collaboration between Ukrainian law enforcement, Europol and an unidentified cloud services provider. The statement said the arrest underscores why the private sector should collaborate with law enforcement.\n \nExplaining how the probe, which saw law enforcement agents comb three properties associated with the cryptojacker, unfolded, Europol said:\n \n“A cloud provider approached Europol back in January 2023 with information regarding compromised cloud user accounts of theirs. Europol shared this information with the Ukrainian authorities, who subsequently opened an investigation.”\n \nOn the day of the arrest, the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) of the law enforcement agency set up a command post to support the National Police of Ukraine.\n \n \nMeanwhile, in the statement, Europol shared some anti-cryptojacking tips that cloud service providers can use to stop criminals from illegally accessing cloud computing infrastructure. One way cloud providers can do this is by having strong access controls in place.\n \nCloud service providers can also block cryptojackers by regularly monitoring cloud environments for suspicious activities and keeping cloud resources updated, the statement added.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",

          "description": "David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Ripple, has commented on the alleged “transaction” of 25.6 billion (almost 15 billion US dollars) XRP on January 14. This amount represented almost half of the total circulating supply of XRP, which stands at approximately 54.26 billion. The supposed transaction was reported by the highly-regarded blockchain tracking service Whale Alert to have originated from an unknown wallet, destined for the crypto exchange Bitfinex.\n \nSubsequent investigations, however, quickly debunked the initial concerns. Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Bitfinex, clarified that the event was not a transaction but an attempted exploit of the “Partial Payments” feature in the XRP Ledger. This revelation came as a relief to many in the crypto commu…",
