It is entirely source routed, meaning that the sender of a payment is the one who constructs the entire route from themselves to the receiver in order to facilitate the payment. This presents an issue when it comes to the changing balances of channels over time as they are routing payments between numerous different users across the network, once a sender \"locks in\" and decides on a specific route, that route cannot be changed until a failure message makes it way back to the sender, allowing them to construct an entirely new route going around the point where the initial attempt failed. \nThis necessitates either dealing with a cumbersome and annoying UX, or the use of payment pr…",

Bankman-Fried’s decision to testify comes on the heels of several witnesses who have spoken against him in recent weeks.\n \nFacing Accusations: Sam Bankman-Fried Prepares to Plead His Case Directly to Jury\n \nHaving already shared his side of the story with outlets like The New York Times and Good Morning America, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is gearing up to assert his innocence to a panel comprising 12 jurors and six alternate jurors.\n \nDefense counsel Mark Cohen announced that SBF will take the witness stand, in a press statement conducted via teleconference on Wednesday. This development has been widely reported, with Matthew Russell Lee of Inner City Press providing insights. Russell Lee has confirmed that he will be broadcasting a live stream of SBF’s testimony through social media platform X.\n \nSBF has sat through testimonies from past colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh. He has also heard from FTX’s former general counsel and the CEO of Blockfi, all of whom have testified against him.\n \n \nDespite these challenges, the ex-FTX CEO maintains his innocence, pleading not guilty to all charges, even as he stares down a potential sentence of over 100 years in prison. His testimony is scheduled for Thursday, October 26, 2023, and Cohen has hinted that it will be a comprehensive examination likely to take all day.\n \nSBF won’t be the only one speaking in his defense; Joseph Pimbley of PF2 Securities is also set to testify on his behalf. The latest development follows strategic moves by both the U.S. government and SBF’s defense team as they submitted their juror preferences and requests in anticipation of the trial’s outcome.\n \nWhat do you think about SBF testifying at his trial this week?

The company launched an investigation, and an hour later, withdrawal resumed on the platform.\n \n \n \nBinance Experiences Technical Issues\n \nAccording to a post on social media platform X, withdrawals were paused due to an issue with the middleware service running on the platform. While crypto withdrawals were halted, users had access to fiat withdrawals.\n \nFollowing an investigation that failed to provide details about the specifics of the issue, the crypto exchange restored the service. The company stated:\n \n\nThe issue is now fixed, and all crypto withdrawals on Binance are now back to functioning as usual. Thanks for your patience, and we apologize for the inconvenience.\n \nIn the crypto community, some took to X to promote their platforms over the centralized exchange. In particular, the team behind decentralized exchange (DEX) THORChain took the opportunity to remind users about their alleged advantages over Binance:\n \n\nAll cross-chain services deal with many, many issues and have to pause to deal with edge cases. The difference with TC is that you can jump in and see exactly what’s wrong at any time and don’t need a spokesperson so say “funds are safe” – because you can check it yourself.\n \nBinance has experienced several obstacles lately, from the increasing regulatory oversight in major jurisdictions, such as the US and Europe, and key members leaving their positions. In addition, the exchanges are currently fighting many legal battles while their trading volumes crashed in some regions.\n \n \nStill, the crypto company claims to be committed to continue offering its services to its millions of users. On the latest issue, the exchange’s CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, stated:\n \n\nTechnical issue with a middleware service impacting withdrawals. Funds are SAFU. Our team is on it.\n \nCover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview",

In 2017, retail traders became caught up in the exuberance, and there was a sense that Bitcoin might be a kind of digital gold.
