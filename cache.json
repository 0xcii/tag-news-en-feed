Here are some facts that on-chain data reveals about this event.\n \nSeveral On-Chain Indicators Spiked While Tether Suffered A Depeg\n \nIn the past couple of days, USDT became decoupled from its $1 peg as the stablecoin’s value plunged to $0.996. Since then, however, the asset has seen some recovery, although the $1 peg is yet to be regained as Tether still trends under $0.999.\n \nWhile this isn’t the first time that the largest stablecoin by market cap has observed destabilization, it’s natural that this depegging event has still led to the emergence of fresh FUD in the market.\n \nIn a new post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has looked at how this USDT drop has reflected on the on-chain side of thin…",

Overall, the global cryptocurrency market cap was marginally higher, climbing by 1% as of writing. XRP was an exception, dropping to a three-week low today.\n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nShiba inu (SHIB) moved away from its lowest point in almost two years, as crypto bulls swept in to buy the recent dip in price.\n \nFollowing a bottom of $0.00000653 on Thursday, SHIB/USD rose to a high of $0.00000682 earlier in the day.\n \nThis rally resulted in the meme coin moving away from last Saturday’s bottom at $0.00000600, which is the weakest point price has hit since September 2021.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the sell-off has eased, which came as SHIB began consolidating around a key support point of $0.00000635.\n \nOverall, sentiment in the meme coin remains significantly bearish, with price strength tracking below the 30.00 level.\n \nAt the time of writing, the relative strength index (RSI) is tracking at 25.62, after bouncing from a recent floor at 21.00.\n \n \nXRP\n \nOn the other hand, XRP, formerly ripple, extended a recent downtrend, with the token falling to a fresh multi-week low.\n \nXRP/USD plunged to an intraday low of $0.4601 on Friday, a day after trading at a peak of $0.4833.\n \nAs a result of this decline, XRP fell by nearly 4% in today’s session, dropping to its lowest point since May 26 in the process.\n \n \nIn the last seven days the token has lost nearly 14% of its value, which comes after the price rose to a ten-week high on Tuesday.\n \nInitially, it appears that bulls were likely capturing profits and liquidating their positions, however sentiment shifted, with bears using this as an opportunity to reenter the market.\n \nShould this current trend continue, there is a good chance that XRP will hit a floor of $0.4200 in the near future.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat else could be behind this dip in XRP?

Following the legal action taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance, reports indicate that law enforcement officials in France have initiated an investigation into the matter. The French publication Le Monde has verified this information with the Paris public prosecutor’s office.\n \nThe complaint against Binance contains accusations of “aggravated money laundering” and charges related to the “illegal provision of services for digital assets (PSAN).” It is alleged that Binance neglected to establish a proper know-your-customer (KYC) compliance process within the country. However, a spokesperson from Binance, in correspondence with Reuters, disclosed that the exchange engaged in a meeting with regulators just last week.\n \n \n“In France, on-site visits by regulators and inspectors are part of regulatory obligations to which all financial institutions must adhere. We had an on-site visit last week by the relevant authorities,” the Binance representative said. “We will not comment on the specifics of law enforcement or regulatory investigations except to say that information about our users is held securely and only provided to government officials upon receipt of documented appropriate justification.”\n \nWhat are your thoughts on the French investigation surrounding Binance?
