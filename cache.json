The announcement details:\n \n\nMAS and PBCDCI are embarking on a pilot that will allow travellers from both countries to use e-CNY for tourism spending in Singapore and China. This will enhance convenience for travellers when making purchases during their overseas travel.\n \n \nChina is at the forefront of central bank digital currency (CBDC) development, actively testing its e-CNY project. Since initiating digital yuan research, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has steadily expanded the pilot program’s reach. Presently, there are 26 pilot areas for digital yuan spread across China.\n \nPBOC Governor Yi Gang disclosed in July that transactions utilizing China’s central bank digital currency reached 1.8 trillion yuan ($250 billion) at the end of June. In November, Standard Chartered Bank said that it had begun offering digital yuan exchange services in China. Moreover, the Chinese central bank and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) have entered the second phase of integrating digital yuan for payments and cross-border transactions within Hong Kong.\n \nWhat do you think about the collaboration between China and Singapore to let tourists in both countries spend digital yuan?
