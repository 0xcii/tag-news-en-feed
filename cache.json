          "description": "In the newest episode of Bitcoin Magazine’s \"Bitcoin, Explained,” hosts Aaron van Wirdum and Sjors Provoost discuss the ramifications of a newly discovered exploit dubbed “Milk Sad,” affecting Bitcoin users attempting to run the alternative Bitcoin implementation Libbitcoin when connecting to the network.\nRevealed earlier this month, the issue of an insecure Bitcoin command called \"BX Seed\" in the Libitcoin library has made it vulnerable to attacks, potentially allowing adversaries to guess private keys and access Bitcoin funds.\n\nAs profiled, the insecure command produces only 32-bit random seeds, significantly reducing the number of possible seeds and making it relatively easy to guess a target user’s private keys.\nThe podcast delves into the history of the implementation, as well as other alternatives to the most widely used Bitcoin software, Bitcoin Core. The episode also touches on the responsibility of Bitcoin developers to ensure the security of their code, especially if that code is referenced in widely read resources like books or online tutorials. In this particular case, the BX seed exploit was referenced in Andreas Antonopoulous’ widely read “Mastering Bitcoin.” \nThe hosts suggest that clear warnings should be provided in documentation to indicate that certain commands are unsafe for production use.\nUltimately, the podcast underscores the importance of secure coding practices, thorough testing, and proper communication to prevent vulnerabilities that could potentially lead to financial losses and security breaches in the cryptocurrency space.",

          "description": "In the wake of the meme token’s meteoric ascent, pepe (PEPE) has plummeted by over 17% in the last 24 hours. Buzz on social media suggests a significant amount of funds held by the development team are being transferred to exchanges. Moreover, alterations have been made to the team’s multi-signature wallet.\n \nMeme Token PEPE Tumbles: Wallet Alterations and Big Moves Ignite Suspicions\n \nDoubts loom over the pepe (PEPE) meme token project amid chatter about hefty sums of PEPE shifting to centralized exchanges. On Thursday, onchain experts from Lookonchain pointed out, “[Four] hours ago, [the] Pepe multisig wallet and Wintermute Trading deposited 17.3T PEPE ($18M) to exchanges. [Three] hours ago, an early buyer of PEPE dumped 1.88T PEPE for 1,010 ETH ($1.68M) on a [decentralized exchange].”\n \n \nFast forward to August 25, 2023, Lookonchain delved deeper, revealing that a crypto whale splurged 320 ether on a whopping 640 billion PEPE just three hours prior to the post. Intriguingly, this same whale also amassed billions of PEPE back in June and May. Amidst this frenzied trading activity and intense speculation, it’s been unearthed that modifications have been made to the PEPE team’s multi-sig threshold.\n \n\n \nOne inquisitive observer asked:\n \n\nAny reason why the PEPE multi-sig wallet changed the threshold to just 2/8 signatures? Seems weird, this isn’t standard right? Also, [it] seems that some has been sent to exchanges.\n \nChiming in, onchain expert Zachxbt detailed that PEPE tokens worth $6.5 million found their way to Binance, $8.2 million to Okx, $434K to Bybit, and an additional $389K to an unidentified destination. Since then, PEPE’s value has dwindled by over 17% in a day and 20% over the week. Within the last 24 hours, this meme coin boasted a staggering $294 million in global trade, clinching the 11th spot on Friday in trade volume rankings.\n \nWhat do you think about the suspicions surrounding the PEPE meme coin project?

          "description": "Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have jointly announced a set of proposed regulations focusing on the sale and exchange of digital assets by brokers. The is part of the broader strategy set forth by the Biden-Harris Administration's bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), in attempt \"to close the tax gap, address the tax evasion risks posed by digital assets, and help ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules.\"\n\"These proposed regulations would require brokers, including digital asset trading platforms, digital asset payment processors, and certain digital asset hosted wallets, to file information returns, and furnish payee statements, on dispositions of digital assets effected for customers in certain sale or exchange transactions,\" said the IRS.\nThese regulations obligate brokers of digital assets to report the specific sales and exchanges of their customers. The regulations also introduce the requirement for brokers to furnish a new Form 1099-DA, to help users determine if they owe taxes.\nThe implementation timeline specified in the regulations states that brokers would start reporting information on sales and exchanges of digital assets beginning in 2026, for transactions that occurred during the year 2025. The Joint Committee on Taxation's estimation is that these IIJA provisions could generate nearly $28 billion in revenue over 10 years.\nThe Treasury Department and the IRS are actively soliciting feedback from affected taxpayers, industries, and other stakeholders on the proposed regulations. Written comments will be accepted until October 30, 2023, and the agencies have scheduled a public hearing on November 7, 2023, with a potential follow-up session on November 8, 2023, if the demand necessitates it.",
