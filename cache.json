As of November 30, Argo holds 126 bitcoin, “of which 116 were BTC Equivalents.”\nPreviously, Bitcoin Magazine PRO analysts Dylan LeClair and Sam Rule highlighted Argo as one of several struggling public miners. They noted that a $27 million October fundraise attempt did not go through, which would have been in addition to a preceding $70.6 million loan from NYDIG. Prior to October’s failed raise, in August, Argo used some of its BTC holdings to pay back bitcoin-backed loan obligations from Galaxy Digital.",

A third loan of $16 million, according to the report, “went to an LLC named Red Sea that McCaffrey used, in part, to buy [a] Bahamas apartment.”\nThe Block’s Chief Revenue Officer Bobby Moran will take over as CEO, and the company will seek to restructure in order to buy out McCaffrey’s stake in the company. \nThe report described how the “news came as a shock to The Block's editorial leadership, who sources say are livid about McCaffrey's failure to disclose such a close and critical financial partnership with Bankman-Fried and Alameda…” \nLarry Cermak, The Block’s VP of research, stated that \"Mike never asked me or anyone in research to cover FTX or SBF in any particular way. Or anyone else, for that matter. We had complete discretion to do our jobs.” \nFrank Chaparro, The Block’s news director, released this statement on twitter:",
