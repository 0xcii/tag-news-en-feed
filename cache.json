          "description": "Bitcoiners Need The Guillotine\nAs Scottish economist and philosopher David Hume observed in A Treatise of Human Nature, nothing we know about what is true can tell us what ought to be true and nothing we know about what ought to be true can tell us what is true. The world of objective fact and moral truth are entirely separate. Hume called this the is/ought problem and his argument that descriptive and normative reasoning should be separated is known as Hume’s guillotine. \nHume’s guillotine is a philosophical razor – a rule of thumb for reasoning about the world. It is a way of cutting apart two lines of reasoning that become entangled when they intertwine.
