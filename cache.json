By adding spot bitcoin, it can offer clients an integrated platform that includes both spot and derivatives markets. \nThis enables complex trading strategies like arbitrage and basis trading that leverage price differences between the two.\nCurrently, most spot bitcoin trading occurs on offshore exchanges like Binance. CME, providing a regulated alternative, targets institutional investors who require strict due diligence and compliance standards. \nThe exchange has reportedly held talks with traders expressing strong interest in trading bitcoin in a regulated environment.\nThe move comes as Wall Street ramps up its Bitcoin offerings amid surging demand. Several firms already provide access to SEC-approved Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. CME would differentiate itself by allowing sophisticated trading strategies beyond simple directional bets.\n \n                         \n                         \n                        Click the image to learn more. \n                     \n                    \nInstitutional funds are more inclined to use CME than platforms like Coinbase due to existing relationships.
