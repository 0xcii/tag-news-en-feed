Last month, the company received approval from the city's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to provide virtual asset dealing services.\nThe move comes as Hong Kong approved a Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund earlier this year. With a new licensing regime for exchanges and other policy initiatives, Hong Kong aims to position itself as a Bitcoin and crypto hub. \nBy allowing retail Bitcoin trading on its main app, Futu is leapfrogging rivals. It has also applied for a full Bitcoin and crypto exchange license for its PantherTrade platform, one of 11 \"deemed licensed\" interim exchanges in Hong Kong awaiting SFC approval.\nTo attract new Bitcoin and crypto users, Futu is offering incentives like Alibaba and Nvidia stock as rewards. Customers who deposit HK$10,000 for 60 days get HK$600 of Bitcoin or vouchers and shares. Bigger depositors can earn more rewards.\nFutu is also waiving Bitcoin trading commissions for now to gain market share. It is partnering with licensed exchange HashKey to enable trading under SFC rules.\nBy leveraging its large client base, Futu can uniquely drive significant retail volume for Bitcoin trading in Hong Kong. Its brand name gives its Bitcoin platform instant credibility and trust.",
