Overall, cryptocurrency markets have been mostly bearish in today’s session, and are down 1.07% as of writing. Chainlink was another notable token to fall, and is currently trading by as much as 5% lower.\n \nDogecoin (DOGE)\n \nDogecoin (DOGE) dropped to a ten-day low on Wednesday, with prices falling for a third straight session.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.101 on Tuesday, DOGE/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.09519 earlier in today’s session.\n \nAs a result of this, the meme coin fell to its lowest point since November 28, when prices hit a bottom of $0.0907.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, it appears that DOGE bears are hoping to recapture this level, which is also a key support point.\n \nThis move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) was unable to stay above its own floor, at the 54.00 mark.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 52.07, with its next visible point of support at the 49.25 level.\n \n \nChainlink (LINK)\n \nIn addition to dogecoin, another notable token to fall in today’s session has been chainlink (LINK).\n \nLINK/USD slipped to a bottom of $6.80 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a peak of $7.29.\n \nLike with DOGE, today’s decline has pushed the world’s 20th-largest token to its lowest point since November 28.\n \n \nOn that occasion, prices hit a low of $6.53, which was marginally above a floor at the $6.50 point.\n \nAs of writing, it appears that traders are looking to take LINK back towards this level. This comes as the RSI nears a floor of its own.\n \nThe index is tracking at 46.89, which is close to the point of support at 45.00.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWill chainlink fall below $6.50 this week?
