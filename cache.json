It is currently tracking at 61.17.\n \nShould this momentum continue into the Easter weekend, the next visible ceiling will be at the 65.00 mark.\n \nIf this point is reached, there is a good chance that XRP will be trading above $0.5200.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect xrp to move above $0.5200 this weekend?
