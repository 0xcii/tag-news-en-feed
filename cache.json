Between Jan. 23, 2023, and the date of their appointment, liquidators claimed to have recovered approximately $770,000 which belonged to MTI. \n \nLiquidators’ Fees\n \n\n \nLiquidators of the collapsed bitcoin Ponzi scheme Mirror Trading International (MTI) have so far spent approximately $4.9 million (90.2 million rands) on lawyers and consultants since assuming control, a report has said. According to a Mybroadband report, a total of approximately $6.1 million has so far been disbursed while a further $7.3 million is earmarked for liquidators’ fees.\n \n\n \nIn April 2021, a Bitcoin.com News report said more than $70 million was raised from selling 1,281 bitcoins belonging to MTI. A few months later, another report said more than 8,000 BTC belonging to MTI had been “traced” and that investigators were on track to finding more.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nHowever, according to the report, between Jan.23 and the day they took control of MTI assets, liquidators have so far recovered around $770,000. While liquidators are said to be expecting an “exponential increase in the amount recovered from the so-called net winners,” they are less certain about the growth rate of their expenditure.\n \n\n \nAccording to the blockchain intelligence firm, Chainalysis, MTI was the biggest crypto scam in 2020 which netted more than $500 million for the scheme’s masterminds.\n \n\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
