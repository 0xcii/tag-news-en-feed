It has spent half a century plotting to defeat us,” she stressed, cautioning that China is “building a massive cutting edge military, capable of threatening America and dominating Asia and beyond.”\n \nNikki Haley Warns of China’s Preparation for War\n \nU.S. presidential hopeful and former governor of the state of South Carolina, Nikki Haley, warned in a speech at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics on her economic policy Friday that China is preparing for war.\n \n“Strength and pride are essential to our national survival, especially in the face of Communist China,” she began, elaborating:\n \n\nChina is an existential threat. It has spent half a century plotting to defeat us.\n \n“It’s taken our manufacturing jobs. It’s taken our trade secrets. Now, it’s taking control of critical industries — from medicines to advanced technology. In record time, China has gone from an economically backward country to the second biggest economy on earth,” the Republican presidential candidate continued.\n \n“It has every intention of being the first. And the Communist Party’s motives are clear. They’re building a massive, cutting-edge military, capable of threatening America and dominating Asia and beyond,” she cautioned.\n \nHaley additionally said: “In some respects, China’s military is already equal to the U.S. Armed Forces. In other areas, they’re beating us. China’s leaders are so confident, they’re sending spy balloons into our skies and building a spy base just off our shores in Cuba.” She warned:\n \n\nMake no mistake: The Communist Party is preparing for war. And China’s leaders intend to win.\n \nThe former South Carolina governor also stated: “Joe Biden’s debt and deficits are weakening the dollar and empowering communist China.”\n \nDo you agree with presidential candidate Nikki Haley that China is preparing for war?
