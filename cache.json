          "description": "Here’s how much a “51% attack” would cost for Bitcoin based on the total hashrate connected to the blockchain right now.\n \nCost Of A 51% Attack On The Bitcoin Network Today\n \nIn a new post on X, analyst James V. Straten has provided an estimation for the cost of a 51% attack on the BTC blockchain. A “51% attack” in the context of Bitcoin is when a single group takes control of more than 50% of the hashrate on the network and thus, effectively gains hold of the blockchain as a whole.\n \nThe “hashrate” here refers to a measure of the total amount of computing power that the miners have connected to the BTC network right now. The metric is measured in terms of “Exahashes per second” (EH/s).\n \n \nHere is a chart that shows how the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate has changed over the past y…",

Bankman-Fried will be sentenced on March 28 next year, although he faces a second trial on March 11 for five other charges.\n Trial over, there is now a sense, considering the outcome and how it reflects on the entire crypto industry, that a door has been closed on a turbulent and sometimes strange period.
