          "description": "Data shows that Bitcoin investors have been showing signs of fearful sentiment as the price of the cryptocurrency has plunged below $27,000.\n \nBitcoin Social Dominance Spike Suggests Fear In Market\n \nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, BTC’s social dominance has seen an uplift recently. The “Bitcoin social dominance” is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total discussions involving the top 100 assets by market cap that mention BTC.\n \nWhat this metric tells us is how the current interest in BTC among investors compares with that of the altcoins.

The market is still fearful after a year long downtrend and 78% drop. \n \nHowever, as the old adage states, “when in doubt, zoom out.” In this latest look at BTCUSD, one curved median is all the reassurance needed to know that the top cryptocurrency is still on the right track long term. \n \nZooming Out To Look At Long-Term Logarithmic Growth\n \nAssets of any kind are measured in growth of price and time. Growth can be exponential or logarithmic. \n \nExponential growth is fast and substantial, commonly associated with compound interest in finance. Growth begins slow, then sharply increases.
