With Sui (SUI) recently experiencing a 20% price surge and establishing itself as a formidable contender in the altcoin space, the entrance of Mpeppe (MPEPE), a mobile gaming-focused cryptocurrency priced at just $0.0021, is shaking things up. The question on everyone’s mind is: How will these two tokens compare, and can Mpeppe (MPEPE) rise to challenge SUI’s dominance?\n \nSUI’s Meteoric 20% Pump \nSUI had an impressive week, with a 20% price pump, now trading at around $0.90.
