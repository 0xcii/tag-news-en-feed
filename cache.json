          "description": "Enforcement of last year’s amendment  \nto Estonia’s anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financial of  \nterrorism (CFT) regulation has  \nresulted in a dramatic drop in the number of licensed cryptocurrency service  \nproviders. As of May 1, 2023, there were only 100 crypto firms with operating  \nlicenses, which  \nis an 80% drop from 489 as of March 15, 2022, when the amended Money  \nLaundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act came into force.\nAccording to the Estonia  \nFinancial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a total of 389 operating licenses have been withdrawn  \neither voluntarily or based on its action. Of this number, nearly 200 were  \nwithdrawn by the companies while about the same number were revoked by the  \nfinancial transactions watchdog. \nEstonia, a country in Northern  \nEurope, is considered one of the most crypto-friendly countries in the  \ncontinent alongside Switzerland, Denmark,  \nGermany and Slovenia. As of summer of 2021, when Matis  \nMäeker, FIU’s new head, came into  \noffice, about 650 crypto services licenses were valid in the Baltic nation, the  \nregulator said in a  \nstatement released on Monday.\nWatchdog Finds 'A Lot of Suspicious  \nCircumstances'\nHowever, following tougher  \nchecks in line with the amended regulation, FIU said it found “a lot of suspicious  \ncircumstances” in crypto firm’s license applications. \n“This calls into question the  \ncredibility of the businesses that wanted to come here and their actual desire  \nto provide services in Estonia,” said Mäeker. “It also shows the desire of some  \nindividuals to use the Estonian economic system and financial system for  \nillegal activities.”\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Solomon Oladipupo at www.financemagnates.com.",

          "description": "Bitcoin transaction fees have surged significantly in the past 24 hours, with the average fee reaching $19.20 per transfer. The increase in fees can be linked to a backlog of transactions trapped in the mempool, as over 440,000 unconfirmed transactions are currently awaiting confirmation.\n \nBlock Reward Dethroned: Bitcoin Transaction Fees Surpass Mining Subsidy for the First Time Since 2017\n \nOn Sunday, May 7, 2023, bitcoin transaction fees exceeded the block reward for the first time since December 2017 at block height 788,695. Subsequent block heights 788,700 and 788,702 also witnessed fees surpassing the subsidy.\n \nAt present, over 440,000 bitcoin transactions are pending confirmation with 193 blocks left to mine for clearing them all. Fees soared past the $25 mark per transaction on Sunday, and current data displays an average fee of 0.00069 BTC or $19.20 per transaction.\n \nAccording to bitinfocharts.com data, the median-sized fee is 0.0004 BTC or $11.05 per transfer. High-priority transactions are paying upwards of $22.90 per transaction and individuals are paying $19.95 for medium-priority transactions.\n \nBlock intervals or mining times have been exceeding the ten-minute average lately. The most recent block time was approximately ten minutes and 34 seconds. Slower block times may result in another decline in difficulty — an estimated drop of around 5.3% is anticipated to occur on May 18, 2023.\n \n \nThe average hashrate over the past 2,016 blocks is roughly 338 exahash per second (EH/s). The network’s hashrate has dipped below the 300 EH/s range on some instances and is presently running at 385 EH/s at the time of writing.\n \nWhat impact do you think the surge in bitcoin transaction fees and the backlog of unconfirmed transactions will have on the future of cryptocurrency adoption and scalability?
