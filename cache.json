This makes IBTC the first Australian spot Bitcoin ETF to adopt such transparency measures.\nLaunched earlier this year, the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF has seen steady inflows totalling 134 Bitcoin worth over AUD 11 million. The fund is now collaborating with Hoseki to provide daily proof-of-reserves for its Bitcoin holdings.\nHoseki's advanced verification process, Hoseki Verified, will enable Monochrome to deliver independently verified evidence that investor assets are fully accounted for. This ongoing auditing sets a higher standard for transparency in Australian Bitcoin ETFs.\n\"Proof of reserves is important for establishing full operational transparency of a Bitcoin ETF,\" said Jeff Yew, CEO at Monochrome Asset Management. \"Our partnership with Hoseki highlights our commitment to setting the highest standards for integrity and reliability in Bitcoin ETFs, setting a precedent for the industry.\"\nAccording to Monochrome, the Hoseki integration also aligns with its unique capability for direct Bitcoin applications and redemptions, ensuring privacy while maintaining transparency.\nAs a leading Bitcoin verification provider, Hoseki will conduct real-time validation that IBTC's Bitcoin reserves match its stated holdings. This provides clear proof of assets to investors. The initiative may prompt broader adoption of rigorous verification measures across the Bitcoin ETF landscape.",

          "description": "Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Japan's largest electricity provider, has begun mining Bitcoin through its subsidiary Agile Energy X using excess renewable energy that would otherwise be wasted, as per reports from Asahi.\n\nJUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japan's largest power company TEPCO is mining #Bitcoin using surplus energy. pic.twitter.com/ZrsmbV7mv6\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 9, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nWith over 27 million residential and business customers, TEPCO established Agile Energy in 2022, and now they are exploring Bitcoin mining powered by surplus renewable energy. The subsidiary has installed mining rigs next to solar farms in Japan's Gunma and Tochigi prefectures.\nThe initiative helps reduce wasted green energy from solar and wind farms that are forced to curtail production to avoid overloading Japan's grid. This energy is now being diverted to generate Bitcoin.\n\"Green energy producers have to operate their businesses on the assumption that part of the power they generate is wasted,\" said Agile Energy President Kenji Tateiwa. \"If bitcoins were to provide a new source of income for similar power producers, who are being exposed to overinvestments, that would prompt more green energy to be introduced.\"\nThe project shows how Bitcoin mining can incentivize renewable energy growth by providing producers with additional revenue streams. Tateiwa said Bitcoin profits could encourage further investment in clean energy to power the mining.\nOther countries are also tapping excess renewables for Bitcoin mining, like El Salvador, which uses its geothermal energy. This dispels the myth that Bitcoin is environmentally hazardous, as much mining uses energy that would otherwise be wasted. \nMore and more companies and countries are figuring out how to turn waste and surplus energy into the hardest money on earth. As more renewables come online, Bitcoin mining will help reduce wasted power and emissions.",
