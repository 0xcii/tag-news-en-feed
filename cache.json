While the blockchain did not come to a standstill, there were delays in transactions. But what happened and what was the cause?\n \nOne of the first to report the anomaly was Tom Stokes, co-founder and COO of Node Shark and operator of an ADA stake pool. He wrote: “A few hours ago over half of all Cardano nodes went offline. This is why decentralization matters,” and shared the chart below.\n \n \nAs the above chart shows, the network recovered to around 87% within a short period of time. However, the cause of the incident remained unknown for a rather long time. At press time, the inventor of C…",
