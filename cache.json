          "description": "How The Lead Organizer of Jan 6. Became Meme Coin KINGPIN\n\nDustin Stockton is known as the “Godfather of Political Finance” but he wasn’t always known this way. He was originally heavily involved in campaigning for Donald Trump and was the lead organizer of January 6. As the protest came closer, he realized things would go south and backed out. From home, he watched Trump supporters raid the capitol building. He knew his life was never going to be the same.\n\nA month prior, he was no longer allowed to access his bank account in a process called debanking. This was the result of a fundraising campaign which led to Stockton building a wall on the Mexican border. But, according to the feds, the organization had misappropriated funds. With no bank account, he dived head first into crypto and worked his way to becoming the “godfather of political finance.” \n\nFrom being an advisor to Donald Tremp to an early investor in Joe Boden, he’s invested on every side of the political spectrum.",
