Ethereum holders need to lock in their holdings for a set period to support the blockchain operations in exchange for the reward.\nHowever, the SEC sees staking as an illegal offering by cryptocurrency platforms, as the service can be seen as the offering of unregistered securities. The regulator even took action against many cryptocurrency platforms for offering staking to their US customers.\nIn its amende…",

The bill, seen as a major win for the crypto industry, aims to establish a long-awaited regulatory framework for digital assets in the US.\n \n \nFIT21: Bipartisan Support, But Hurdles Remain\n \nFIT21 received a boost from an unlikely source – former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In a move defying expectations, Pelosi championed the bill, calling it a “first step” towards regulating the burgeoning crypto space. This bipartisan support, with 71 Democrats joining forces with 208 Republicans, marks a historic moment for the industry.\n \nHowever, champagne corks are likely to stay popped for now.
