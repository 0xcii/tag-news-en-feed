However, whispers of caution linger as market volatility continues to cast a shadow over the digital asset.\n \n \nFoot Shot Pattern: A Sign Of Weakness Or Hidden Strength?\n \nBrandt’s analysis hinges on a technical indicator known as the “foot shot pattern,” which historically has preceded price increases.

The majority of these selloffs have emerged from miners and a few other whales, although recent news has emerged that the German government is also selling off its holdings. \n \nDue to the enormous scale of the transactions, selloffs by the government can be classified as whale movements.

According to him, reactions to selloffs from wallets linked to governments are mostly overrated.
