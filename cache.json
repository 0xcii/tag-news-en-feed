The cryptocurrency surged in the last days of September from $53,500 to a high of $66,000, only to pull back to $61,000 in the first few days of October, showing its unpredictable nature. \n \nInterestingly, Bitcoin’s rally to reaching $66,000 has led to a change in the investing dynamics among holder cohorts.
