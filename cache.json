Sebastien Guillemot, CTO and co-founder of Milkomeda, Paima Studios, dcSpark and Flint Wallet claimed in a tweet that Cardano will be a top Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain as early as next month.\n \nThis is made possible by the launch of Milkomeda C1 on mainnet, which was announced last Tuesday. The project has been in constant work since mid-2021 and introduces Cardano’s EVM layer, allowing any ADA user to use EVM contracts directly from any Cardano wallet.\n \n“All in pure ADA.
