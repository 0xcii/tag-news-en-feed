He wrote: \n\"In nature, positive feedback loops like exist with Bitcoin are lethal; the only thing that’s even kept Bitcoin alive this long is its novelty. Either it will remain a novelty forever or it will transition from novelty status to dead faster than you can blink.\"\nSince then, Bitcoin, the world's most famous cryptocurrency, has defied critics and naysayers like Lynch, surging an astonishing 15 million percent in value since. Indeed, Bitcoin has consistently defied the odds, transforming from a niche experiment into a global financial phenomenon.\nStill, the post, unearthed today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo is notable for proving just how wrong Bitcoin critics can be, with Lynch specifically arguing that economies need intervention and that Bitcoin would fail because it lacked it.\n\"The reason this can’t happen with government currencies is that government currencies *are* backed,\" he wrote. \"They’re backed by bullets. If demand for USD starts to fall faster than the USG would like, the USG can just raise taxes without increasing spending, increasing demand and reducing supply simultaneously. There’s a bunch of stuff the FED can do, of course, and the FED tends to act first, but its operations are harder to explain. This is obviously not a perfect mechanism, since bubbles are still blown and popped, but even this mechanism is not available with Bitcoin.\"\nToday, more and more people are seeing just how destructive that intervention can be, with central banks struggling to contain inflation around the globe.",

This movement from the authorities towards understanding and incorporating crypto is most apparent in the EU, through MiCA: a work in progress, but still, the world’s first comprehensive framework for meaningful crypto regulation.\n And, in the US, legal wrangles between the SEC and various crypto entities (including Ripple Labs and Coinbase) may have been anta…",
