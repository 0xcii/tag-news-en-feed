          "description": "The Bitcoin market has been riddled with several whale selloffs since June. The majority of these selloffs have emerged from miners and a few other whales, although recent news has emerged that the German government is also selling off its holdings. \n \nDue to the enormous scale of the transactions, selloffs by the government can be classified as whale movements.
