In 2013, the BKA seized almost 50,000 Bitcoin, from a film piracy website.\nOn Tuesday, the BKA wallet moved $24 million in Bitcoin across two transactions to Kraken and Coinbase. An additional $30 million in Bitcoin was sent to an unknown wallet not affiliated with an exchange.\nArkham data shows that these transfers follow previous movements of $195 million in Bitcoin to exchanges on June 19 and 20. Over $425 million has been shifted in the past week.\nWhile the German government still holds the majority of the seized Bitcoin, the transfers to exchanges may signal an intent to liquidate some of the assets.\nSelling government-held Bitcoin introduces potential downward price pressure. However, the amounts moved so far represent a relatively small portion of daily Bitcoin trading volume. \nNonetheless, Bitcoin dipped below $60,000 on Tuesday amid this news. The German government's Bitcoin wallet still holds over 46,000 Bitcoin worth nearly $3 billion. \nFor German police, the Bitcoin seized from illegal activities has dramatically increased in value. Selling even a fraction provides an unexpected windfall. However, concerns about potential impacts on the broader Bitcoin market remain.",
