Meanwhile, the AI seemed less optimistic about the meme coin hitting this price level in the short term, as it says that it is highly improbable considering the massive price jump required.\n \n \nBard also predicts that SHIB’s price will rise significantly within the next few years, although it might not reach the $1 price level by then.
