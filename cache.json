          "description": "In a move that underscores the momentum of Bitcoin Ordinals protocol ecosystem, the OnChainMonkey (OCM) project has committed to migrating its entire digital art collection from Ethereum to Bitcoin. \nIn total, moving the collection, which includes burning the old NFTs on Ethereum so they can no longer be traded, cost the project over $1 million in Bitcoin fees.\nOnChainMonkey, created by Metagood, became the first profile picture collection created entirely on-chain in a single Ethereum transaction back in 2021. Further, it launched its first Ordinals collection in February shortly after the Ordinals launch.\nNotably, the decision was supported by a broad portion of OnChainMonkey NFT owners, with users voting to subsidize a portion of the substantial migration cost.\nThe DAO proposal gained overwhelming support, with a quorum of 2,000 votes reached within 24 hours. Overall, 99% of voters backed the migration to Bitcoin, a sign that signals NFT users believe Ordinals on Bitcoin may have a greater value than Ethereum-backed NFTs.\n\"Our OCM community has conviction in our move to Bitcoin. We have been involved with Ordinals since the beginning of the year, and the OCM community, in particular, has a great understanding of the potential and benefits of the migration to Bitcoin,\" Metagood CEO Danny Yang said.\nThe transaction comes at a time when the Ordinals market has cooled considerably, with total transaction volumes and sales across exchanges seeing a notable decline.\nThat said, the news suggests this sector of the market could be gearing up for a second push given that Bitcoin Ordinals represent such a significant technology improvement over crypto-based NFTs.",

The law was met with both excitement and skepticism, though any rumors the move would cause the country to default have proved exaggerated. \nA…",

          "description": "Israeli law enforcement recently raided the offices of a company accused of producing software used by criminals to defraud crypto investors of millions of dollars. Some six suspects were arrested following the raid on a company that is reportedly operated by the country’s infamous crime families.\n \n‘Sting Software’\n \nThe Israeli police’s National Cyber Crime Unit recently raided an IT company whose so-called “sting software” has helped criminal syndicates to steal millions of dollars from crypto investors. According to a Ynet News report, six individuals were arrested while dozens were taken in for questioning.\n \nAccording to the report, the raided company is believed to be operated by the country’s infamous crime families. In his remarks following the raid, Dudi Katz, the head of Lahav 433’s National Cyber Crime Unit, said:\n \n“We were able to stem the tide of this crime wave and bring down hundreds of call centers. This operation spanned internationally and was unique in scope, including cooperation with German police forces.”\n \nIn addition to German law enforcement, members of the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority as well as the Israeli Tax Authority were also involved in the raid.\n \n\n \nDetained Suspect Denies Charges\n \nAs stated in the report, criminal syndicates would lure unsuspecting victims with the promise of high returns on crypto investment. The victims who showed an interest were then given purported credentials to access or control their investment portfolio. However, the report said when victims attempted to withdraw or cash out their profits they would realize that this option was not available.\n \nMeanwhile, one unnamed suspect’s legal representatives Shay Roda and Uri Goldman said their client rejects the charges. They said as the investigations into the company continued, they would be able to relay the suspect’s “message to the relevant cyber investigators.”\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",
