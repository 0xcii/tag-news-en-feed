One is bitcoin, the asset which has a fixed supply and is quite volatile, and the second kind of Bitcoin, the network and protocol that maintains an immutable ledger that has never been hacked and is bullet proof, bomb proof and tank proof. It is my opinion that too much focus is placed on the asset and not nearly enough on the network, protocol and immutable ledger. \nWhile listening to a recent podcast Peter McCormack had with Dhruv Bansal they discussed the network and protocol in a new way. \nI really liked Dhruv’s framing of how to view the fixed supply of bitcoin.

He cited increasing mainstream and institutional adoption as key drivers of Bitcoin's growth.\nThe prominent financier and former White House Communications Director highlighted the major impact of SEC-approved Bitcoin spot ETFs in unlocking billions in new investments this year. He compared the over $10 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows in Q1 favourably to the slower adoption of early gold ETFs.\nScaramucci also discussed the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will reduce daily supply and potentially dramatically impact prices. He believes the market has not priced in the halving, predicting a supply squeeze.\nAlthough volatile, Scaramucci stressed Bitcoin's inflation-hedging ability over a 4-year investment horizon, touting its digital gold narrative. He sees potential for Bitcoin's market cap to reach 50% of gold's valuation.\nScaramucci has been an avid Bitcoin proponent, with Skybridge taking an early institutional interest in Bitcoin. The firm led a high-profile push to offer Bitcoin exposure in 401(k) retirement plans, underscoring its commitment.\nDespite some mainstream scepticism over the years, Scaramucci has maintained a bullish long-term outlook on Bitcoin as an emerging digital store of value. He cites generational wealth transfers and Bitcoin-friendly demographics as setting the stage for massive growth.\nScaramucci also touched on the FTX collapse, its impact, regulatory issues, and his optimism regarding the Bitcoin industry's future maturation.",
