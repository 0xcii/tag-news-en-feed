And this has not gone unnoticed by the traditional financial (TradFi) market players. As an analysis by Joshua Lim shows, TradFi could have played a major role in the recent Bitcoin rally to over $38,000.\n \nLim, a former high-ranking official at Genesis Global Trading and Galaxy Digital, shared an in-depth analysis via X (formerly Twitter), laying bare the strategies and market movements preceding the much-anticipated spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n \nTradFi Bets Big On Bitcoin\n \nLim’s first point focused on the extraordinary volatility in the CME futures market during the November to December roll window. The annualized rates in this period skyrocketed to over 23%, marking it as …",

          "description": "Traditionally, creating an n-of-n multisig using CHECKMULTISIG means you’ll publish a proportional number of signatures and public keys on the blockchain to signers in the transaction. This approach not only reveals the total number of participants in the transaction, but also incurs progressively higher transaction fees as the number of signers grow. MuSig, on the other hand, allows a group of users to collectively generate a single signature and public key to validate a transaction, which enhances privacy and lowers the transaction costs for all the signers involved. \nWhen MuSig was initially introduced in 2018, its main shortcoming compared to CHECKMULTISIG was user experience, specifically the requirement for three rounds of interactive communication between signers.
