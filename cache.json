          "description": "The flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, recently dropped below $40,000. This continues the crypto token’s decline, which began around the time the Spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved.

Grayscale’s move in the market is believed to be the reason why Bitcoin’s price has continued to plummet. \n \n \nNewsBTC had previously reported how GBTC experienced outflows of over $2 billion in just …",
