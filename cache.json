In a recent declaration by Phoenix Group PLC, a bitcoin mining enterprise, it was revealed that the company successfully garnered $370 million through an initial public offering (IPO) that was highly sought after, achieving a 33-fold oversubscription.\n \nUAE Forges New Path in Bitcoin Mining With Phoenix Group’s $370M IPO\n \nBitcoin mining and blockchain infrastructure firm Phoenix Group has announced it’s raised 1.3 billion UAE dirhams ($370 million) in an IPO that started on November 16 and closed two days later. The company will be listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) with the ticker PHX.\n \n“The overwhelming interest during the offer period is a powerful endorsement of our pioneering role in cryptocurrency mining and blockchain,” Bijan Alizadehfard, the co-founder and group CEO of Phoenix said.\n \nThe company’s prospectus says that it has established significant operations including a mining farm in Oman in collaboration with Green Data City and Microbt. Phoenix is also involved in multiple other ventures, such as hosting agreements with PTC Cloud Tech – FZCO, power supply contracts with Marlboro Electric Cooperative, and a 20% stake in Bitzero Inc.\n \n \nThe prospectus details that the company’s focus initially is on growth and expansion, with plans to adopt an active dividend policy after 2-3 years. This strategy is designed to return to shareholders substantially all of its distributable free cash flow while maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. Phoenix co-founder Munaf Ali added the capital raise from the IPO was a significant milestone.\n \n“The exceptional oversubscription during our offer period is a clear indicator of the market’s endorsement of Phoenix Group as a leader in Cryptocurrency Mining and Blockchain Technology,” Ali stated.\n \nWhat do you think about Phoenix’s IPO raise?

The firm informed its U.S. clientele that they could “withdraw and transfer” their funds to a different wallet.\n \nWallet of Satoshi Halts U.S. Operations\n \nA recent update on X (previously known as Twitter) revealed that Wallet of Satoshi (WoS), headquartered in Australia, is ceasing operations in the United States. WoS, an application available on iOS and Android, enables users to manage bitcoin (BTC) and Lightning Network transactions. Daniel Alexiuc established the company in 2018.\n \nThe announcement from WoS expressed, “We’ve made the difficult decision to remove our app from the U.S. Apple and Google app stores, and will not serve U.S. customers going forward.” The statement emphasized, “This decision doesn’t come lightly. Our commitment to providing a secure, user-friendly, and compliant platform globally is unwavering. Our top priority is the safety and interests of our customers and our company.”\n \nFurther, the WoS statement mentioned:\n \n\nWe understand this may be disappointing news and we share your frustration. We’re hopeful that future developments will allow us to revisit and possibly resume our operations in the U.S.\n \n \nThis move coincides with what was shaping up to be a record-breaking month for WoS, as observed by Kevin Rooke. “Wallet of Satoshi is on pace to process over 1.1 million Lightning payments in November,” stated Rooke two days prior. He attributed the surge in transactions this month largely to effective Lightning advertising.\n \nWhat do you think about the Wallet of Satoshi leaving the U.S. and pulling its apps from the Google Play and Apple App Store?
