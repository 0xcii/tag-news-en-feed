Immediately after the X announcement, crypto detective ZachXBT revealed the sum stolen and the address where the funds had been sent.\n \nIt was later informed that the crypto heist had been an inside job instead of an external one, as one of the project’s developers seemed to be responsible.\n \n…",

We are creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency, and I'm pleasantly surprised and I would have never predicted it before we filed it, that we were going to see this type of retail demand.\"\nFink's bullish stance on Bitcoin's long-term prospects aligns with the broader trend of institutional adoption and recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment opportunity. As the CEO of the world's largest asset management firm, Fink's positive outlook on Bitcoin carries significant weight and may influence investor sentiment towards BTC.\n\"$IBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs,\" Fink continued.\nThe overwhelming success of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF reflects a shift in investor preferences towards Bitcoin, driven by factors such as inflation concerns, economic uncertainty, and diversification in investment portfolios. Bitcoin's unique characteristics, including its limited supply and decentralized nature, have positioned it as a store of value and a hedge against traditional financial risks.\nAs BlackRock's $IBIT continues to experience rapid growth, Fink's endorsement of Bitcoin's long-term viability adds further credibility to BTC's role in the global financial landscape. The increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin related investment products signals a maturing market and a broader acceptance of BTC as part of a diversified investment strategy.",

          "description": "The demand for US spot Bitcoin ETFs surged significantly on Tuesday, outpacing the new supply created daily by miners by a remarkable 614%, according to Gayatri Choudry, Quantitative Research Analyst at Bitwise Asset Management.\n\nDemand from US BTC ETFs exceeds new BTC supply by 7x pic.twitter.com/OCU5D19rpf\n— Gayatri (@GayatriPC_) March 27, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nThe surge in demand for Bitcoin ETFs reflects growing interest among institutional and retail investors in gaining exposure to the digital asset, without having to manage the BTC themselves. ETFs offer a convenient and regulated way for investors to participate in the potential upside of Bitcoin's price movements while mitigating some of the risks associated with direct ownership and custody.\nThe Bitcoin halving, scheduled to occur in less than a month, will reduce the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This event is significant because it reduces the rate at which new bitcoin is generated by half, making BTC more scarce over time. As demand for Bitcoin ETFs continues to rise and outpace new supply, the available bitcoin on the market is becoming drastically scarce.\nThe combination of rising demand for Bitcoin ETFs and the impending Bitcoin halving have been the catalysts for the surge in Bitcoin's price this year, with BTC now up over 55% year-to-date at the time of writing. Since BlackRock initially filed its spot Bitcoin ETF application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, BTC has risen over 173%.\nMarket participants remain eager to see how Bitcoin will react to the upcoming halving, as this is the first market cycle in Bitcoin's history where its price reached a new all time high before the halving. Historically, it would take a few months for the 'supply shock' to jump start a rise in Bitcoin's price following a halving. But now, with demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs growing with no end in sight, Bitcoin has already experienced a big supply shock, and the new supply of BTC per day is about to get cut in half.",
