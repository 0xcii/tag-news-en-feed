          "description": "In a recent legal move, Digital Currency Group’s (DCG) subsidiary Genesis Global Capital LLC has filed a complaint against the crypto exchange platform and custodian Gemini. Genesis hopes to claw back $689 million from the centralized crypto trading platform founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in 2014. \n \nGenesis Targets Gemini in $689M Legal Battle Over Alleged Preferential Crypto Withdrawals\n \nThe court filing, filed on November 21, 2023, accuses Gemini of withdrawing over $689 million in the months leading to Genesis’ Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. This action, according to Genesis, unfairly benefited Gemini at the expense of other creditors.\n \nThe complaint, filed in the wake of significant crypto market instability that began in 2022, targets transactions occurring in the 90 days preceding Genesis’ bankruptcy declaration. According to the document, Gemini’s withdrawals totaled approximately $689.30 million, a move Genesis describes as preferential and detrimental to the broader creditor base.\n \nThis situation arose during a period marked by notable fluctuations and uncertainty within the cryptocurrency sector, further complicating the financial dynamics at play. Genesis’ legal strategy aims to invoke the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code to rectify what it perceives as an inequitable situation.\n \n \nBy doing so, they intend to recover the withdrawn funds in a clawback, thereby restoring a level playing field among all of Genesis’ creditors. The lawyers insist the focus is not just on the monetary aspect but also on the principles of fairness and equitable treatment in bankruptcy proceedings.\n \nThe complaint details the significant withdrawals by Gemini, characterizing them as preferential transfers. These actions, as per the filing, allowed Gemini to allegedly gain an advantage over other creditors, an advantage that Genesis seeks to nullify.\n \nWhat do you think about the Genesis court filing against Gemini?

It is a frequently cited reason by those skeptical of Bitcoin to justify their reluctance to explore further education. Thankfully many excellent writers have written extensively debunking this piece of FUD. Bitcoiners often emphasize the logistical challenges, intense resource costs, game-theoretical complexities, and the sheer implausibility of any attempt by the State to outlaw Bitcoin.

Subsequent to the heist, the stolen funds were redirected to various decentralized exchange (dex) platforms.\n \nMajor $86 Million Theft Hits Heco Bridge\n \nIn a recent setback for a venture linked to Tron’s creator, Justin Sun, it’s estimated that $85 to $86 million has been drained from the Heco Bridge. Blockchain security firms Cyvers and Peckshield raised the alarm about this breach, stating, “Our initial analysis indicates the suspicious $86.6m outflow from Heco Chain bridge was from a compromised operator, which was operational since [October 8, 2022].”\n \nIn a strategic move in 2022, Sun combined HTX’s Heco Chain with the Tron and Bittorrent blockchains, aiming to foster a more integrated platform and promote cooperation between developers from Heco, Tron, and Bittorrent. Recently, Sun’s ventures have been recurrent targets of significant cyber attacks, including the HTX (formerly Huobi) hack, the Poloniex breach, and the latest Heco Chain incident.\n \n \nCurrently, the perpetrator’s wallet holds 30,949 ether, valued at $62.83 million, which is only a portion of the total stolen amount. As of 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on November 22, 2023, there has been no update from Heco Chain’s X account regarding the situation. However, Sun has addressed the issue on social media, revealing that HTX is preparing to compensate for the lost funds.\n \n“HTX will fully compensate for HTX’s hot wallet Losses,” Sun wrote. “Deposits and withdrawals [are] temporarily suspended. All funds in HTX are secure, and the community can rest assured. We are investigating the specific reasons for the hacker attack. Once we complete the investigation and identify the cause, we will resume services.”\n \nWhy do you think Justin Sun-linked projects are being attacked?
