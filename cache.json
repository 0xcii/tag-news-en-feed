PayPal is headquartered in Luxembourg, which could prove to be an entryway for the other 26 countries in the bloc.\n \nThis could happen if the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is passed and goes into effect. If this happens, PayPal will permit customers in Luxembourg to buy, sell, and hold digital currencies.\n \nThe proposed MiCA regulation will allow firms registered in any member state to get a license to offer services all across the EU. This process has been termed “passporting.”\n \nJose Fernandez da Ponte, SVP and GM, of blockchain, and digital currencies at PayPal, at the time, said;\n \n\nAdding Luxembou…",

          "description": "Last month, the provincial energy regulator was asked to reallocate 270 megawatts that was set aside for cryptocurrency mining.\nThe Québec government’s utility company, Hydro-Québec, has requested the reallocation of 270 megawatts of energy set aside for cryptocurrency mining, once again signaling another Canadian government entity’s desire to curtail or modify bitcoin mining in the country. As of December of 2021, Canada had 6.48% of global hash rate according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.\nA Bitcoin Magazine article from 2021 details the various regulatory challenges in Canada, as well as the successful operations that continue to prosper in the country despite these. Recently, the Manitoba province’s government set an 18-month moratorium on new mining operations. In the past, Canada has experienced large influxes of miners seeking to take advantage of the abundance of power there. \nAccording to a report by the Wall Street Journal, “Hydro-Québec charges the lowest rates for industrial power in North America, with average prices as of April 1 of 3.93 cents per kilowatt-hour… The average cost in North America is 8.22 cents, according to Hydro-Québec.”\n\nThe request is up for approval by Québec’s energy regulator, Régie de l’énergie du Québec, which is believed to be completed within the next few months. The move would not restrict power to existing firms within the province, but could impact future development and investment into the region. \nBitcoin miners’ ability to move their equipment does make it possible for operations to shift out of the region to more friendly locations such as Texas or Wyoming, which could become prime examples of the power of favorable regulation. This has been demonstrated before, most dramatically with the hash rate migration out of China after their bitcoin mining ban.",
