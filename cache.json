Price briefly fell below the $30,000 level earlier in the session, however bullish momentum has since returned. Ethereum rose above $1,900 for a short period.\n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin (BTC) rebounded from recent losses on Tuesday, ahead of the upcoming U.S. consumer confidence report.\n \nThe Conference Board expects its index to rise to a reading of 104.0 in June, up from 102.3 the month prior.\n \nBTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $30,751.19 on Tuesday, following a low at $29,955.74 to start the week.\n \n \nThe move appears to have occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a support point at 68.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index now sits at a reading of 70.17, which is once again in overbought territory.\n \nA barrier at 73.00 is now the next visible ceiling, and unless bulls break out of this point, BTC will likely move back below $30,000.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) briefly rose above the $1,900 level in today’s session, after falling towards a support level of $1,830 on Monday.\n \nFollowing a low of $1,840.22 to start the week, ETH/USD jumped to a peak at $1,905.36 earlier in the day.\n \nMomentum has since shifted, with the world’s second largest cryptocurrency once again falling below the $1,900 level.\n \n \nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,881.79, with the RSI marginally below a resistance level of 58.00.\n \nOverall, momentum is bullish, following a recent crossover between the 10-day (red) moving average, and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nShould this cross mature, there is a good chance that ETH will not only move above $1,900, but closer to $2,000.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nDo you expect ethereum to reach $2,000 in July?
