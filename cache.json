The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has mostly consolidated in recent days, as traders await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole this Friday. \n \nBitcoin\n \nBitcoin moved below a key price floor late on Tuesday, as the cryptocurrency extended its streak of consolidation.\n \nFollowing an earlier high of $26,160.78, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,520.73 late during yesterday’s session.\n \nThis resulted in price diving to a five-day low, and below a recent support point at the $25,600 level.\n \n \nBitcoin chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \n\n \nAs of writing, bitcoin has since rebounded and is currently trading at $25,870.08, with the relative strength index (RSI) hovering around a floor of its own at 20.00.\n \nPrice strength now sits at 19.82, which remains in the depths of a bear zone, however, it also acts as a positive for longer-term bulls, as sentiment appears to have already found a bottom.\n \nFriday’s Jackson Hole Symposium could provide a spark that markets have been missing in recent days.\n \n \nEthereum\n \nEthereum (ETH) briefly fell under the $1,600 level yesterday. However, price has gone on to recover in today’s session.\n \nETH/USD bottomed out at $1,596.38 on Tuesday, following a peak of $1,662.88 earlier in the day.\n \nSimilar to bitcoin, this drop pushed ethereum to its lowest point since last Thursday, which is when markets reacted to the Spacex news.\n \n \nEthereum chart by TradingView\n \n\n \n \nETH is now trading at $1,637, and comes as the RSI bounced from a support level of 22.00, and has now moved to 23.19.\n \nThe 27.00 mark remains the target for bulls currently in the market, with a collision likely to result in ETH rising above $1,700.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCan ethereum hit $1,700 this week?

It seems likely that the comment was, at least in a way, meant to be derogatory. Perhaps this is because so few people actually understand what Bitcoin even is. Just the mention of cryptocurrency will make the majority of people roll their eyes at the scandal-ridden, casino-like and often-fraudulent topic.

The problem with lumping bitcoin in with cryptocurrency is that the vast majority of people cannot identify the difference between bitcoin and any other coin. …",
