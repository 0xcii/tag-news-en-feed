A Spanish judge released the man who has since denied the allegations.\n \nCao de Benos Released Without Conditions\n \nThe Spanish police announced on Dec. 1 that it had arrested a man accused by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) of contracting with jailed Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith to help North Korea evade sanctions. Alejandro Cao de Benos, who used a false identity, was caught in Barcelona while preparing to leave for Madrid.\n \nAccording to a Reuters report, the DOJ has previously accused Cao de Benos of asking Griffith to use his expertise to assist North Korea in busting U.S. sanctions. Griffith is now serving a more than 5-year sentence for his supposed role in the conspiracy.\n \n\n \nFollowing his arrest, Cao de Benos, who founded the Korea Friendship Association, appeared before a Spanish judge who has since released him without conditions. After his release, Cao de Benos immediately pleaded his innocence in a post on X (formerly Twitter). He added that there would be no extradition.\n \n“There is no extradition. The US accusation, besides being false, does not exist in Spain,” Cao de Benos said on X.\n \nHowever, according to an unnamed Spanish judicial source, the U.S. now has to formalize the process to have Cao de Benos extradited. If convicted, Cao de Benos faces up to 20 years in prison.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on this story? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.",
