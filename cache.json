          "description": "In the world of crypto trading, there are many ways to identify opportunities, one of the most prominent methods being technical analysis. This is the study and general breaking down of charts using various indicators and charting patterns. One such technique is known as Support and Resistance strategy. \n \nSupport\n \nA support, which is also known as a floor, is the lower horizontal line holding up price at a certain level. You can identify a floor by drawing a line in the area you believe the price hits but rarely moves below. A simple strategy some traders use is buying at the floor because they have seen the markets go up each time price hits that level.\n \n \n \nResistance\n \nOn the other hand, a resistance (upper horizontal line) is the ceiling and reverse of the floor. When the market hits a ceiling, prices fall back down towards the floor. Traders sometimes sell when they see the price has hit a resistance.\n \n \nBreakout\n \nLastly, traders use these lines to identify opportunities for a breakout. A breakout is where both support and resistance is used to anticipate the point where price escapes consolidation. When the markets break out of the resistance traders normally look to buy. When the markets break out of the floor they look to sell. This strategy signals a shift in price momentum in the direction where the breakout takes place.\n \n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat other technical analysis tools would you like us to cover?

The mining company, recognized on the public market, detailed that the consignment is valued at approximately $61.6 million, translating to $14 for each terahash per second (TH/s).\n \nCleanspark Amplifies Mining Capabilities, Snags 4.4 EH/s of Bitmain’s S21 Antminers\n \nCleanspark (Nasdaq: CLSK), a U.S.-based bitcoin mining firm, divulged its procurement of 4.4 EH/s of the fresh S21 miners from mining equipment titan Bitmain. Though the specifics were not openly shared, the dispatch indicates that the Bitmain S21 Antminers boast an efficiency quotient of 17.5 joules per terahash (J/TH), suggesting the purchase likely involved the air-cooled S21 models.\n \nThese air-cooled S21 models yield 200 TH/s each, necessitating 22,000 units for the company to hit the 4.4 EH/s mark. The apparatuses hold a cumulative worth of $61.6 million, as per Cleanspark.\n \nBitmain is fronting the capital for the residual 20%, with the balance postponed until a year post-delivery, indicating an upfront disbursement of $11.2 per TH/s. The announcement underscores that shipments are slated to kick off in January 2024.\n \n \nThis acquisition by Cleanspark comes on the heels of Iris Energy securing 1.4 EH/s of Bitmain’s S21 hardware for $19.6 million. Bitcoin mining conglomerates are bracing for the impending reward halving, a mere 196 days out, and enhancing the joules per terahash ratio is crucial for augmenting revenue streams.\n \n“Integrating the S21 into our mining operations is in line with our commitment to using the most efficient mining technology,” Zach Bradford, CEO of Cleanspark, explained on Wednesday.\n \nWhat do you think about Cleanspark acquiring 4.4 EH/s of Bitmain’s new S21 miners?
