After being somewhat less forthcoming with his love for Dogecoin in recent weeks, Musk responded to a series of tweets from Mcdonald’s and ultimately to a question from a DOGE community member.\n \nHere’s what happened. McDonald tweeted “what did i miss” yesterday, prompting Binance’s Twitter account to reply, “A lot of green candles.”\n \nMcdonald’s then once again showed its love for the crypto community by responding with “wagmi” – an acronym for “we are all gonna make it”, which is often used by the crypto community to build trust and encourage the community not to lose hope. Musk responded with “Oh hi lol.”\n \n \nOh hi lol\n \n— Mr. Tweet (@elonmusk) January 27, 2023\n \n\n \nOn this, a DOGE community member pulled out an old tw…",

Subsequently, Strike has launched a pilot integration with Clover allowing merchants to accept bitcoin over the Lightning Network.\n\n\n\nAccording to his announcement, the integration is not limited to Strike. Instead, merchants will be able to accept Lightning payments from any source — “From Cash App to a node over Tor. If it can make a Lightning payment, you can use it,” Mallers stated on Twitter.\nMallers clarified that this rollout is part of a 90-day trial period, which will involve measuring the speed and cost of facilitating transactions using the new integration. In addition to that, the amount of business that integrating Lightning brings to merchants will be closely monitored. \nAfter the pilot, Strike aims to enter the Clover app store, and afterwards, direct integration into Clover. This would enable Lightning by default for all Clover merchants, putting it right next to card networks like Visa and MasterCard. \n“Ultimately, these payment giants want to see Lightning in action,” Mallers said on Twitter. “They want to feel it, touch it, and see people use it. An open, instant, cheap, inclusive, and innovative payment network seems too good to be true. Time to show Lightning is the world's superior payments rail.”\nThe trial period is now active and Clover merchants can reach out to Strike in order to enable cheaper, faster payments using the Bitcoin Lightning Network.",
