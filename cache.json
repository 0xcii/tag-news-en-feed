The first step to bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading on Nasdaq would be the custody service for the assets.\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, “Nasdaq has applied to the New York Department of Financial Services for a limited-purpose trust company charter, which would oversee the new business.”\nLaunching just as several major cryptocurrency firms have collapsed, amidst increasing regulatory tension, the goal is seemingly to offer those customers who now have no platform, a regulated, well-trusted American service for bitcoin. \nIt should be noted that many of the issues surrounding exchanges come from the third-party risks presented by a custodian holding bitcoin for customers. The most secure way to interact with bitcoin is to self-custody it with your own wallet. Although trading platforms do offer the ease of interaction created by custodianship, with the American financial system seeing precarious headlines as of late, it is important to consider these trade offs compared with traditional bitcoin self-custody.",
