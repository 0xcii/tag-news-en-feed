However, Trump did not provide specifics on his proposed crypto policy.\nDespite San Francisco's liberal reputation, Trump's fundraiser drew support from several high-profile local venture capitalists and crypto investors, who cited excessive regulation as a primary concern. Jacob Helberg, an adviser to Palantir, noted, \"President Trump made clear that the Biden-Gensler crusade against crypto will grind to a halt within one hour of a second Trump administration.\"\nJust last week, Donald Trump historically became the first U.S. President to accept Bitcoin Lightning Network donations, following comments he made recently saying that he wants the future of crypto to be in America, and not driven overseas due to harsh regulations.\nAs the 2024 presidential election approaches, Trump's stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is playing a significant role in garnering support from over 50 million crypto owners and enthusiasts in the United States, while his opposition, Joe Biden, has taken a tough stance on the industry.",
