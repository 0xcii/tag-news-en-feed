Additionally, BTC holders can benefit from the platform, enjoying an attractive BTC-native return.\nAs part of the partnership, Merkle Standard plans to sell exposure to 100 PH/s of hashrate over a 30-day period, receiving 7.5 BTC in immediate upfront liquidity. Luxor Tech, a mining software and services company, is among the LPs that have filled the trade.\nSebastien Hess, CEO at Block Green, expressed excitement about the partnership, stating, \"Our platform empowers Bitcoin miners to unlock and access future liquidity and hedge revenue risks, driving growth capital coupled with risk mitigation for sophisticated mining operations.\"\nHead of Research at Merkle Standard, Holden Guillies, shared the enthusiasm, emphasizing the innovative nature of the collaboration, saying, \"This innovative financial product provides us with a new way to manage risk by hedging mining difficulty while gaining upfront liquidity.
