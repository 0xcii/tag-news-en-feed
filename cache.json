The authorities also seized three hardware wallets containing about $1 million in cryptocurrencies, approximately 50,000 euros in cash, three vehicles, electronic equipment, documents, and data backups.\n \n \nVictims, primarily from Germany, were initially convinced to invest small sums of money. “Fake price hikes leading to supposedly lucrative profits for investors then persuaded them to make transfers of higher amounts,” the EU law enforcement agency noted, adding:\n \n\nCurrently, it is estimated that the financial damage to German victims is over two million euro.\n \nEuropol further revealed that there are also victims in other countries, including Switzerland, Australia, and Canada.\n \nWhat do you think about the authorities cracking down on cryptocurrency scams?

          "description": "Solana started the week trading near a two-month high, as momentum remained marginally bullish, despite market consolidation. The global cryptocurrency market cap is currently trading 0.98% higher as of writing. Shiba inu also traded close to recent highs, despite declines on Monday. \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nSolana (SOL) remained near a two-month high to start the week, despite crypto markets beginning to consolidate recent gains.\n \nSOL/USD hit an intraday high of $24.75 on Monday, which comes less than a day after falling to a bottom of $22.68.\n \nThis move means that the token remains close to this weekend’s high of $25.03, which was the strongest point for SOL since November 8.\n \n \nFrom the chart, it appears as sentiment in solana is still somewhat bullish, which comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to track above a support point at 80.00.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 80.18, with solana trading at the $23.42 price point.\n \nShould the index remain about 80.00 in the coming days, it is likely that SOL could once again move toward $25.00.\n \n \nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n \nLike SOL, shiba inu (SHIB) bypassed today’s price consolidation, maintaining recent highs in the process.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.00001009 on Sunday, SHIB/USD climbed to a peak of $0.00001099 earlier today.\n \nMonday’s action has seen the meme coin continue to trade near the two-month high of $0.00001111, hit last Friday.\n \n \nLike many cryptocurrencies last week, prices of shiba inu were mostly overbought in recent days, with the RSI falling from a ceiling at 80.00.\n \nCurrently, the index is tracking at 73.00, with a floor at the 70.00 mark a possible target for sellers.\n \nHowever, bulls seem to be rejecting this proposition on Monday, with some eyeing a rally back above $0.00001100 instead.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCould we see shiba inu hit a fresh two-month high this week?

          "description": "Recent examples of so-called “experts” speaking confidently, yet incorrectly, about Bitcoin will come back to haunt them.\nThis is an opinion editorial by Mickey Koss, a West Point graduate with a degree in economics. He spent four years in the infantry before transitioning to the Finance Corps.\nBarely a week into 2023, and I’ve seen Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano debate Michael Shellenberger and Joe Rogan interview Peter Zeihan. While these media impressions may seem unrelated, a common thread is sewn between the two: experts in different fields confidently professing uninformed opinions on Bitcoin. \nZeihan’s misunderstandings can be heard in the last 20 minutes or so of the interview.
