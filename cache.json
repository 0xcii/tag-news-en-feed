          "description": "Cardano fell to a fresh all-time low on Saturday, as prices plunged by over 10% to start the weekend. The move saw the token drop for a third straight session, as a red wave swept through cryptocurrency markets. Binance coin also moved lower, dropping for a seventh consecutive day.\n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) moved to a fresh all-time low to start the weekend, as prices dropped for a third straight session.\n \nFollowing a high of $0.3011 on Friday, ADA/USD moved to a low of $0.2603 earlier in today’s session.\n \nThe move saw the token plunge by nearly 13% earlier in the day, hitting a new all-time low in the process.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, the drop comes as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed its 25-day (blue) counterpart.\n \nThis signals a shift in price momentum, and comes as the relative strength index (RSI) fell deeper into oversold territory.\n \nAs of writing, the index is tracking at 24.13, which is its weakest point since October 21.\n \n \nBinance Coin (BNB)\n \nBinance coin (BNB) was another notable token to fall today, with prices dropping for a seventh straight session.\n \nRecent declines have come as financial firm Mazars halted its audit of Binance’s reserves.\n \nAs a result of this, BNB/USD fell to a low of $221.00, which comes a day after hitting a high of $264.25.\n \n \nOverall, the token is now down by nearly 20% in the last week, and is down 10.88% as of writing.\n \nSimilar to cardano, the RSI on BNB is currently trading near the 24.00 mark, which is deep in oversold territory.\n \nBNB is currently trading at its lowest point since July 13.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nWhat other factors are behind today’s decline in crypto prices?

          "description": "The BIS’ Basel Committee introduced a finalized proposal for limits to the amount of Tier 1 capital banks can hold in bitcoin.\nThe Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has finalized a proposed policy that would place a 2% limit on banks' Tier 1 capital held in bitcoin. This comes with an endorsement from the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the oversight body of the Basel Committee, which is the “primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks.”\nInvestopedia defines Tier 1 capital as “the core capital held in a bank's reserves [that] is used to fund business activities for the bank's clients. It includes common stock, as well as disclosed reserves and certain other assets.” \nThe policy includes bitcoin in its definition of Group 2 crypto assets, saying that “In addition to any tokenised traditional assets and stablecoins that fail the classification conditions, Group 2 includes all unbacked cryptoassets.” It later describes that “a bank’s total exposure to Group 2 cryptoassets should not generally be higher than 1% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital and must not exceed 2% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital.”\n\nThe BIS had previously considered a policy of 1% for global banks. In turn, the banks requested a 5% reserve limit. This 2% appears to be a compromise between the two. According to data from 2020, if applied to all banks in the world, who collectively custody approximately $180 trillion, this would amount to a limit of $3.6 trillion in bitcoin held by such entities. \nTiff Macklem, Chair of the GHOS, stated that “Today's endorsement by the GHOS marks an important milestone in developing a global regulatory baseline for mitigating risks to banks from cryptoassets. It is important to continue to monitor bank-related developments in cryptoasset markets. We remain ready to act further if necessary.”",
