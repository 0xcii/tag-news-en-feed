But what has become the hot topic was the sudden collapse of FTX, the former largest crypto exchange worldwide. \nNonetheless, it remains an influential figure in the market.

Earlier rulings had  \nindicated conditions favoring Do Kwon's extradition, leaving the final decision  \nin the hands of Justice Minister Andrej Milović.\nHowever, the Court of  \nAppeal clarified that Do Kwon, having consented to expedited extradition  \nproceedings, would be subject to the jurisdiction of the requesting countries. \nLegal Arguments and  \nPolitical Dimensions\nDo Kwon's defense  \nattorney, Goran Rodić, emphasized legal provisions favoring extradition to  \nSouth Korea, citing international agreements and Montenegrin laws. Rodić  \ncontended that prevailing legal frameworks pointed towards South Korea as the  \nappropriate jurisdiction for Do Kwon's extradition.\nHowever, Justice  \nMinister Andrej Milović framed the decision as politically significant,  \nhighlighting the USA's status as a key diplomatic ally. Milović underscored  \nefforts to establish a bilateral extradition agreement, signaling Montenegro's  \ncommitment to bolstering international legal cooperation.\n \n  \n \n  \nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.",
