He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. \"I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,\" he said. \"And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system.\"",

Spurred by an apparent collapse of First Republic Bank, the global crypto market cap moved 7% higher, as of writing. Solana was also in the green, rising by nearly 9%.\n \nCardano (ADA)\n \nCardano (ADA) rose by as much as 9% on Wednesday, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets.\n \nFollowing a low of $0.38 on Tuesday, ADA/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4166 earlier in today’s session.\n \nToday’s surge in price saw cardano climb to its highest point in six days, since when the token was trading above a ceiling at $0.4200.\n \n \nLooking at the chart, Wednesday’s move came as the relative strength index (RSI) broke free of a resistance level at 53.00.\n \nAt the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 55.12, with an upcoming ceiling of 58.00 a potential target for bulls.\n \nShould this point be hit, there is a strong possibility that ADA will move back above its aforementioned point of resistance.\n \n \nSolana (SOL)\n \nAdditionally solana (SOL) was another notable mover on Wednesday, as the token was also nearly 9% higher.\n \nSOL/USD rose to a peak of $22.92 earlier in the day, after almost breaking out of a floor at $20.00 the day prior.\n \nAs a result of today’s gains, solana is now on the cusp of colliding with its long-term ceiling at $23.00.\n \n \nAlthough the RSI has risen above a ceiling at 50.00 in today’s session, it will need to move beyond the 55.00 mark in order to reach the above target.\n \nAs of writing, price strength is tracking at 52.97, with solana now trading at the $22.71 mark.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nCan solana extend today’s rally for the remainder of the week?
