          "description": "Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite acting as twin forces for accelerating and adopting cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, have historically been at odds with each other due to the “L1 wars” and their vocal online proponents. To some, the rivalry may seem like a mere culture war within the crypto community. However at its’ root, it's a reflection of distinct foundational beliefs resulting in divergence.\nLet's delve deeper into these foundational beliefs:\nBitcoin: A Beacon of Decentralization (and Liquidity)\nBitcoin was designed to challenge traditional financial systems, presenting an alternative that removed the need for intermediaries. The support base resonates with this aim, and thus places decentralization as its’ primary criterion. \nAn example of this commitment was the blocksiz…",

Paypal detailed that the stablecoin asset will be available to select Venmo users and fully roll out for all users “in the coming weeks.”\n \nPaypal Stablecoin PYUSD Makes Its Way to Venmo\n \nPaypal has disclosed that Venmo users can now leverage the firm’s proprietary stablecoin, PYUSD. The rollout is starting with select Venmo users, but soon all Venmo customers will be able to “able to purchase PYUSD and send it to friends and family on Paypal, Venmo, and compatible external wallets.”\n \nThe company notes that transfers between Paypal users and Venmo are “fast and free,” with the exception of blockchain network fees. PYUSD is an ERC20 token, which means the coin is subject to fees associated with the Ethereum fee market and block space.\n \nFor example, etherscan.io indicates that the cost to transfer an ERC20 token on September 20, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. (ET), ranges from $2.65 to $2.91 per transaction. Paypal further mentions in the announcement that PYUSD is now available on various platforms, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Kraken, MetaMask, Ledger, Phantom, Bitpay, and Fireblocks, among others.\n \nThe payments company also highlights its recent approval by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The latest development comes on the heels of PYUSD’s first transparency report, which unveiled the backing of cash and U.S. Treasury reverse repurchase agreements as reserves.\n \n \nAs of September 20, approximately 44.37 million PYUSD coins are in circulation. A total of 698 distinct addresses currently hold PYUSD, with these wallets collectively executing 3,354 transfers since the currency’s launch. Additionally, the top 100 holders jointly possess 99.96% of the PYUSD supply, equivalent to 44,358,474.05 PYUSD tokens.\n \nWhat do you think about PYUSD being supported by Venmo?
