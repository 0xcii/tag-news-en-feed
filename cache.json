It takes a certain degree of stubbornness or dogma to get involved in something like Bitcoin this early on and demonstrate the type of conviction necessary to hodl on for the ride.

          "description": "U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed $200 billion in cumulative trading volume since launching just three months ago.\n\nJUST IN: 🇺🇸 US #Bitcoin spot ETFs trading volume surpasses $200 billion within just 3 months. \nAsia is next 🚀 pic.twitter.com/VxQdQJEIjN\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 10, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nAccording to data from The Block, the total volume for the SEC-approved funds crossed the $200 billion milestone on Tuesday. This comes after spot bitcoin ETFs saw a record monthly volume of $111 billion in March, triple that of February.\nThe ETFs debuted on January 11th when bitcoin traded around $45,000. Since then, bitcoin has climbed to an all-time high above $73,000, buoying interest and trading activity.\nBlackRock's IBIT leads the volumes, which now hold over 265,000 bitcoins worth more than $18 billion. IBIT comprises nearly 50% of the total spot ETF volume. Meanwhile, Grayscale's GBTC and Fidelity's FBTC rank second and third in market share.\nThe success of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs has prompted applications in other markets like Hong Kong. Regulators there are expected to approve the first spot bitcoin ETFs in Asia this month, potentially adding more volume.\nETF providers cite surging institutional demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. The funds present an easy vehicle for both retail and professional investors to gain bitcoin price exposure.\nThe $200 billion cumulative volume indicates growing bitcoin's maturation since the last bull run when ETF hopes were repeatedly dashed.\nThe growth of bitcoin ETFs signals widening adoption by traditional finance, a mainstream integration that will likely persist as the asset class evolves.",

          "description": "The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures released by the United States have exceeded expectations, signaling a robust inflationary trend that could significantly influence the Federal Reserve’s forthcoming monetary policy decisions. The Bitcoin and crypto markets reacted with a swift downtrend. The BTC price initially dropped by 2.7%, falling below $67,200. Altcoins have reacted even more strongly to the data.\n \nThe non-seasonally adjusted CPI for March 2024 soared to an annual rate of 3.5%, surpassing both the anticipated figure of 3.4% and February’s rate of 3.2%, marking the highest inflation rate since September 2023. This uptick reflects not just a transient economic fluctuation but a deeper, more sustained inflationary pressure within the economy.\n \n \nThe details of the CPI repo…",
