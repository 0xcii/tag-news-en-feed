Grayscale is also working to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a physically backed ETF but faces a legal challenge with the SEC over its approval. Launched in March 2019, the Ethereum Trust now has an AUM of $4.96 billion, Grayscale’s web portal shows.\n \n \nGrayscale also plans to launch an ethereum futures ETF based on cash-settled CME futures contracts with regulatory approval. David LaValle, Grayscale’s global head of ETFs, said Monday that the filing “is another important milestone as Grayscale continues to build its best-in-class ETF team, product suite, and capabilities – serving investors as a globally respected asset manager with unmatched crypto expertise.”\n \nWhat do you think about Grayscale registering to turn its Ethereum Trust into a spot ether ETF?

Musk, responding to a post asking other X users what they think is a scam so normalized that people don't even realize it is a scam, did not provide further context in the post.\nFiat currency refers to traditional government-issued money, such as the US dollar, euro, or yen, that is not backed by a physical commodity like gold but relies on the trust and authority of the issuing government. Musk's comment adds fuel to the ongoing debate about the role of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in challenging traditional financial systems.\nBitcoin enthusiasts and advocates quickly rallied behind Musk's tweet, interpreting it as an endorsement for the digital currency. They argue that Bitcoin offer an alternative to fiat currency, with advantages of being decentralized and resistant to inflation.\nMusk's statement adds to the growing discussion surrounding the role of Bitcoin in modern finance. While his post was brief, it remains to be seen whether Musk will further elaborate on his views regarding fiat currency or if this is another instance of his cryptic and attention-grabbing social media presence. Regardless, the debate over the future of money and the coexistence of traditional and digital currencies is unlikely to subside anytime soon.",
