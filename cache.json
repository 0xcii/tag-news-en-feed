The global crypto market cap has been largely unchanged, with volatility mostly muted. Stellar also rose higher, avoiding a drop below a key support point. \n \nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n \nBitcoin cash (BCH) rose by as much as 5% to start the week, despite the wider market mostly trading lower.\n \nBCH/USD jumped to a peak of $242.29 earlier in today’s session, following an earlier low of $219.27.\n \nThe move came after BCH briefly broke out of a support point at $220.00, with traders swooping in to buy the dip.\n \n \nAnother catalyst to the surge appears to be the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moving past a ceiling at 48.00.\n \nCurrently, price strength is tracking at 49.48, which is marginally below the next point of resistance at 50.00.\n \nIn the event this level is breached, there is a strong possibility that BCH could move towards $260.00.\n \n \nStellar (XLM)\n \nAdditionally, stellar (XLM) was another token in the green on Monday, as it continued to move away from a floor of $0.1345.\n \nFollowing a low at $0.1380 on Sunday, XLM/USD rallied to an intraday high of $0.1431 earlier in the day.\n \n \nThis is the third straight session that stellar has traded higher, and comes despite a recent downward crossover of moving averages (MA).\n \nAs can be seen from the chart, the 10-day (red) MA moved below its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which is typically a bearish signal.\n \nEven though momentum has shown signs of weakness, XLM bulls will likely continue to target exits at a ceiling of $0.1600.\n \nRegister your email here to get weekly price analysis updates sent to your inbox:\n \nAre there any fundamentals behind stellar’s rally?
