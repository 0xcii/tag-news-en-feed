The companies invite all Bitcoiners to attempt to crack that bitcoin wallet and claim all of its sats. \nThe announcement sent to Bitcoin Magazine describes how brute forcing will be the method that will allow participants to crack the seed, saying “For this game, brute-forcing a bitcoin wallet means finding the seed words and a passphrase, in this case, arranging them in the right order and using the resulting backup as a way to recover the wallet’s funds. There are many ways to achieve this and general knowledge about bitcoin wallets, script types, derivation paths, checksums, passphrases and BIP-39 seed words will be helpful … As more words are revealed, brute-forcing gets easier, so time is ticking as people from around the world compete to crack the wallet.”\nA 12-word, passphrase-protected bitcoin address (BIP39) generated a BTC address which now holds the sats up for grabs. Each word from the wallet, including the passphrase, were shared with the 12 partners. Over the week starting with January 23, each partners will share their word using the hashtag #HuntingSats. At the end of the week, if no one has successfully accessed the bitcoin, more hints will be shared. \n\nThe partners involved include: \n\nBTCPay\nTrezor \nCryptosteel\nBlockstream\nBull Bitcoin.\nHodl Hodl\nBitcoin Reserve\nCoinkite\nSwan Bitcoin\nBTCTKVR\nmempool.space\nWizardsardine\n\nFor all general information regarding the contest, including updates about the words that have been revealed to the public, visit HuntingSats.com.",
