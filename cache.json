When Bitcoin first launched, mining rewards were 50 BTC. Currently, that figure is 6.25 BTC, and after the next halving, it will be reduced to 3.125 BTC.\n The halving occurs every 210,000 blocks rather than on pre-specified dates, but this corresponds to a roughly four-year cycle, which means that the next reduction in issuance should reach us this April. Notably, a glance at BTC’s price action since inception reveals a repeating pattern of vertical gains, deep corrections, and drawn-out recoveries, and this sequence appears to correspond closely with the halvings, leading among bitcoin traders to an entrenched belief in halving-driven movements.\n However, as Bit…",

          "description": "Today at 11:30a in Waco, Texas, the Texas Blockchain Council and Riot Platforms, Inc., asked a Federal District Judge Alan Albright for a temporary restraining order blocking the Energy Information Administration from enforcing their \"emergency\" survey.\nAt that hearing, the attorneys for the Government offered a voluntary declaration by EIA Administrator DeCarolis, offering a four-week pause on enforcement and collection. Judge Albright, recognizing that the Government's offer here was little more than an empty promise without some sort of enforcement mechanism, directed the Government to work with the Plaintiffs to craft a negotiated order that would fully bind the Government to:\n\nTake down the survey for the agreed four-week period;\nProvide notice that anyone who hasn't yet complied, that they don't need to comply right now; and\nProvide an affirmation that any information which has been received so far, or which is received in the interim, shall be sequestered and not utilized by the Agency.\n\nAlso, this order will be National in scope, so every miner in the US is covered.\nIf the Government can't reach an agreement by 3pm Central today, the Judge indicated that he would issue a Temporary Restraining Order with the same effect as the above, but would accelerate the timetable to the permanent injunction hearing.\nWe'll know more in a few hours when the final order is entered, but it looks like for now at least, the EIA has been stalled in their (allegedly illegal) \"emergency\" data collection.\nHere is a link to the case files.\nThis is a guest post by Colin Crossman.
