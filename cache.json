Sequential execution ensures that transactions and smart contracts can be executed in a deterministic order, making it easier to manage and predict the blockchain's state. This design choice prioritizes security, reducing potential complexities and vulnerabilities associated with parallel execution. However, under high loads of transaction requests, this sequential execution can lead to network congestion and delays, similar to a single-lane highway.\nIs it feasible to s…",

Kendrick highlighted that the next significant driver for Bitcoin's price would be the U.S. election.\nKendrick also noted that Bitcoin could reach a new record over the weekend if the nonfarm payrolls report, to be released on Friday, is favorable. Bitcoin's current all time high, set on March 14, stands at $73,770. A positive jobs report could pave the way for Bitcoin to reach $80,000 later this month, he noted.\nThe forecast underscores the significant impact political developments can have on the Bitcoin market. With over 50 million Bitcoin and crypto holders in the United States, the outcome of the presidential election is poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future of Bitcoin.",

The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025.\n\nBREAKING: ROBINHOOD BUYS #BITCOIN AND CRYPTO EXCHANGE BITSTAMP FOR $200 MILLION. pic.twitter.com/Q9LfBDw3Di\n— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 6, 2024\n  \n  \n  \nFounded in 2011, Bitstamp is one of the world's oldest and most established crypto exchanges. It operates across Europe, Asia and the U.S., with over 50 licenses globally. The acquisition will bring Bitstamp's institutional and retail customers under Robinhood's umbrella.\nRobinhood aims to leverage Bitstamp's reputation for resilience and trust to bolster its own Bitcoin and crypto offerings. Bitstamp underwent over a decade of market cycles and maintained high-security standards. \nThe purchase comes as Robinhood faces scrutiny from the SEC over its crypto division. However, Bitcoin and crypto remain a key driver of growth, with transaction revenue from crypto trading jumping 40% last year. Acquiring an established platform like Bitstamp could significantly expand Robinhood's global reach.\nRobinhood general manager Johann Kerbrat said the deal is a \"major step in growing our crypto business\" and will help Robinhood \"expand our footprint outside of the U.S. and welcome institutional customers.\" Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev says, \"We believe crypto will fundamentally reorganize the financial system.\"\nRobinhood has already been offering Bitcoin and crypto trading services in the EU. But buying Bitstamp provides a ready-made base of customers and regulatory licensing across multiple jurisdictions.  As Bitcoin demand increases, the acquisition positions Robinhood to capture growing trading volumes.",
