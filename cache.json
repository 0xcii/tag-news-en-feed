          "description": "The Bitcoin price has observed a surge back above the $71,000 level during the past day as buyers appear to have returned on Coinbase.\n \nBitcoin Coinbase Premium Has Witnessed A Large Positive Spike\n \nAs explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the BTC Coinbase Premium Index has registered a high value recently. The “Coinbase Premium Index” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the percentage difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).\n \nWhen the value of this metric is positive, it means the price of the cryptocurrency listed on Coinbase is greater than on Binance right now. Such a trend implies the presence of a higher buying pressure (or just a lower selling pressure) on the former exchange than the latter one.\n …",
