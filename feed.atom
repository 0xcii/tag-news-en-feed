        <updated>2023-01-27T16:59:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Texas Senator has introduced a resolution requesting Capitol vendors to accept bitcoin.
Sen. Ted Cruz (TX-R) has proposed a resolution that would request vendors within the Capitol area to work with payments providers that accept bitcoin.
The proposal specifically mentions that restaurants, gift shops and vending machines within Capitol Buildings should work with persons accepting cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which would allow the lawmakers of the United States to purchase their on-the-go snacks with sound money as they please. 
Sen. Ted Cruz has been an outspoken advocate for bitcoin before, saying that, “One of the reasons I’m bullish on Bitcoin is because it’s decentralized. The Left hates Bitcoin because they can’t control it.”



Sen. Cruz also sees the benefits of bitcoin mining as a potential boon for Texas, a state which has been at the forefront of the industry since China’s bitcoin mining ban and subsequent hash rate exodus in 2021.



While the move for acceptance at vendors may be perceived as inconsequential, if it passes, it could serve as the first primary exposure for Capitol politicians to using BTC as a daily payment method. Bitcoin can be an abstract concept for those who have not seen its usage in a payments setting, so small resolutions like this can possibly shift perspectives for an on-the-fence politician. The resolution will need to pass both the House and Senate in order to take effect.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-01-27T16:42:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon rose to its highest level since early November on Friday, as markets reacted to the latest U.S. consumer sentiment data. Sentiment rose to 64.9 in January, up from a reading of 59.7 in December. Chainlink also surged in today’s session, hitting its strongest point in nearly two months.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was a big gainer on Friday, as prices rose to their highest point in 11 weeks.
 
Following a low of $1.07 on Thursday, MATIC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1.15 earlier today.
 
As a result of this, polygon moved to its strongest point since November 11, which is the last time prices were trading at this point of resistance.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge took place when the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 69.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 72.14, and appears to be en route to a ceiling at the 77.00 mark.
 
Should this occur, there is a strong possibility that MATIC will be trading above the $1.20 mark.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Another notable mover on Friday was chainlink (LINK), which also surged to a multi-month high.
 
LINK/USD jumped to a high of $7.33 earlier in the day, which comes less than a day after falling to a low of $6.93.
 
This rally in price pushed chainlink to its highest point since December 5, breaking it out of a price ceiling in the process.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, LINK climbed past its resistance level of $7.25, however the RSI was unable to also achieve this feat.
 
Price strength is currently at a reading of 64.15, which is marginally below a ceiling at 65.00.

SHIB is one of those tokens that has climbed hard because of its high correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Along with the news of the token’s network upgrade being hyped up, SHIB’s rise is a sure win for investors and traders. 
 

 
However, the token has recently entered a sideways market movement ahead of its Shibarium upgrade. Can Shiba Inu continue its rally or will it experience pain?

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Polygon, Aave, and Dydx have all rallied along with high whale activity recently. The relevant indicator here is the “whale transaction count,” which measures the total number of transfers that whales are making right now.
 
In the context of these altcoins, the condition for a transaction to count as one coming from whales is that it should involve a movement of coins worth at least $100,000.

        <updated>2023-01-27T15:10:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin network is set to record another meaningful difficulty increase on Sunday, Jan. 29, 2023, as current estimates expect it to rise 3.82% higher. The change follows the last difficulty retarget, which advanced by 10.26% to the current all-time high of 37.59 trillion.
 
Block Time Breakdown: How Faster Discovery is Impacting Bitcoin Difficulty
 
In just over a day, the Bitcoin network will see a difficulty increase of around 3.82%, according to current estimates. Right now, the mining difficulty is already at an all-time high (ATH) at 37.59 trillion, and with a 3.82% jump, it’s expected to be around 39.03 trillion. The number of hashes needed to mine a block is directly proportional to the difficulty level, which means each participating miner needs to perform 39.03 trillion hashes in order to mine a block at that level.
 
 
The average Bitcoin block time has been around 8:54 minutes to 9:31 minutes, which has been lower than the 10-minute average. This too is linearly related to the estimated increase expected on Jan. 29.
 
 
This is because when blocks are discovered faster than the 10-minute average, the 2,016 blocks in between difficulty retargets are also found faster than the two-week average. As a result, the Bitcoin protocol’s mining difficulty rises. With BTC’s price higher, a lot more hashrate has been dedicated to the blockchain.
 
 
Bitcoin’s hashrate is running high with an average of 278.2 exahash per second (EH/s) during the last 2,016 blocks. Foundry USA commands the top position in terms of mining pools with the most amount of dedicated SHA256 hashrate. Foundry has around 93.82 EH/s, over a three-day period, which accounts for 32.99% of the network’s computational power. The Bitcoin mining pool Antpool has dedicated 49.57 EH/s to the Bitcoin network over a three-day span, accounting for 17.43% of the hashpower.
 
What impact do you think this difficulty increase will have on the overall Bitcoin network and its miners? Share your thoughts in the comments below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated on Friday, as traders prepared for the release of the upcoming consumer sentiment figures from the United States. Following a move to a five-month high on Thursday, prices were once again below $23,000. Ethereum also slipped, moving below $1,600 in the process.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell back below $23,000 on Friday, as markets consolidated ahead of U.S. consumer sentiment data.
 
BTC/USD slipped to a bottom of $22,654.59 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $23,215.00.
 
The drop came ahead of this afternoon’s U.S. consumer sentiment report, which is expected to come in at a reading of 64.6.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) also edged closer to a floor of 78.00, leading to a slight shift in momentum.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average continues to move in an upward direction, however should the index move below 78.00, this trend will likely reverse.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 79.64, with BTC/USD trading at $22,965.60.
 
 
Ethereum
 
There was a slight shift in sentiment in ethereum (ETH), with prices moving below $1,600 during today’s session.
 
Following a high of $1,619.45 on Thursday, ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,565.25 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s move came as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency was unable to break out of a resistance level of $1,640 on Wednesday.
 
 
Since this time, prices have moved to lower lows in back-to-back sessions, with ethereum’s RSI also dropping below a key point of support.
 
The index is tracking at 61.94, which is marginally under its recent floor at 63.00, and its weakest level since January 8.
 
Should this bearish trend continue into the weekend, there is a strong possibility that ETH will hit a floor at $1,500.
