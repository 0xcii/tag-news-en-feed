United Kingdom. This is in response to the upcoming regulatory changes imposed  
by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
According to a report by Coindesk, the crypto platform will  
phase out cashback payouts for transactions on Nexo Exchange and Nexo Card and  
terminate their referral and affiliate programs, effective October 8. 
This move aligns with the FCA's stringent promotion rules  
for the cryptocurrency industry, requiring companies to be registered for  
self-approval of advertisements and to modify their systems, such as allowing  
first-time buyers a minimum of 24 hours to reconsider their investment decisions.

As usual, investors have seen successes using these different methods but the argument remains about whether it is better to hold a coin or to continuously trade it. Along this line, a crypto analyst has come forward with their own research on which is the better of the two.
 
Better To Invest And Hold
 
In an X (formerly Twitter) post, an analyst outlined why it is better to buy and hold XRP rather than to try trade it for higher profits. He points out that buying and holding XRP over the last five years would yield better results than trying to use an indicator investors believe would bring more profits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum snapped a four-day losing streak on Friday, as markets reacted to the latest nonfarm payrolls in the United States. Payrolls came in at 336,000, which is nearly double the 170,000 jobs many thought would be added in September. Bitcoin retreated from a brief stint above the $28,000 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) had a brief stint above the $28,000 level late on Thursday, as market volatility increased ahead of today’s nonfarm payrolls report.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $28,091.86 towards the tail end of yesterday’s session, before slipping to a bottom of $27,375.60 earlier today.
 
Prices have since rebounded, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency now trading at $27,649.56 as of writing.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
BTC retreated from yesterday’s high after the relative strength index (RSI) failed to sustain a surge above a key resistance level of 60.00.
 
The index is currently at a reading of 58.95, however there could be another attempt to move beyond 60.00 in the coming hours.
 
In the event that the next advance is successful, there is a strong possibility bitcoin will be back trading above $28,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) returned to the green in today’s session, following a spell of four consecutive days trading lower.
 
After hitting a one-week low of $1,608 on Thursday, ETH/USD rose to a peak of $1,649.13 earlier in the day.
 
This came as bulls opted to reenter the market following a breakout below a support point at the $1,620 level.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Earlier gains have somewhat faded, as ETH approached a ceiling near the 50.00 level on the RSI indicator.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 48.93, with ethereum trading at $1,634, and bulls maintaining a target of $1,700 in the short-term.
