This is an opinion article by Guglielmo Cecero, the legal manager of European bitcoin investment app Relai, and Raphael Schoen, the content lead at Relai.

Total Value Locked In Ethereum DeFi Now Only Around $23.1 Billion
 
Decentralized Finance (or DeFi as it’s most commonly known) includes all types of financial services that are done on the blockchain. Like other entities on the blockchain, DeFi is public and doesn’t involve any centralized party to get things done (as transactions are peer-to-peer).
 
The “total value locked” (TVL) is a metric that measures the total amount of capital that has currently been deposited by users in DeFi protocols. The below chart shows how the TVL of DeFi built on the Ethereum blockchain has changed over the course of the year 2022:

Consequently, World Gold Council (WGC) statistics show the demand for gold by central banks has risen at the fastest pace in 55 years. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo’s head of real asset strategy, John LaForge, contends that when silver starts outperforming gold, it usually signals it is “closer to a bull market in precious metals versus the other way.”
 
The World’s Central Banks Are Hoarding Large Sums of Gold, China Recently Purchased 32 Tons of the Precious Metal
 
Precious metals like gold and silver are ending the year a lot higher in value than they were 56 days ago on Nov. 3, 2022. Close to two months ago, on that day, a troy ounce of .999 fine gold was trading for $1,629 p…]]></summary>

This news comes from the nascent NFT space, which is gaining momentum and breaking new records. Just in early November, Ripple CTO David Schwartz announced the launch of XRPL’s own standard for NFTs on the mainnet, which was activated with amendment XLS-20.
 
Citing Bithomp, the founder of the XRPL-based NFT marketplace onXRP, Kaj Leroy, today announced that all sales on the platform exceeded a volume of 7.3 million XRP, equivalent to about $2.45 million. This makes onXRP by far the most popular NFT marketplace on the XRP Ledg…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman has joined the ranks of the world’s intellectuals and business moguls to give the thumbs-down to cryptocurrency.
 
Last June, the American economist drew parallels between the cryptocurrency craze and the real estate bubble of the mid-2000s, stating that consumers’ belief in crypto assets is comparable to their enthusiasm in the US home market prior to its collapse.
 
Fast forward six months, Krugman has compared the crypto to Tesla and its stocks.
 
On Tuesday, Krugman wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times regarding Tesla, bitcoin, and their massive market prices.
 
 
In his article, he inquired:
 

“Did the Tesla story ever make sense?” 
 
He added:
 

“Tesla and bitcoin may have more in common than you think.”

Investors have filed a lawsuit against embattled Gemini and its founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, accusing them of fraud and other crimes, reports disclosed Tuesday.
 
A group of investors filed a class-action lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, claiming that the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange offered unregistered securities in the form of interest-bearing accounts.
