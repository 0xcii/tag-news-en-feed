The altcoin’s initial pump tapered off in a few days but XRP continues to retain most of those gains. Given the cryptocurrency’s performance trend over this time, crypto analysts believe that the digital asset could be poised for a massive rally and they have given reasons why.
 
A Repeat Of 2017?
 
One crypto analyst that has pointed to the possibility of an XRP rally is CryptoInsightUK. The pseudonymous analyst posted two side-by-side XRP/BTC charts on X (formerly Twitter) to show the similarities between both trends. One chart was from 2017 while the other was from 2023.

Economists attribute the ruble’s latest plunge to the effectiveness of a price cap imposed on Russian oil by Western countries. Russ Mould said a strengthening U.S. dollar could be the reason why the Russian currency has struggled against the greenback in the past few months. 
 
Impact of the Oil Price Cap
 
On Aug. 14, the Russian currency’s exchange rate versus the greenback dropped to a new low of just over 100 rubles for every dollar. The currency’s latest plunge means the ruble has now depreciated by over 8% in the past month and by more than 20% since the start of 2023.

inability to serve its customers. Additionally, a prospective acquisition by

The decision to undertake this action is in line with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s endeavors to achieve stability for its own currency, which has been experiencing significant devaluation.
 
The official introduction of GBDT was first made in May, in response to the urgent demand for dependable and feasible market-driven resolutions.
