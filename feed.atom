        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Attorney General Letitia James has issued a ban on CoinEx, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange, prohibiting its operations within the state of New York. The ban follows an announcement on June 15 revealing that the exchange’s funds, totaling over $1.7 million, were seized.
 
The seizure was conducted due to allegations of CoinEx’s failure to register as a securities and commodities brokerage, as required by regulation in the United States. A proposed settlement was recently filed in a New York state court in Manhattan, awaiting the judge’s approval.
 
 
The settlement outlines the terms and conditions for CoinEx, the Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange. Specifically, the exchange would be barred from offering, selling, or purchasing securities and commodities in New York.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock, the worlds largest asset manager, has filed an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund). 
In their pursuit of a Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock has chosen Coinbase Custody as their trusted custodial solution. The proposed ETF will be benchmarked against indices provided by CF Benchmarks. The indices will be comprised of price data from six exchanges: Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Bitstamp, itBit, and LMAX Digital.
It is worth noting that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulatory authority responsible for overseeing ETFs in the United States, has thus far rejected every application for a spot bitcoin ETF. Nevertheless, the commission has granted approval for several bitcoin futures ETFs, which have been successfully introduced for trading.
BlackRock's filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF signals a turning point in the industry, as a prominent player in the traditional financial space acknowledges the potential of Bitcoin. If approved, the Bitcoin ETF would open doors to a new wave of adoption and provide investors with an unprecedented opportunity to participate in the Bitcoin market through a regulated and accessible investment vehicle.]]></summary>

Celsius Plans to Convert 15 Different Tokens to Bitcoin and Ethereum
 
In mid-February 2023, Celsius announced it would be acquired by Novawulf Digital Management to execute the reorganization plan. The firm filed its plan on June 15, and as per the latest revisions, customers who possess “altcoins” will have their balances converted to BTC and ETH on July 1.

Cuban And Stark Clash Over Judge’s Remarks In Binance Case
 
Cuban argued that not all crypto businesses with tokens or considering using tokens are large “enterprises,” as Stark had assumed. He pointed out that most crypto applications are small, with only a few people involved.

Bitcoin Dominance Has Gone Up By 7.6% Since The Start Of 2023
 
As the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode pointed out, alts are being constantly rotated into the original cryptocurrency. The “dominance” here refers to the percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap that the market cap of Bitcoin alone accounts for.
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that the market share of the cryptocurrency is growing right now. Such a trend can indicate that investors prefer to invest in the asset over the current altcoins.
 
On the other hand, decreasing values of the indicator can be a sign that the holders are relatively losing interest in BTC as the market ca…]]></summary>
