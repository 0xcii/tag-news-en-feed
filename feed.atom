        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, investors have been eagerly awaiting a Spot Bitcoin ETF to gain institutional and mainstream exposure to the digital asset. Several applications have already been rejected by the SEC citing concerns over the nascent market being too risky for investors. However, the applications have gained momentum in recent months, with many now expecting a green light from the SEC.
 
Bitcoin Price Could Jump 500%
 
While speaking in an interview with CNBC, Fundstrat co-founder Tom Fundstrat shared his optimistic prediction regarding Bitcoin. According to the company’s head of research, spot ETFs could increase BTC’s demand in relation to its supply, pushing it to $150,000 or maybe even further by the end of next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu fell lower for a fifth straight session on Thursday, resulting in the meme coin dropping to a 13-day low. Since hitting a four-month high last Saturday, SHIB has struggled to find a firm floor. On the other hand, Solana ended a recent losing streak.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was a notable gainer on Thursday, as the meme coin moved lower for a fifth consecutive day.
 
SHIB/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.000008543 earlier in today’s session, following a peak of $0.000009854 the day prior.
 
This decline pushed SHIB to its lowest point since August 4, when price traded at a low of $0.00000827.
 
 
The latest drop comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell below a support point of 50.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.31, with a floor of 39.00 the next possible target.
 
In the event it reaches this target, SHIB will likely be trading below $0.000008000.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
On the other hand, solana (SOL) returned to the green during today’s session, snapping a two-day losing streak in the process.
 
Following a low of $22.49 on Wednesday, SOL/USD climbed to an intraday high of $23.58 earlier in the day.
 
The move comes as bullish pressure resurfaced, following a marginal breakout below a support point at $22.50.
 
 
This rebound comes following a recent upward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving average.
 
Despite this, there is still a high level of market uncertainty, as price strength hovers close to a key floor at 44.00.
 
Should it break out of this point, SOL could move below $22.00.

cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, has agreed to settle its claims dispute with  
equally bankrupt digital asset lender, Genesis, by accepting a payment of $175  
million to Alameda Research, its affiliated insolvent crypto hedge fund.  
Earlier in May, FTX had sought court permission to recover approximately $3.673  
billion in alleged transfers it made to Genesis between August 13 and November  
11, 2022.

This meteoric rise has sent shockwaves through the crypto sphere, raising questions about the sustainability of such explosive growth. Amidst a broader slowdown in the crypto market, analytics firm Santiment has turned its gaze towards HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu. 
 
 
As market momentum appears to wane, Santiment suggests that while some blockchain projects might regain their footing as loss transactions accumulate, the overall landscape remains uncertain.

Crypto Futures Liquidations In Past 24 Hours Have Reached $153 Million
 
The crypto market has observed some significant volatility during the past day, as many assets including Bitcoin have taken a notable hit. This volatility in spot prices has also caused chaos in the futures market, where a mass amount of liquidations has piled up.
 
A contract is said to be “liquidated” when the derivative platform with which said contract is open forcibly closes it due to it amassing losses of a specific percentage (which may differ from exchange to exchange).

This platform is designed to bolster decentralized app growth while tackling Ethereum’s scalability and transaction fee challenges. Yet, even amidst the celebrations, SHIB, the project’s native cryptocurrency, slid over 8% against the U.S. dollar, mirroring the larger crypto market’s decline. Adding to the concerns, complications arose with the Shibarium bridge, leaving roughly $1.7 million in ether seemingly in a state of suspension.

North Korea, an enigmatic nation, has since been suspected of orchestrating extensive cyber heists, primarily focusing on the digital asset sector. A recent report indicates that North Korean hackers have pilfered roughly $180 million worth of crypto within just the first six months of this year.

South Korea’s National Intelligence Service unveiled these alarming figures during a press briefing, which were subsequently reported by Asia Today, a prominent local news agency.

Firstly and generally speaking, it’s a type of money, like paper currency or fiat money, that stands in contrast with hard money. Hard money has physicality, like gold, silver or any other metal-coined money, or it is hard coded to be scarce, like bitcoin. 
Soft currency is often used instead of soft money, they are interchangeable in the economic sense as they both refer to a currency that is not backed by a tangible commodity and whose value is based on government regulation and public confidence. The only nuanced difference is that soft currencies are often associated with countries that have weak or unstable economies, high inflation rates, or political turmoil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin extended recent declines on Thursday, as the cryptocurrency moved towards a two-month low. Bearish sentiment increased following the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, where the Federal Reserve hinted at further rate hikes. Ethereum fell below $1,800 today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) neared a two-month low during today’s session, as traders continued to react to the latest FOMC minutes report.
 
Following a high of $29,192.26 on hump-day, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $28,376.50 earlier in the day.
 
This was the weakest point that bitcoin had fallen to since June 21, when it was at a low of $28,271.
 
 
The drop comes as a recent upwards crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages has reversed course.
 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) has plunged deeper into oversold territory, and is now tracking at 35.05.
 
This is its lowest level since March, and should momentum continue to fall, price could end up at a floor of $27,600.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Bearish sentiment was also high in ethereum (ETH), which fell to a multi-month low of its own on Thursday.
 
ETH/USD bottomed out at $1,783.05 on Thursday, less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $1,826.82.
 
As a result of this sell-off, ethereum slipped to its lowest point since June 20, when it almost moved under the $1,700 mark.
 
 
Ethereum’s RSI is also currently hovering in bear territory, with a reading at 33.67, and appears to be angling to reach a floor at 30.00.
 
Should it reach this point, ethereum will likely be trading around a long-term support point of $1,750.
