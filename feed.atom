        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a dramatic turn of events, Genesis, the now-bankrupt  
crypto lender, has brought its entire crypto trading venture to an abrupt halt.  
The decision to cease all trading operations, including its international spot

Gemini.
Genesis Global Trading,  
a subsidiary of Genesis Global, recently announced plans to close its U.S.-focused spot crypto  
trading operations by the end of this month, a report by Coindesk indicated.  
GGT will cease its over-the-counter trading platform's operations on September

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a report by Reuters, German banking giant Deutsche Bank has partnered with Swiss cryptocurrency firm Taurus to offer Bitcoin and crypto custody and other related services to its institutional clients.
"As the digital asset space is expected to encompass trillions of dollars of assets, it's bound to be seen as one of the priorities for investors and corporations alike," said Deutsche Bank's global head of securities services, Paul Maley. "Our focus is not just on cryptocurrencies, but supporting our clients in the overall digital assets ecosystem."
The announcement also comes at a time when regulatory clarity around the industry is improving. Governments and financial regulators worldwide have been working to establish clear guidelines for the use and trading of digital assets.
According to the report, Deutsche Bank is proceeding "cautiously and in line with the spirit and the letter of the regulations governing this asset class." Maley went on to further explain that "Our product design, and the nature of custody for clients, will make sure that there isn’t the risk of contaminating the bank’s other activities."
Bitcoin continues to gain momentum and recognition as a legitimate asset class, with the asset becoming a very attractive investment option for hedge funds, family offices, and other institutional investors. Deutsche Bank's decision to enter this market is seen as a strategic move to capture a share of this burgeoning market.]]></summary>

Bitcoin Miners’ Issuance Now Only Makes A Small Part Of Daily Realized Value
 
In a new report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has studied the different components that contribute to Bitcoin’s “realized cap.” The realized cap is a capitalization model for the asset that assumes that the real value of any coin in circulation is the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain.
 
This is different from the normal market cap, which simply takes every token’s value to be the same: the current spot price. Since the last transaction price of a coin is essentially its “buying price,” the realized cap serves as a measure of the aggregate value stored ins…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-14T15:47:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The case against bankrupt crypto lender Celsius took a new turn as one of its former executives came forward. According to a report from Reuters, Roni Cohen-Pavon, ex-Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) at the company, pleaded guilty to criminal charges.
 
 
Celsius Former Executive Pleads Guilty, What Are The Implications
 
The report indicates that Cohen-Pavon attended a hearing today, September 14th, with US District Judge John Koeltl. At the hearing, the former Celsius executive pleaded guilty to manipulating the price of a crypto token, CEL, and four other counts.
 
Cohen-Pavon is one of the Celsius executives under legal scrutiny due to its involvement with the collapse of the crypto lender. The former CRO at this company was charged with the founder and CEO, Alex Mashinsky, in July 2023.
 
Unlike Cohen-Pavon, Mashinsky pleaded not guilty during his hearing. The former executive is expecting a sentence on December 11, 2024. It is unclear, but likely, that today’s events were motivated by an agreement.
 
In the US judicial system, individuals often plead guilty to certain charges when they reach a deal with US law enforcement in exchange for information that could help them get another conviction. The most likely target is Mashinsky.
 
As Bitcoinist reported, following Mashinsky’s arrest and not-guilty plea, the Celsius founder posted bail and now awaits trial. Just yesterday, the crypto founder tried to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
 
The Celsius former CEO has been accused of co-mingling, using his clients’ assets for his gain, and running an alleged fraudulent scheme. Celsius’ case has been heavily linked to that of the failed crypto exchange FTX and the collapse of the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem during the worst part of the “Crypto Winter” in 2022.
 
 
As of this writing, the CEL token trades at $0.10 after a significant downside price action pushed it from its 2023 highs north of $0.7.

        <updated>2023-09-14T15:40:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tron was a big mover on Thursday, as recent reports suggest that the blockchain platform has been processing an average of 4.8 million daily transactions. The token has now surged higher for three consecutive sessions, and looks set to collide with a key resistance level. Solana was also in the green today.
 
Tron (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) rose to a multi-week high on Thursday, on the back of reports claiming that the blockchain sees nearly 5 million daily transactions.
 
TRX/USD peaked at $0.08322 earlier in the day, which comes following a low of $0.08043 the day before.
 
As a result of today’s gains, tron has now risen to its highest point since July 30, when price traded at a high of $0.08395.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that bulls are attempting to reach a ceiling at $0.08600, however a hurdle on the relative strength index (RSI) seems to be preventing this.
 
Price strength is currently tracking at 67.89, which is marginally below a ceiling at the 68.00 level.
 
In order for bulls to capture their price target, this aforementioned resistance point will need to be broken.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rose for a third consecutive day on Thursday, as price moved closer to the coveted $20.00 mark.
 
SOL/USD surged by as much as 5% in today’s session, hitting an intraday peak of $19.27 in the process.
 
This move comes a day after the world’s ninth largest cryptocurrency traded at a bottom of $17.96.
 
 
Earlier gains in price have started to ease in the last few hours, after the RSI closed in on a ceiling of 43.00.
 
At the time of writing, it is at a reading of 41.05, with the token marginally below today’s high, sitting at $18.84.
 
Although $20.00 is still clearly the short-term target, it will likely take a significant amount of bullish momentum to get there.
