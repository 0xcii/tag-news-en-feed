Such “walks” might prove to be pernicious to the banking system, as they cannot be stopped and have effects on credit availability.
 
What Are ‘Bank Walks’?
 
Bank walks, so called by analysts due to their slow action when compared to bank runs, are slow movements of deposits caused by the constant search for higher yields.
