With oil reserves dwindling at a breakneck pace, OPEC’s spare capacity restrained, and powerhouse consumers like China and India snapping up record quantities of Russian crude at discounted rates, a confluence of these factors is signaling the likelihood of an enduring escalation in oil prices, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warns in its August report.

According to the IEA’s projections, the world’s thirst for oil is set to swell by 2.2 million barrels per day (mb/d), reaching a new peak of 102.2 mb/d in 2023. In stark contrast, OPEC+ saw its supply contract by …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu surged to a multi-month high on Saturday, as the meme coin extended its recent run of bullish momentum. The rally began as a result of the hopes surrounding its upcoming layer 2 launch. Dogecoin also extended recent gains to start the weekend.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was one of the notable gainers during Saturday’s session, as price surged to a multi-month high.
 
Following a low of $0.00001001 on Friday, SHIB/USD rallied to a peak of $0.00001127 earlier in the day.
 
The move came as SHIB surged for a fifth straight day, climbing to its strongest point since April in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the latest rally occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) moved past a ceiling of 65.00.
 
Currently, price strength is at a reading of 74.27, with the next visible resistance zone at the 76.00 mark.
 
Should bulls hit this target, SHIB could possibly hit $0.00001200.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) also raced higher during the weekend, as it too remained in the green for a fifth consecutive session.
 
DOGE/USD jumped to an intraday high of $0.07715 on Saturday, which came after a low of $0.07517 the day prior.
 
This resulted in the cryptocurrency climbing to its strongest level since August 2, when price peaked at $0.0786.
 
 
Similar to shiba inu, the dogecoin move came as price strength broke out of a resistance level of 55.00.
 
A ceiling of 60.00 now awaits bulls, in the event they are able to maintain this week’s momentum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was back in the green to start the weekend, after bulls rejected a breakout below $29,000 during Friday’s session. The cryptocurrency continues to hover around a key support level, without either bulls or bears taking control. Ethereum was also marginally higher.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) returned to the green on Saturday, as traders of the cryptocurrency rejected a breakout of a key price level.
 
Following a low of $29,253.52 on Friday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak of $29,517.77 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move comes as the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap began to consolidate, following a recent move above $30,000.
 
 
Bitcoin surged earlier this week, as markets reacted to Moody’s downgrading the credit rating of several U.S. banks.
 
Today’s consolidation occurred just as the relative strength index (RSI) flatlined around a support point near 49.00.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at a reading of 48.70, with earlier gains in BTC somewhat fading.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) was also marginally higher to start the weekend, snapping a three-day losing streak in the process.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,855.07 so far during Saturday’s session, following Friday’s low at the $1,839.57 level.
 
This is the first time since Tuesday that ethereum has climbed higher, and comes as profit taking from this week’s high seems to have ended.
 
 
In order for momentum to once again shift, ethereum will need to break out of a ceiling at 50.00 on the RSI.
 
Price strength is currently tracking at 47.45.
