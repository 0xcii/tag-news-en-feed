Another person people are curious about these days is Alameda Research’s ex-co-CEO Sam Trabucco. The 30-year-old executive left Alameda in Aug. 2022, but since Ellison detailed misconduct happened in 2019, it’s assumed that Trabucco knows a thing or two about what happened.
 
Spotlights Remain on a Few More FTX and Alameda Execs Like Sam Trabucco

In the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances. 
 
We kicked us this special with an institutional guest, asset management firm Blofin. In early December, they wrote an essay called “Catastrophe, Survival, and Evolution: Writing After November’s Crypto Markets” which inspired this series.
