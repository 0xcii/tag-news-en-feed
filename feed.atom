        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, SEC Chair Gary Gensler took to X (Twitter) to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper. 
Gensler, who was nominated by President Biden to serve as SEC Chair in 2021, celebrated the publication of the original Bitcoin white paper by the pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, along with a message that read, "If Satoshi Nakamoto went as Satoshi Nakamoto for Halloween, would we be able to tell? Happy 15th anniversary to Satoshi’s famous white paper that started crypto."
This unexpected celebration of the Bitcoin white paper by the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has sparked intrigue and discussion among Bitcoin enthusiasts and investors, as the SEC has to make decisions on multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications soon. Some of the worlds largest financial institutions, notably $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, are hoping to become the first applicants in the country to get approval for this product.
The 15th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper is significant as it marked the birth of a new era in finance and technology. Bitcoin has since challenged traditional financial systems and institutions, amassing over $670 billion in market cap as of today, and became a national currency. 
More information on the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF race can be found here.]]></summary>

Bitcoin Social Volume Of Bearish Terms Has Surged Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the crowd on social media has started to turn bearish around Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.
 
The relevant indicator here is the “social volume,” which keeps track of the total amount of unique posts/messages/threads on the major social media platforms that mention a given term or topic.
 
 
By “unique,” what’s meant here is that every post that mentions the term is only counted once, regardless of how many total mentions it may make. Because of this limitation, the social volume can provide a more accurate picture of how the trend …]]></summary>

The “open interest” here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts open on all derivative exchanges in the sector. The metric naturally accounts for both short and long positions.
 
When the value of this indicator rises, it means that the investors are opening up more positions on the futures market right now. Generally, whenever this happens, the overall leverage in the market also goes up, and with leverage,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was one of the biggest gainers on Tuesday, as price rose by as much as 8% in today’s session. The surge pushed the token to its strongest level since the middle of August, and closer to a key resistance zone. Toncoin was another notable gainer, climbing by over 6% today.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was a strong gainer on Tuesday, as the token rose by as much as 8% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $0.5634 to start the week, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.6127 earlier today.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, the world’s fifth largest cryptocurrency rose to its highest level since August 15.
 
 
Today’s move saw XRP climb for a third straight day, pushing the token close to a ceiling of $0.6400.
 
From the chart, it appears that the relative strength index (RSI) has broken a resistance point of 73.00, and is now sitting at 75.08.
 
In order to reach the aforementioned resistance level, the index will likely need to reach a ceiling at or above 80.00.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was another notable gainer on Tuesday, climbing to a one-month high during the day.
 
TON/USD hit a high of $2.23 earlier in the day, which comes a day after trading at a low of $2.09.
 
Owing to the move, toncoin rose to its highest point since September 28, when price was above $2.30.
 
 
Looking at the chart, recent gains have pushed price strength above a ceiling at 59.00, and the index is now tracking at 61.62.
 
The next visible point of resistance is at the 71.00 point, and if hit, there is a good chance TON moves towards $2.60.
