        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitget has abandoned its pursuit of a Virtual Asset  
Trading Platform license in Hong Kong. This decision is attributed to factors  
related to the crypto exchange’s business and the digital asset landscape, the  
company said in its official statement today (Monday).
Bitget’s Hong Kong division, BitgetX, is set to  
cease operations by December 13, 2023. After this date, BitgetX’s website will  
be inaccessible. The company has emphasized the importance of compliance with  
this deadline. Failure to withdraw assets in time will result in the permanent  
loss of access once BitgetX is closed.
The crypto exchange has reassured its users that its  
priority is ensuring a smooth and orderly offboarding process. The customer  
support team is available to address any concerns or queries related to the  
closure and the subsequent transfer of assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin and crypto space is poised for a potentially transformative week, with several key events that could have far-reaching implications for the market. Let’s delve into the specifics of each event:
 
#1 Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval – Friday
 
As Bitcoinist reported earlier today, a critical window is currently open for the SEC to potentially approve all 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs. The deadline ends on November 17, after which newer filings will enter a public comment period. This is especially interesting because it is assumed that the SEC aims to avoid favoritism in a highly competitive market, as highlighted by industry experts. Remarkably, the SEC needs to make a decision on two spot Bitcoin ETFs by Franklin Templeton and Hashdex by November 17!
 
#2 US CPI Report – Tuesday

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a year marked by  
unprecedented growth, the cryptocurrency landscape is witnessing a substantial  
surge in the number of crypto wallet addresses holding over $1 million in  
Bitcoin. The  
data is striking, indicating a threefold increase in such millionaire  
wallets, rising from 23,795 at the beginning of the year to an impressive  
81,925 currently. This surge, amounting to a remarkable 237% increase in just  
11 months, points toward a profound shift in the crypto space.
What’s behind the BTC  
Wholecoiner movement?
It's crucial to dissect this  
surge intelligently—these millionaire wallets aren't merely a representation of  
individual users. Many of them belong to crypto exchanges and financial  
institutions, indicating a significant uptick in institutional involvement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The  
entities overseeing the bankruptcy process of crypto platform FTX have filed a  
lawsuit accusing Mirana Corp, an investment arm Bybit, of receiving a  
substantial portion of $935 million in transfers just before FTX filed for  
Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The lawsuit alleges that these transfers were "made  
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud FTX.com's present or future  
creditors."
Bybit's  
Demand for $20 Million: Adding Complexity to the Dispute
FTX's  
bankruptcy managers argued that these transfers to Mirana Corp, Time Research,  
and specific individuals should be classified as fraudulent. Such fraudulent transfers would give FTX a  
legal basis to seek the return of the full amount of these transfers, along  
with interest, for the benefit of FTX's bankruptcy estates.
