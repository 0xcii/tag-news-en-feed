The crypto founder was found guilty of all seven charges after co-mingling his clients’ funds with that of his trading arm, Alameda Research. Billions of dollars were lost, which led SBF to jail. However, only now do his victims and the public get a glimpse into his life in prison.

Altcoins May Be Overbought Currently As Trader Profits Have Shot Up
 
In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed how the altcoins as a whole have been observing high profits recently based on the MVRV ratio.

He further stated that if it is neither of those, then he is definitely using his claim about being Satoshi as a duress code. Althoug…]]></summary>
