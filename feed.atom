U.S. Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO), a former banker and a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said last week that the government should temporarily insure every bank deposit in the country.

His controversial sentiments quickly sparked a heated response on Twitter, including that from Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson.
 
Van Overtveldt’s remarks come in the wake of the recent failures of three U.S. banks – Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Silvergate Bank – calling digital assets “speculative poison.”
