        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Saturday’s biggest movers is XRP, which rose to a 30-day high earlier in today’s session. The token rose for a third consecutive day, as bulls returned to the market to start the weekend. Cardano was another notable gainer today.
 
XRP
 

 
XRP (formerly ripple), moved to a one-month high on Saturday, as bulls began to gradually renter the market.
 

 
Following a low of $0.4614 on Friday, XRP/USD raced to a peak of $0.4777 earlier in the day.
 

 
As a result of the surge, the token climbed to its highest level since April 30, when it was last above $0.4800.
 

 

 

 
Looking at the chart, the move came as XRP bulls broke out of a key resistance level at the $0.4750
 

 
This occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) also moved beyond a ceiling at the 57.00 mark.
 

 
At the time of writing this, the index is now at a reading of 58.18, with the next target for bulls potentially at 62.00.
 

 

 
Cardano (ADA)
 

 
Cardano (ADA), was also in the green to start the weekend, with prices moving further away from a recent support level.
 

 
ADA/USD hit an intraday high of $0.3667 earlier in today’s session, which comes following a low of $0.3564 on Friday.
 

 
The move has resulted in cardano climbing to its strongest point since Wednesday, moving away from the aforementioned floor at $0.3550 in the process.
 

 

 

 
From the chart, ADA has begun to consolidate, with price now retreating from its earlier highs, following a collision with a ceiling on the RSI.
 

 
Price strength has failed to move past a point of resistance of 44.00 which has pushed the token to a current reading of $0.3638.
