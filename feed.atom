        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was a notable gainer during Saturday’s session, as the meme coin climbed to a three-month high. The move comes as traders continue to react to Binance’s decision to approve the coin as a collateral asset, in addition to the upcoming launch of Shibarium. Dogecoin also snapped its recent losing streak today.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) jumped to a three-month high on Saturday, with prices surging by as much as 10%.
 
Following a low of $0.000008551 on Friday, SHIB/USD surged to a peak of $0.000009509 earlier in today’s session.
 
This resulted in the meme coin climbing to its strongest point since May 6, when price reached a high of $0.00001007.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved past a resistance level of 67.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 73.62, which is its highest level since February.
 
Should momentum continue throughout the weekend, the next target for bulls is likely to be a ceiling at $0.00001025.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
In addition to SHIB, dogecoin (DOGE) also rose higher today, snapping a three-day losing streak in the process.
 
DOGE/USD rallied to a high at $0.07628, less than 24 hours after the meme coin was at a low of $0.07279.
 
As a result of this surge in price, DOGE is now trading at its highest point since Wednesday, after breaking out of a resistance zone of $0.0760.
 
 
This coincided with the RSI moving past its own ceiling at the 52.00 mark. It is currently at a reading of 55.84.
 
Despite today’s rally, dogecoin is still trading nearly 3% lower than at the same point last weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the weekend trading below the $29,000 level, as markets continued to react to the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report. 187,000 jobs were added to the economy in July, less than the 200,000 markets had expected. Ethereum neared a multi-week low.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to below the $29,000 level on Saturday, as traders continued to digest the latest nonfarm payrolls report.
 
Following a high of $29,302.08 on Friday, BTC/USD slipped to a bottom of $28,885.34 earlier in today’s session.
 
This was the first time since Tuesday that the world’s largest cryptocurrency had fallen below $29,000.
 
 
Saturday’s decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) moved to a long-term support level at 42.00.
 
The index is currently tracking marginally below this point, as bears attempt to maintain the current downward momentum.
 
However, price has since consolidated, and as of writing is trading above today’s low, with a current price of $29,022.59.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) remained above the $1,800 level, despite bearish sentiment intensifying on Saturday.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,817.41 earlier in today’s session, following a peak of $1,847.91 the day prior.
 
The decline saw ethereum drop close to Tuesday’s low at $1,812, which was the weakest point the cryptocurrency had hit since June 21.
 
 
This latest downturn comes as price strength moved below a key support point at the 43.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.57.
