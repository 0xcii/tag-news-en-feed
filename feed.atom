        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of Twitter, has stated that he plans to make additional modifications to the website. One of the anticipated changes entails changing the company’s iconic blue bird emblem to “X.”
 
In a significant development, X.com has been redirected to Twitter.com, driven by a noteworthy tweet from Musk. According to him, a temporary “X” design will replace Twitter’s recognizable blue bird emblem, which has served as the platform’s symbol for over 10 years.
 
The billionaire enthusiastically engaged his supporters, building significant expectations for this game-changing decision.
 
Musk began tweeting about the makeover to X after midnight ET yesterday. Musk frequently uses the one-letter word X in the titles of his companies and products.
