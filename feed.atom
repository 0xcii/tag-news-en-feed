        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pepe (PEPE) coin has emerged at the forefront of the crypto market today after an impressive rally. In the last day, the meme coin’s price has risen by over 50% amid wild speculation and bullishness as the Bitcoin price touched $57,000 for the first time in more than two years.
 
Why Is PEPE Price Surging?
 
The current uptrend being recorded by PEPE is not out of the ordinary, but there is no single factor driving the price either. As crypto investors regain their bullishness, coins which have previously failed to rally seem to be taking front and center this time around, and the meme coin fits this narrative perfectly.

This price surge is likely due to several recent developments that undoubtedly provide a bullish narrative for BTC. 
 
Demand For Bitcoin Is Skyrocketing 
 
Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the new nine Spot Bitcoin ETFs (excluding Grayscale’s GBTC) set a new all-time trading volume record with $2.4 billion traded on February 26. This is significant as it shows the increased demand for the flagship crypto from institutional investors. 
 
 
Due to the interest in these Bitcoin ETFs, the fund issuers have continued to accumulate a significant amount of Bitcoin. Interestingly, as revealed by Bloomberg …]]></summary>

However, the launch ceremony wasn’t without its controversies. Several accusations arose, with some community members alleging that the Starknet team dumped a significant amount of their tokens, contributing to a price drop below $2 for STRK.
 
Additionally, reports surfaced regarding issues with the token issuance process, further stirring doubts and anxieties among investors.
