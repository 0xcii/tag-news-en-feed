This directive, which stems from a White House initiative, is part of a broader effort to understand the growing electricity demands and environmental impacts of the Bitcoin mining industry.
 
A Political Ploy Against Bitcoin
 
Morgenstern’s remarks suggest a deep-seated belief that the directive is less about environmental concern and more a politically motivated attack on the Bitcoin and crypto sector. Via X, he argues that the mandate is an indirect result of recommendations from the White …]]></summary>

Not one to mince words, Fink articulated a clear framework for his company's approach to Bitcoin, and furthermore for BlackRock's intention to replicate similar ETF products for other assets. “If we can 'ETF' a Bitcoin, imagine what we can do with all financial instruments.” Fink continued, speaking about Bitcoin itself, stating “I don’t believe it’s ever going to be a currency. I believe it’s an asset class.”
