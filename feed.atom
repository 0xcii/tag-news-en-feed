        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a win against the crypto industry, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has obtained a default judgment against Thor Technologies and its founder David Chin. 
 
According to court documents, Thor Technologies and Chin were found guilty of conducting an unregistered offering of crypto asset securities amounting to $2.6 million. 
 
SEC Prevails In Unregistered Crypto Offering Lawsuit
 
The judgment was issued by a San Francisco district court, which permanently restrains and enjoins the defendants from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. 
 
These sections pertain to the sale and offering of what the SEC denominates as “crypto securities” without proper registration or exemption.

        <updated>2023-10-20T22:09:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several reports have revealed that Binance, which is recognized as the leading crypto exchange by trading volume, intends to discontinue its Visa crypto card on December 20, 2023. The enterprise emphasized that only a “small number of Binance users” would be affected by this development.
 
Binance to Discontinue Visa Offering by Year’s End
 
In 2023, crypto debit cards have been falling out of favor rapidly, triggered in part by a series of bankruptcies that ignited a crypto bear market. Back in March, Bitpay in the U.S. phased out its prepaid Mastercard program, although it assured users of a renewed card service on the horizon. However, this week, holders of the Binance Visa card were informed via email that the card would cease to be functional by the close of the year.
 
The email communicated that the Binance Visa card would become non-operational post-December 20, 2023. The Binance Visa, which was available to users in Europe, was utilized by individuals across various countries including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, the Czech Republic, and Finland, among others. Binance has suggested that cardholders can switch to Binance Pay for their shopping needs, provided the service is accessible in their region.
 
 
The email also clarified that, despite the changes, Binance accounts would remain unaffected and continue to operate as usual. A lively discussion about the Binance Visa card issue has taken place on social media. “Binance shutting down their Visa card,” one person said. “The [Gnosis Pay] card cannot come soon enough! wen shipping?” Another user expressed indifference towards the shutdown, expressing a preference for the Crypto.com Visa card instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent turn of events, Ethereum’s co-founder, Joseph Lubin, is under legal scrutiny over alleged issues in equity promises related to his blockchain technology company, ConsenSys.
 
ConsenSys, recently appraised at roughly $7 billion, is at the center of these allegations. The company, which has been instrumental in numerous blockchain innovations, is now caught in a maelstrom of accusations, primarily revolving around equity commitments and asset transfers.
 
 
Accusations And Alleged Equity Violations
 
A group of over twenty former employees has lodged a lawsuit against Lubin, suggesting that the Ethereum co-founder orchestrated a complex asset transfer within the holding structure of ConsenSys.

It truly is a mind-blowingly large grab attempt at private information of anyone they can get their hands on. They want all regulated entities — VASPs, banks, financial institutions or entities like casinos, etc. — to by default submit reports of any transactions interacting with mixing within 30 days of noticing the relevant transaction and its association to mixing activity. Currently, most exchanges and businesses keep these records anyway, but they do not by default send copies of them to regulators unless deeper inspection actually merits a reason to do so. FinCEN wants that to change.

The dismissal agreement, reached by both parties, means that the scheduled trial for April next year will no longer proceed. However, it is important to note that while the charges against Garlinghouse and Larsen have been dropped, the SEC has not abandoned the case altogether.
 
SEC’s Bid For Ripple Appeal Paused
 
The development came to light when FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terret reported the dismissal, emphasizing that the SEC’s move did not signify the end of the case but rather the withdrawal of charges specifically against Garlinghouse and Larsen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was a big gainer on Friday, as markets reacted to the SEC’s decision to drop its lawsuit against Ripple’s management team. The commission previously alleged that CEO Brad Garlinghouse and chairman Chris Larsen had violated securities laws. Solana also surged, rising by over 10% today.
 
XRP
 
XRP rose to a two-week high on Friday, following a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to drop its case against Garlinghouse and Larsen.
 
XRP/USD peaked at $0.5291 earlier in the day, which comes following a low at $0.4831 the day prior.
 
As a result of today’s high, ripple rose to its highest point since October 5, when price peaked at $0.5325.
 
 
Earlier gains have now eased, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to move beyond a ceiling at 57.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 56.32, with the next visible floor at the 50.00 level.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average has also begun to trend upwards, increasing chances of an upwards crossover in the upcoming days.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) surged significantly higher in today’s session, after finally breaking its long-term ceiling at $25.00.
 
After trading at a bottom of $24.17 on Thursday, SOL/USD jumped to an intraday high of $27.29 earlier today.
 
Friday’s move is the highest point that solana has hit since July 20, when price peaked at $27.35.
 
 
As a result of this strong sentiment, SOL has risen into overbought territory, with the RSI climbing to a current reading of 74.60.
 
A point of resistance now awaits current bulls at the 75.00 mark, and should they prevail, solana could capture $28.00.

Without any marketing or PR, it was the community that helped transform the anonymous 9-page whitepaper from an obscure cypherpunk list into the functional Bitcoin software we use today. It was the community that propelled Bitcoin across the globe, spreading the knowledge and engaging all sorts of people and businesses that recognize the need for better money.
Bitcoin is a global phenomenon now, but its community is still the gravity center fostering technological development and adoption. It also represents something else: an elusive, yet precious quality that binds very different people from all walks of life, political preferences, age, occupation...
