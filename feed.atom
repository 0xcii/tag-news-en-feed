Following a low of $32.29 on Sunday, SOL/USD rose to an intraday high at $35.17 to start the week.
 
This is the highest level the cryptocurrency has hit since November 6 last year, when the price was trading above $37.00.
 
 
Solana was one of the biggest tokens to fall following the FTX fraud scandal, however price has made steady gains since then.
 
Today’s surge comes as the relative strength index (RSI) rallied above a ceiling at 74.00, and now sits at 77.33.
 
SOL remains above $35.00 as of writing, however, bulls could begin taking profits in the coming days.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
Avalanche (AVAX) made sizable gains to start the week, moving by as much as 6% higher during the day.
 
AVAX/USD peaked at $11.60 on Monday, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a bottom at $10.92.
 
This has resulted in avalanche rising to its strongest point since October 7, when price last surpassed a ceiling at $11.70.
 
 
Earlier gains have marginally faded, with AVAX now sitting at $11.57, and this comes as the RSI hit a ceiling at 70.00.
 
Price strength is now hovering at 69.40, however bulls will likely look to break this mark, and force a move above 70.00 in the coming days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a compelling tale of persistence and financial prudence, a Reddit user embarked on a unique investment experiment, demonstrating the potential rewards of consistently investing small amounts, or dollar cost averaging, into Bitcoin. 
The Redditor, going by the handle u/Gorillahair2000, initiated an experiment to determine whether allocating just $5 per day into Bitcoin was a worthwhile endeavor, and over the course of one full year, diligently recorded their progress.
After 365 days of investing $5 per day, the Redditor accumulated a total stack of 0.075 Bitcoin. The average purchase price stood at $24,108.58, while the current price of Bitcoin was $34,158.20. 
The total expenditure over the year amounted to $1,825.00, and the current value of the investment was $2,585.75, yielding a net change of +41.68%.
The Redditor also noted that they accounted for the 0.5-1.0% spread on each of their purchases, meaning the gains remained after adjusting for fees. The user indicated that they buy with Strike, a popular Bitcoin Lightning wallet, and then withdraw the Bitcoin to a hardware wallet, in line with industry best practices.
In a year's time, they transformed the daily expense equivalent to a Starbucks coffee into $2,500 in current value, or a $750 gain.
The experiment proves that even with a modest budget, investing in Bitcoin can yield significant returns, and it further demonstrates the power of dollar-cost averaging, a strategy that involves consistently purchasing assets at fixed intervals, regardless of their price, thereby mitigating the effects of market volatility.
Further, it also highlights Bitcoin's main advantages as a sound money, one that doesn't depreciate like traditional savings vehicles tied to inflationary fiat currencies.]]></summary>

Before the creation of the Internet, the way most people connected was through their community. Places such as moose lodges, rotary clubs, union halls, car clubs, Boy Scouts, and Girl Scouts were the primary ways people in the same community could get together and organize around a shared sense of principles and purpose.
Those days seem quaint and from our very distant past. Meeting people this way was the norm until the early 1990s, which is not long ago when you think about it. With the creation of the Internet, people have relied less and less on in-person social networking and opted to start networking on the Internet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a strategic move that solidifies its presence in the cryptocurrency sector, Thailand's Kasikorn Bank has announced the acquisition of a 97% stake in Satang Corporation Company Limited, the parent company of the Satang cryptocurrency exchange.
The deal, valued at 3.705 billion Thai baht ($102.8 million), was conducted through a newly formed Kasikorn Bank subsidiary called Unita Capital, specifically created for investments in digital asset companies, according to local news sources.
Kasikorn is the country's second-largest bank by assets under management, according to 2023 data from Statista.
Following the finalization of the acquisition, Satang Corporation will be rebranded as Orbix Trade Company Limited. 
In addition to the exchange services, the newly formed company will establish three additional subsidiaries: Orbix Custodian, Orbix Invest (a digital asset fund manager), and Orbix Technology, a blockchain technology developer.
Kasikorn's support for Bitcoin specifically, as opposed to other cryptocurrencies and digital tokens, is at this time unclear.
This announcement follows K-Bank's recent launch of a $100 million fund designed to target investments in web3, fintech, and artificial intelligence. Its counterpart, Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), is also reportedly making notable strides into web3 and the cryptocurrency space. Both banks are vying to offer a full spectrum of crypto services permissible within the regulatory framework in Thailand.
SCB had earlier this year attempted a similar acquisition of a regional rival, though it was notably stalled over regulatory issues.
Kasikorn Bank has set an ambitious goal to capture 20% of the cryptocurrency market share in Thailand by the year 2024, marking its commitment notable at a time when many global banks remain on the sector's sidelines.]]></summary>
