        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Justice caught up with crypto scam architect Marco Ruiz Ocho on Friday, as he received a five-year prison sentence for his role in orchestrating the IcomTech Ponzi scheme.
 
The ruling marks a significant victory for investors swindled out of millions and serves as a stark warning to bad actors in the burgeoning, and often unregulated, world of crypto.
