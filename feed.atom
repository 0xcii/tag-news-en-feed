        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Collapsed crypto exchange FTX is now going after executives of its European subsidiary in a bid to recover $323 million. In a lawsuit filed in a US bankruptcy court in Delaware, the exchange claims it overpaid to acquire its European branch while accusing Sam Bankman-Fried and other company Insiders of mismanaging funds from creditors and customers. 
 
The lawyers representing FTX Trading Ltd and Maclaurin Investments Ltd accused Sam Bankman-Fried and his associates of buying Digital Assets AG (DAAG) – a Swiss company that later became FTX’s European branch, for $323 million between 2020 and 2021 despite knowing that DAAG had limited business and no intellectual property beyond a “business plan.”

While these gains vastly beat the S&P 500, which has rebounded close to its former all-time highs, they pale in comparison to the copy traders at PrimeXBT.
 
At the moment, every trader in the copy trading leaderboard top ten has over 500% ROI, with the number one trader’s performance nearing 5x that. By the time you’re done reading, it will become blatantly obvious how PrimeXBT copy traders can outperform the crypto market.
 
Updated benchmarking with Bitcoin and the S&P 500
 
In June 2023, Bitcoin closed 11% higher above the psychological barrier of $30,000. At the same time, the S&P 500 ended June, adding 6% to a sustained rally that began in October. Consequently, this …]]></summary>

Securities Commission (CNV), has approved the first Bitcoin-based futures  
contract, which gives investors exposure to the top cryptocurrency. It marks  
the first time the regulator is approving such a product in the  
country.
The futures contract is  
based on the Bitcoin index listed by the Argentinian securities exchange, Matba  
Rofex. Following the listing, Matba Rofex released the guidelines on how the  
futures contract will be traded in a statement yesterday (Thursday).
"The measure, which  
was adopted through a resolution, intends to facilitate adaptation to the  
regulatory challenges imposed by new technologies in the provision of financial  
products," the CNV said in a statement translated from Spanish.

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was on the cusp of hitting $32,000 in the past 24 hours, following the news that XRP was not necessarily classified as a security by a U.S. judge.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $31,814.51 late on Thursday, after trading at a low of $30,486.69 earlier in the day.
 
Yesterday’s peak is the strongest point bitcoin has hit since late-May last year, which is the last time price was over $32,000.

Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have emerged as a key breakthrough in the financial  
environment, having the potential to transform our perception of and  
interaction with money. CBDCs are central bank-issued and controlled digital  
representations of a country's fiat currency. 
They have the  
ability to reform payments, increase financial inclusion, and change monetary  
policy. In this article, we will look at the rise of CBDCs and its potential  
consequences for the global financial system.

A few weeks ago, BlackRock and other major financial firms filed for permission to offer spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 
Though the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission(SEC) stated that these initial filings were inadequate, forcing the firms to refile, many investors believe that they will eventually be approved, creating the first-such products on the market. These new financial instruments would allow institutional and retail investors to access exposure to bitcoin's price without having to purchase actual bitcoin.

Following this, he was released on bail by a US District Judge on a bond of $40 million.
 
According to a court document filed on Thursday, the personal recognizance bond for Alex Mashinsky is secured by his Manhattan residence, as well as the signatures of his wife and another individual.
 
Benjamin Alee and Jonathan Ohring are the attorneys representing Alex Mashinsky, and in a statement, Ohring mentioned that Mashinsky is eager to defend himself in court against what he believes are unfounded charges.
