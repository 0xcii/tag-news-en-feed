Zhou Weidi, deputy director of the Institute of Economics and Business Administration Central China Pedagogical University, has weighed in on the possible implementation of a BRICS currency in fighting unilateral sanctions and the hegemony of the U.S. dollar in international markets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange owned by the Winklevoss twins, has secured its position in the Canadian market by filing for pre-registration with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), a state regulator in the country. Once approved, Gemini will become a restricted dealer with the OSC.  

Gemini Secures Its  Presence in Canada
The registration came as the OSC mandated the registration of all crypto exchanges operating within its jurisdiction. Existing crypto exchanges must pre-register with the regulator while preparing to gain full registration.

This integration will allow Twitter users to view market charts through the social media app, via an already-existing connection with the TradingView API, and then to click through to eToro, where stocks and cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold.
 To anyone who follows the overlapping Twitter communities known as fintwit and CT (meaning financial Twitter and crypto Twitter, respectively), the eToro integration will make perfect sense. Twitter has become an arena in which finance and crypto information is circulated first and fastest, and where market sentiment can be both gauged and, in the case of some large accounts, influenced.

The US authority brought forth a Massachusetts District Court opinion in the case against Commonwealth Equity Services LLC, dated April 07, 2023. According to the SEC, the decision confirms that the Howey test does not require a separate fair notice to Ripple.
 
The judge in SEC vs. Commonwealth acknowledged that a 50-year-old Supreme Court precedent regarding disclosure requirements is sufficient to justify fair notice (in this case).
