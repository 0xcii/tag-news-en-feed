His comments have generated a lot of reactions, from some ridiculing at how outrageous such a dream can get to others questioning the timing when Bitcoin just fell to about $55,602.
 
Pippen’s revelation follows his past correspondence with the crypto community, which included dropping an NFT collection in 2022 and indicating interest in Ethereum and Solana. Though fans on social media have poked fun of the assertion and how horrible a timing it is, his most recent endeavor seems to be an intriguing one.
