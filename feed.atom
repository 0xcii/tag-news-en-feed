Since September 1, 2020, a whopping 804,000 bitcoin, equivalent to $20.79 billion, has been pulled from centralized exchanges. Notably, 184,000 BTC of that sum, valued at $4.75 billion, was withdrawn in just the last three months.

Centralized exchanges are holding significantly fewer bitcoins (BTC) than they did three years ago. Cryptoquant.com data reveals that on September 1, 2020, trading platforms had a reserve of 2.828 million BTC. Fast forward roughly three years, and that number has dwindled to 2.024 million, marking a decrease of 804,000 BTC.

The aforementioned papers suggest that the majority of these transactions primarily favored individuals who hold influential positions inside the business.
 
However, it’s essential to note that FTX debtors have stated that the accuracy and completeness of this data cannot be guaranteed, and they disclaim any liability for potential errors or omissions.
 
Sam Trabucco, the former co-CEO of Alameda Research, benefited from a $2.51 million transfer from the company to the American Yacht Group in March last year.

Even though prices of top crypto assets, including Bitcoin, are way above 2018 lows at spot rates, market participants appear apprehensive as interest fizzles. 
 
Interest In Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Cryptocurrency Falling
 
Typically, crypto users closely monitor sentiment indicators, including Google Trends data, to gauge overall interest. Analyzing search data can provide valuable insights into how the broader audience perceives and interacts with digital assets. Rapid changes in search trends, as is currently the case, can signal changes in sentiment, which often directly impact supply and demand market forces.

According to his forward-looking perspective, this transformative shift is expected to materialize over the course of the next six years.
 
Zhao pointed out a recent rise in institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, seeing it as a validation of the industry and its technology. He believes that if even a small portion of the trillions of dollars controlled by institutional investors in the equity market were invested in crypto assets, it would significantly boost the cryptocurrency market’s growth.

The latest powerplay? A Hail Mary interlocutory appeal from the authority. The agency tried appealing a past court decision allowing Ripple to use a “fair notice” defense. However, prominent lawyers vehemently oppose this, predicting its inevitable rejection.
 
Ripple’s chief counsel, James K. Filan, and Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal already called the SEC’s bluff. In their view, the rigid standards for an interlocutory appeal still need to be met. These mid-case appeals only proceed if waiting for a final verdict would cause “irreparable harm.” According to Filan, the agency has yet to prove this harm exists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin was easily one of the biggest movers in crypto markets to start the weekend, as price rose by over 10%. Saturday’s surge comes despite the global market cap mostly trending lower, having fallen by 0.43% as of writing. XRP was one of the tokens to fall, dropping below a key price floor.
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was a notable mover in today’s session, as the token rose by as much as 10% on Saturday.
 
After a low of $1.74 on Friday, TON/USD surged to an intraday peak of $1.95 to start the weekend.
 
As a result of the move, toncoin climbed to its strongest point since May 24, which was the last time price traded above $2.00.
 
 
Today’s rally comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rebounded at a floor of 75.00, following a surge above 83.00.
 
Price strength is deeply overbought, however this has not stopped bulls from continuing to send TON even higher.
 
This could be a recipe for a bear trap however, with a change in direction almost certainly on the cards in the not too distant future.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was in the red to start the weekend, as the token marginally dropped below a key support point.
 
XRP/USD fell to a bottom at $0.4886 on Saturday, which comes following a peak at $0.5081 the day prior.
 
This downturn comes as bears pushed price below a price floor of $0.5100 earlier in the week, with momentum continuing to slip since then.
 
 
Ever since the ripple ruling, which saw XRP price spike to an almost two-year high, the token has mostly moved lower.
 
The RSI is now tracking around a floor of 29.00, which is in the midst of a bear zone. However, should this level hold firm, there could be a reversal next week.
