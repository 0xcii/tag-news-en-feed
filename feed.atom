        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a crypto analyst known pseudonymously as Master Kenobi on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the prime cryptocurrency that’s going to outperform Bitcoin in this market cycle is none other than Dogecoin, the original OG meme coin. The analyst suggested that Dogecoin will outperform Bitcoin in the ongoing market cycle due to the follower effect, with Bitcoin laying the groundwork for the meme coin. 
 
This comes even as Bitcoin has had the lion’s share of investments and new inflow into the crypto industry since the beginning of the year due to increased institutional investments. This has seen Bitcoin outperforming most altcoins, with Ethereum, the king of altcoins, especially struggling to keep up.
