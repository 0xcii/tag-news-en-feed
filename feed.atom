        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Willy Woo, a respected Bitcoin on-chain analyst, is bullish on the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency. Taking to X on March 4, the analyst said BTC can soar to as high as $125,000 by the end of 2025.
 
Institutions Are Here, Bitcoin To $125,000 By End Of 2025 
This optimistic outlook hinges on increased institutional adoption, particularly from investment giants Blackrock and Fidelity. Notably, Woo suggests that even a minimal 3% allocation to Bitcoin by clients of these firms could push the price past $125,000. 
 
 
For context, the analyst highlights Blackrock’s $9.1 trillion assets under management (AUM) and Fidelity’s $4.2 trillion AUM. These figures are used with Blackrock and Fidelity’s most optimistic portfolio allocation recommendations of around 84.9% for Blackrock and 3% for Fi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MicroStrategy Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR) has announced its plans to offer $600 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2030 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers. The offering is subject to market conditions and other factors, with the potential to increase by an additional $90 million.

These unsecured, senior obligations of MicroStrategy will bear interest payable semi-annually and mature on March 15, 2030. The company intends to grant initial purchasers an option to purchase additional notes within a 13-day period.
MicroStrategy plans to use the net proceeds from the offering to "acquire additional bitcoin and for general corporate purposes." The offering will be made to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933.
As the self described "world's first Bitcoin development company", MicroStrategy is dedicated to supporting the growth and development of the Bitcoin network. The company uses its cashflows and proceeds from equity and debt financings to accumulate bitcoin, which serves as its primary treasury reserve asset.
The offering will help bolster MicroStrategy's position in the Bitcoin market and further its mission of advancing Bitcoin adoption and innovation. However, the offering is subject to uncertainties related to market conditions and completion terms, as outlined in MicroStrategy's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
MicroStrategy's stock has outperformed Bitcoin year to date in 2024, rising 94.70% at the time of writing, compared to a 58.22% rise for BTC.]]></summary>

Interestingly, the crypto token could already be set for a parabolic move, considering it has already broken this trendline. 
 
XRP Price Breaks Out From Six-Year Trendline
 
Jaydee confirmed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that XRP finally broke out from the six-year trendline he had alluded to earlier. In his earlier X post, he mentioned that a breakout from that trendline would be “massive” for XRP’s price. From the accompanying chart he shared, he hinted at XRP rising to as high as $3 when this breakout occurs (which it already did).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has again experienced technical difficulties, with its platform crashing amid heightened market activity and bullish sentiment. 
 
Coinbase Assures Users Of Fund Safety
 
This incident follows a similar crash just five days ago reported by Bitcoinist, which caused Coinbase’s stock to plummet and frustrated users with zero balances on their accounts. 
 
Reports on social media platforms, such as X (formerly Twitter), highlighted the issue, prompting Coinbase’s support account to acknowledge the problem and assure users that their assets were safe. 
 
 
The exchange’s support account has issued another statement regarding the current outage, stating that funds remain secure and trading is unaffected. The statement reads:
 

We are aware some users may experience increased latency across http://Coinbase.com and a few users may see intermittent zero balance. Rest assured, your funds are safe. Our team is investigating this issue and will provide an update. Trading is not impacted at this time.
 
Intermittent Technical Issues
 
The recent surge in market activity and prevailing bullish sentiment has significantly strained Coinbase’s infrastructure, resulting in intermittent technical issues. 
 
 
Traders and investors flocking to the platform to take advantage of the market’s positive momentum may have overwhelmed the exchange’s servers, causing some users to experience latency and intermittent zero balance issues.
 
 
However, nothing is certain as there has been no further official statement from the exchange’s support account or Coinbase executives as of this writing.
 
 
Currently, the exchange stock, listed under the ticker name COIN, is trading at $226. This marks a significant increase of over 10% in the past 24 hours. The surge in price comes as Bitcoin spot ETFs gain traction in the market and Bitcoin itself moves closer to its previous all-time high of $69,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto analyst Bluntz Capital has once again shared a bullish narrative for Solana-based meme coin Dogwifhat (WIF). This follows the crypto token’s recent price surge that saw it rise to as high as $1.70 on March 3. 
 
WIF To Flip At Least Two Meme Coins
 
Bluntz mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that WIF will flip at least two meme coins, currently ahead of it in market cap. WIF is the fifth largest meme coin by market cap, only behind Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK). 
 
 
In a subsequent post, the analyst hinted at WIF flipping all three except DOGE. He also replied in the negative when one of his followers asked if WIF was going to overtake the foremost meme coin, DOGE. As such, Bluntz seemed to predict that WIF would rise to the second spot at mo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)  
has flagged BitForex, a cryptocurrency exchange, for suspected fraud. The  
exchange abruptly went offline on Feb. 23, with a reported $57 million missing  
from its hot wallets.
BitForex's sudden disappearance prompted Hong Kong's  
regulator to add the company to its alert list regarding potential fraud  
associated with the exchange. The SFC announced its concerns, citing the  
exchange's lack of licensing or registration for operating a Virtual Asset  
Trading Platform in Hong Kong.
Suspected Fraud and Regulatory Response
The SFC mentioned: "Alert List is a list of
