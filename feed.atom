After the Hinman documents in the legal dispute between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were released a few hours ago, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the inflation rates for the month of May in the United States of America at 8:30 am EST.
 
The data was expected with high expectations as it could signal a rapid drop in inflation on the one hand, while on the other hand it is likely to be an important basis for tomorrow’s interest rate decision by the US Federal Reserve (Fed).
 
For the first time since March 2022, when the Fed began its rate hike cycle, the US central bank could announce a rate pause. Experts expect that risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto could benefit greatly.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-above-26000-ahead-of-us-inflation-report/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-13T12:33:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose above the $26,000 level on Tuesday, as markets prepared for the latest U.S. inflation figures. Consumer prices for May are expected to fall to 4.1% — double the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Ethereum remained below $1,800.
 
Bitcoin
 
Ahead of the upcoming inflation report in the United States, bitcoin (BTC) moved back above the $26,000 level.
 
Following a low of $25,686.04 to start the week, BTC/USD raced to a peak of $26,261.14 earlier today.
 
The move saw bitcoin near a recent resistance level at $26,300, which is one of the last hurdles stopping bulls from moving towards $27,000.
 
 
In order to get towards this level, a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI) will also need to be broken.
 
This is the 47.00 level on the indicator, and as of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 44.02.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average will need to also shift course, and divert away from its current downward path.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) moved marginally higher, however it continued to trade below $1,800.
 
ETH/USD jumped to a high of $1,757.89 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after the price was at a bottom of $1,723.09.
 
The latest surge came as bulls took charge at a floor of $1,730, with the RSI bouncing from a floor of its own at 38.00.
 
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 39.33, with the next visible point of resistance being 43.00.
 
Should the index move beyond the aforementioned ceiling, there is a strong possibility that ETH will climb to $1,800.
