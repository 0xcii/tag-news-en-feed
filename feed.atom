Liberland was founded in 2015 by Czech politician V√≠t Jedliƒçka on a seven-square-kilometer stretch of disputed land. The goal of this new sovereign entity is to become a libertarian society where personal and economic freedoms thrive, with minimal government intervention. Although Liberland is not officially recognized by the United Nations, this is still a groundbreaking move as Sun‚Äôs appointment is seen as a huge step in the small nation‚Äôs global profile.
