Bitcoin Could Hit New ATH If Trump Wins
 
According to the Bernstein report, Bitcoin is a “Trump trade” as a win for the former US President could propel the leading digital currency to a new all-time high (ATH). Specifically, BTC could go as high as $90,000 in Q4 2024, following a win for the Republican candidate. 
 
 
Conversely, a win for the current Vice President and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris could force BTC to break its current bottom at $50,000 and see the orange coin decline in price to test the $30,000 to $40,000 range.

The “Mining Hashrate” refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that the miners as a whole have connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. The miners need this computing power because the BTC network uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) based consensus mechanism, where validators compete against each other to solve mathematical problems to add the next block to the chain.
 
 
As such, the Hashrate can reflect how the miners are looking at the cryptocurrency. A rise in the metric could suggest these validators are finding the asset attractive right now, so new miners are coming and/…]]></summary>
