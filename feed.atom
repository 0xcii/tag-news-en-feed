Jack Mallers Makes Striking Statement About BTC
 
Jack Mallers is the CEO of Chicago-based BTC payment provider Strike and played a crucial role in bringing Bitcoin broadly to El Salvador. In a new Twitter thread, he compares the top cryptocurrency to a central bank — more specifically, the “central banking system of the internet.”

XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) are no doubt some of the top picks for investors even now, but which of these coins are the best going into the bull market?
 
XRP (XRP)
 
One thing about XRP is that the coin was unable to enjoy the last bull market like the rest of the cryptocurrencies in the space. This is due to the fact that the Exchange and Securities Commission still has an active case against Ripple.
 
When the lawsuit was first revealed in 2020, the price of XRP lost over 40% of its value and has been unable to recover since then. It is the only cryptocurrency out of the large caps that was unable to hit a new al…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developer with the most changes to Bitcoin’s code has announced his decision to step down from the Core maintainer role.
Bitcoin Core maintainer Marco Falke has announced he will step down from the role.
 
         
         
         
        The tweet posted by Falke. 
    
The prolific Bitcoin developer took to Twitter on Tuesday, saying that, “In a challenging decision, I concluded to transition out of my role as maintainer. I remain passionate about open source and Bitcoin and I am positive about the future, however being a maintainer is no longer a good fit for me personally.”
Falke also took the time to thank his sponsors. His latest funding support came from a joint grant by Okcoin and Paradigm. 
Falke was an incredibly active participant in the Bitcoin development process, notably having merged more changes into the Bitcoin Core code than any other person. Bitcoin Magazine previously covered the daily work of Falke as a Bitcoin Core repository maintainer, including his rise to become the most prolific Core Developer in terms of the sheer number of individual changes submitted to the project. 
Falke's contributions around testing infrastructure have been the most substantive, which he identified early on as an inefficiency in the project that he was passionate about improving, as testing is critical for ensuring continuity across the network and improving quality assurance.
With Falke’s departure, there will now be only four official Bitcoin Core maintainers. While these roles are incredibly important, it is also important to note that they do not officially control Bitcoin — Bitcoin users running full nodes must opt-in to the code changes that Bitcoin Core maintainers approve, adding a layer of checks and balances to the protocol.]]></summary>
