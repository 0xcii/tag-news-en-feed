        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Nigerian crypto trading platform, Patricia, announced on Aug. 18 that it had converted users’ outstanding funds to its U.S.-backed stablecoin known as “Patricia Token.” Some social media users have slammed the crypto trading platform’s unilateral decision to convert customer funds. Some critics have characterized the conversion of user funds as the Patrica team’s attempt to exit scam users. 
 
$2 Million Reportedly Lost in Hacking Incident
 
The Nigerian gift card and crypto trading platform, Patricia, recently converted user funds to a stablecoin known as patricia token (PTK).
