        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, is set to step down from his role from the company as he plead guilty to money laundering violations, according to the Wall Street Journal. Binance, as a company, will also plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion fine.
This news arrives in the wake of the conclusion of a criminal investigation around the cryptocurrency exchange. The investigation centered on alleged regulatory breaches and illicit activities within Binance. And now, the finale of this probe seems to have prompted a leadership transition.
The investigation's official outcome is happening today, as earlier this morning Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is announcing Binances' settlement later in the afternoon. This came right after the DOJ announced major cryptocurrency enforcement actions will be taken today as well.
CZ has been a massive figure in the cryptocurrency world, steering Binance's meteoric rise to become the globe's largest crypto exchange platform by trading volume. His departure from the helm of Binance could mark a significant shift in the industry.
Amidst this wave of news, Binance has not yet officially confirmed CZ's departure plans, and CZ himself has so far refrained from commenting publicly on the matter.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US SEC, in its lawsuit against Kraken, has deliberately excluded XRP from the list of cryptocurrencies it has classified as securities. The action has sparked speculation in the crypto community about a potential victory for XRP given the regulator’s decision to not categorize XRP as a security in its filing. 
 
XRP Omitted From SEC Securities List
 
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made alarming allegations against crypto exchange Kraken. In its filing, the regulatory agency accused Kraken of unlawfully trading several cryptocurrencies in its exchange.

Bitcoin 7-Day MA Puell Multiple Has Surged Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Puell Multiple is currently at the second highest level for the year. The “Puell Multiple” is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the daily Bitcoin miner revenue and the 365-day moving average (MA) of the same.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the miners are currently earning more than the average for the past year. On the other hand, the indicator being below the mark suggests these chain validators are making less than usual right now.

He ran on a platform promising substantial reforms: cutting spending, reducing government intervention, addressing inflation, and eliminating the central bank.
Milei's path to victory was unexpected. In the general elections, he secured second place with 30% of the vote, trailing Sergio Massa of the Peronist establishment, who garnered 37%. Patricia Bullrich, former Minister of Security under President Macri's administration, obtained 24%. These results forced Balotaje, or a run-off election between Massa and Milei.

His views challenge the widely held belief that BTC, as a ‘risk-on’ asset, would suffer in economic downturns, offering a nuanced understanding of its relationship with market liquidity and economic cycles.
 
Why Bitcoin May Rise During A Prolonged Recession
 
Clemente’s argument hinges on the understanding of BTC as a hedge against monetary debasement rather than a conventional asset tied to economic performance. He explained, “Bitcoin is a hedge against monetary debasement. It goes down when liquidity declines and goes up when liquidity rises.”
