        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uniswap was in the green to start the weekend, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly consolidating. The token rebounded from losses suffered on Friday, moving closer to a key resistance level in the process. Dogecoin, on the other hand, fell lower on Saturday as traders attempted to find a stable point of support.
 
Uniswap (UNI)
 
Uniswap (UNI) was one of Saturday’s notable movers, as prices rebounded from declines suffered the day prior.
 
After sinking to a bottom of $6.10 on Friday, UNI/USD marginally rebounded, climbing to a high of $6.27 in the process.
 
As a result of this, the token moved closer to a key resistance level of $6.35, which was last hit December 5.
 
 
In order to recapture this point, UNI bulls will first need to rise beyond a ceiling of 56.70 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Currently, the index is tracking at a level of 54.75, which has contributed to the current market volatility, with traders unsure if they should maintain previous positions.
 
However, should we see price strength surge beyond the aforementioned resistance at 56.70, then it is possible that UNI bulls could send prices towards the $7.00 mark.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) on the other hand remained in the red, following a failed breakout of a key resistance point on Friday.
 
Following a move to a high of $0.09858 yesterday, DOGE/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.096 on Saturday.
 
The move comes as the meme coin was unable to surge past its ceiling of $0.0990 during Friday’s session.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this point of resistance coincides with another ceiling — that of the RSI.
 
As of writing, the index is currently tracking at 51.96, which is marginally below a ceiling of 53.00.
 
Should we see this wall broken, it is likely that the meme coin could head back towards the $0.1000 region.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-eth-consolidate-to-start-the-weekend/"/>
        <updated>2022-12-10T14:03:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the weekend trading above $17,000, as traders prepare for next week’s U.S. Federal Reserve interest decision. Markets now expect that the Fed could continue hiking rates, following a higher than expected increase in producer prices. Ethereum mainly consolidated on Saturday, as prices moved back towards a key price floor. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) remained above the $17,000 level to start the weekend, despite crypto markets mostly consolidating.
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $17,100.84 during Saturday’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $17,280.55.
 
As a result of today’s decline, BTC continued to move below its recent resistance level of $17,200.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it now appears as if bitcoin could be moving towards a floor of $16,750, which comes as market volatility remains high today.
 
The turbulence came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to move between a floor of 50.00 and a ceiling of 52.00.
 
In order for bulls to fully regain market sentiment, a breakout of the 52.00 mark must occur, which could then lead to the return of upwards momentum.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Like bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also consolidated to start the weekend, with price moving close to a key point of support.
 
Following a peak of $1,290.06 on Friday, ETH/USD moved to a bottom of $1,260.82 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s drop, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moved closer to a recent floor of $1,230.
 
 
From the chart, it seems that today’s consolidation comes as bulls failed to break out of a resistance point at $1,300.
 
As of writing, ethereum now seems as though it is heading for its aforementioned floor at the $1,230 point.
 
This comes as the 10-day (red) moving average now appears to have halted recent gains, and is slowly shifting downwards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Friday operational update halted trading of the embattled bitcoin miner in the United Kingdom and United States.

On Friday, the trading of shares of Argo Blockchain (NASDAQ: ARBK) was suspended in both the U.S. and U.K.
Particular reasoning for the suspension was not provided.
The suspension could indicate pending updates or changes to the firm.

In the released November operational update, the firm states, “The Company is endeavoring to complete such financing transactions to provide the Company with working capital sufficient for its present requirements.”
The firm is down -94.58% YTD according to NASDAQ, and it mined 198 bitcoin in the month of November. As of November 30, Argo holds 126 bitcoin, “of which 116 were BTC Equivalents.”
Previously, Bitcoin Magazine PRO analysts Dylan LeClair and Sam Rule highlighted Argo as one of several struggling public miners. They noted that a $27 million October fundraise attempt did not go through, which would have been in addition to a preceding $70.6 million loan from NYDIG. Prior to October’s failed raise, in August, Argo used some of its BTC holdings to pay back bitcoin-backed loan obligations from Galaxy Digital.]]></summary>
