        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Samson Mow, a well-known Bitcoin maximalist and CEO of Jan3, recently took to X to share his extreme-bullish stance on BTC’s future.
 
With the crypto industry awaiting the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision on a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), Mow’s post on X has stirred significant discussion.
 
Mow’s assertion that Bitcoin could unexpectedly surge to $1 million has intrigued and surprised many. His post, suggesting this monumental rise could occur “basically at any time,” aligns with the pending approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the US SEC.
 
The post was mainly part of a broader series of posts where Mow elaborated on the potential repercussions of such an unprecedented price hike for Bitcoin.

CFPB Faces Criticism from Blockchain Association Over New Proposal
 
In November 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed a new rule aimed at bringing non-bank payment providers and certain crypto transactions under its oversight. The proposal was ostensibly seen as a step towards modernizing financial regulation, and has sparked backlash in the crypto community.
 
The proposed rule by the CFPB seeks to define a market for general-use digital consumer payment applications. This would bring apps like Venmo and other digital a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From an economic standpoint, Jevon’s Paradox is arguably the foundation of the scaling road we have started walking down for Bitcoin. Pushing things off-chain is attempting to make the use of the scarce resource that blockspace is much more efficient to accommodate a materially larger user base than the blockchain can facilitate on its own. Jevon’s Paradox states that in the presence of elastic demand for something, when the efficiency of using that thing increases, i.e. the cost per use decreases, the aggregate demand for that thing among participants will increase. 
The typical example given is the fuel efficiency of cars. If cars suddenly become twice as efficient at using gasoline, people will travel more as the cost of travel has been cut in half. With people traveling more often beca…]]></summary>

Despite initial concerns about potential delays, as reported by Bitcoinist, reassurances were offered by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart and Davis Polk’s Scott Johnsson, which have alleviated such fears. Seyffart predicted that the amendments will drop today. “I don’t think this is necessarily a delay signal. Really this just shows how quickly the SEC is turning these things around,” he remarked.
