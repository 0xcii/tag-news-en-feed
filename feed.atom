        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin breached the $47K threshold on Monday, fueled by growing excitement over the potential launch of a U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The leading crypto asset kicked off the day at $43,247 per unit, then climbed to a peak of $47,281 by 2:10 p.m. Eastern Time (ET).
 
Bitcoin Rally Tops $47K
 
Monday afternoon witnessed a notable surge in the market cap’s leading crypto asset, occurring around 2 p.m. ET. Bitcoin (BTC) experienced an increase exceeding $3,600 from its daily low, with many analysts linking this upswing to the potential approval of several spot bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The latest market figures indicate that bitcoin’s previous encounter with this price bracket was in December 2021, following its descent from the record high of $69K.

The market valuation of the digital currency soared, reaching precisely $917 billion, eclipsing Meta (formerly Facebook) in market size and securing its position as the ninth-largest asset by market valuation. The trading volume for BTC has intensified, contributing $37.17 billion to the day’s total $144 billion in trades. Current statistics reveal that, at 3:10 p.m. ET, BTC’s market value of $46,922 is just over 32% below its all-time high of $69K, achieved on Nov. 10, 2021.
 
 
This uptick in price has resulted in the elimination of numerous short trading positions. Coinglass’s four-hour data indicates that $73.62 million in BTC shorts were liquidated, with approximately $13.75 million occurring following the surge past $47K. This increase in bitcoin’s price has also buoyed other cryptocurrencies, elevating the entire crypto market economy to a value of $1.80 trillion. Bitcoin dominates this figure with a 50.8% market share, while ethereum (ETH) holds a 15.6% stake in the combined market.

approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product by the Securities and  
Exchange Commission (SEC), Chair Gary Gensler's recent cautionary statements  
have cast a spotlight on the inherent risks within the crypto landscape. 
Gensler's thread on social media, although not  
explicitly addressing the pending spot Bitcoin ETF decision, underscores the  
significant concerns around crypto investments, emphasizing their volatility  
and susceptibility to fraudulent schemes.
Gensler has warned against the risks inherent in  
cryptocurrency investments. His social media thread, albeit not explicitly tied  
to the awaited ETF approval, sheds light on the broader concerns surrounding  
crypto investments.

2⃣ Investments in crypto assets also can be exceptionally risky & are often volatile. A number of major platforms & crypto assets have become insolvent and/or lost value. Investments in crypto assets continue to be subject to significant risk.
— Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) January 8, 2024
Highlighting Risks and Volatility
Gensler's cautionary tone concerns asset managers  
potentially bypassing federal securities laws with their crypto investment  
offerings. The SEC Chair's commentary alludes to the possibility that certain  
investment assets may not align with established regulatory frameworks,  
prompting a call for investors' vigilance and due diligence.
Gensler's remarks revolve around crypto investments'  
inherent volatility and vulnerability. His comments highlight the sector's  
susceptibility to market fluctuations and emphasize the need for investors to  
exercise caution, particularly given the prevalence of fraudulent activities in  
the crypto space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) could potentially commence live trading as early as Thursday or Friday, with approval happening this Wednesday, sources close to the matter told CNBC. 



This news comes amid intense anticipation for the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, a significant milestone anticipated to provide mainstream investors with a regulated avenue to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin.
"Two sources close to the process now telling me it's looking like Wednesday, which is also the deadline for Cathie Wood's ARK and 21Shares bid," said CNBC anchor Kate Rooney. "Then I'm told trading would happen Thursday or Friday, but it has been a moving target here on dates."
The imminent possibility of live trading for these ETFs signals a significant leap forward in the integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial markets. CNBC's report adds to the growing speculation surrounding the imminent introduction of these ETFs, which have been eagerly awaited by both institutional and retail investors.
Should the live trading commence as projected, it would mark a historic moment for the Bitcoin industry, reflecting a seismic shift in the perception and adoption of BTC among traditional investors.
While the specific details and exact launch time remain speculative, the potential realization of Spot Bitcoin ETFs trading live signifies a culmination of rigorous regulatory evaluations and market readiness, bringing Bitcoin one step closer to wider acceptance and legitimacy within the financial landscape.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bold statement has emerged from a former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Jay Clayton, suggesting that the approval of a Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is inevitable, stating that "there's nothing left to decide," in an interview with CNBC today.



The former SEC Chair's confident proclamation hints at an imminent breakthrough in the regulatory landscape for Bitcoin-related financial products. This assertion aligns with the growing sentiment within the Bitcoin community, eagerly anticipating the approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF.
"I think approval is inevitable, there's nothing left to decide," Clayton said. "Is the Bitcoin underlying trading market something that is robust enough, efficacious enough, where you can rely on it? It is much better today than it was five years ago."
These statements imply that key concerns or considerations previously hindering the approval process have been sufficiently addressed, paving the way for an inevitable green light from the SEC.
This bold declaration underscores the evolving sentiment within regulatory circles, reflecting a growing acceptance and understanding of Bitcoin. The potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is anticipated to mark a watershed moment in the financial sphere, enabling broader access for traditional investors seeking exposure to BTC through regulated investment vehicles.
"The last thing, and I think this is missed, is the technology to actually provide the product," the former SEC Chair continued. "The custodying, the create, the redeem. This is a big step, not just for Bitcoin but for finance generally."
The SEC is expected to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs by the end of day Wednesday. Bloomberg reported yesterday that if approved, the ETFs could be listed and starting to trade as soon as the next business day.]]></summary>
