SEC’s Rules Are “So Vague And Loosey-goosey”
 
Alderoty shared a part of the Judge’s statement in the case of NCPPR v. SEC in an X (formerly Twitter) post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Concerning the fate of cryptocurrency entrepreneur Do Kwon,  
a Montenegrin court has ruled in favor of his extradition to his native South  
Korea. The decision marks the latest twist in the legal saga that unfolded  
following Kwon's arrest in the Balkan nation last year.
Appeals Court Reverses Decision: Extradition to US  
Overturned
The High Court's ruling came swiftly after an appeals court  
overturned its previous decision to extradite Kwon to the United States, where  
he faces charges related to a $40 billion crash of Terraform Labs'  
cryptocurrency. Kwon, aged 32, was apprehended on an international arrest

As pointed out by CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno in a new post on X, the BTC miners have recently seen daily total revenues close to the all-time record.
 
The “daily revenue” here refers to a measure of the combined income that the Bitcoin miners are making from block rewards and transaction fees (both in USD) every day.
 
 
The block rewards are what miners receive as compensation for solving blocks on the network, while the transaction fee is what they get for handling individual transactions.
