        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the main stage of Bitcoin 2024, Rep. Wiley Nickel (D-NC) shared that he’s working to have the Democrats shift to a more pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto stance.
He told the audience at the event that he’d recently written a letter to the DNC signed by 28 Democrats, 14 of which are in Congress, advocating for a new approach to digital asset policy from the party and its presidential nominee.
Rep. Nickel explained that the new approach should include “pro-digital asset language in the party’s platform, selecting a vice presidential candidate sophisticated in digital asset policy, selecting a pro-innovation SEC chair, and engaging with the industry in a meaningful way.”
We followed up with Rep. Nickel in efforts to learn more about how he plans to get the Democrats on the Bitcoin bandwagon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Worldcoin, which once made headlines for its futuristic vision, is now at the center of turmoil. This time, conflict is making news, not innovation. Sam Altman of OpenAI’s cryptocurrency project is at the heart of this tempest as it struggles to accomplish its ambitious goal of a worldwide digital identification system.
 
 
Concerns about token dilution, market manipulation, and legal obstacles have put the project—which aims to scan irises for digital IDs and reward participants with free WLD tokens—under close investigation.
 
The Dilution Dilemma
 
The crypto community has opposed Worldcoin’s tokenomics. With just 2.7% of its total WLD tokens in circulation, the project’s completely diluted market valuation is shockingly $22.4 billion, while having a current worth of $648 million.

Thieriot, who stepped down as CEO but remains a Director at Upbit, previously led the company through the controversial period following the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, choosing not to delist XRP—a decision he claims was “subsequently proven to be the right decision by the courts.” His recent statements mark his return to public discourse on the platform after more than two years of silence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lightning Ventures, a VC firm in the Bitcoin space, launched Thunder Funder, a Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) portal, at the Bitcoin 2024 conference last week.  The platform aims to democratize early-stage investing in Bitcoin and open-source startups by allowing both accredited and non-accredited investors to participate. 
Thunder Funder leverages the Reg CF framework, which permits companies to raise up to $5 million annually from the public. For the first time, this opens up largely inaccessible startup investment opportunities to retail investors interested in the booming Bitcoin and open source sectors. 
Lightning Ventures has invested over $6.8 million in nearly 40 Bitcoin companies. With this new platform, "We're activating a new group of retail investors," said Mike Jarmuz, CEO of Thunder Funder.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
The founding team comprises CTO Uncle Rockstar, an early contributor to BTCPay Server, and COO Vivek Patel, who previously worked at PrimeTrust.
Max Keiser and Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten's El Zonte Capital invested in the Lightning Ventures $500,000 pre-seed round to launch the platform alongside Brad Mills and Chris Hunter.
With Thunder Funder, regular investors can now directly fund innovative Bitcoin projects that were previously only accessible to accredited and institutional investors. This could accelerate development and progress in the Bitcoin and open-source ecosystem.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/global-liquidity-hits-all-time-high-bitcoin-to-follow"/>
        <updated>2024-08-02T11:17:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to data from Bitcoin Magazine Pro, the global money supply, also known as global liquidity, has hit an all-time high of $95 trillion; Bitcoin investors and analysts closely watch this key indicator, as higher liquidity has historically preceded major bull runs.
Global liquidity is the total amount of money circulating in the global financial system. It encompasses the M2 money supply of major economies like the U.S., China, EU, Japan, etc. M2 includes cash, bank deposits, money market mutual funds, and other near-money assets.
This figure recently hit $95 trillion, approaching the $100 trillion milestone. The previous all-time high was around $95 trillion, as well, when Bitcoin hit a new ATH in March this year at $73,000 and $90 trillion when Bitcoin hit its peak of $69,000 in November 2021.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
Higher global liquidity encourages spending on riskier assets like Bitcoin. Past data shows a strong correlation between liquidity expansion and Bitcoin bull markets. This is because more money creation typically leads central banks to lower interest rates and implement quantitative easing. This dynamic has played out repeatedly over Bitcoin's history.
Some investors view Bitcoin as an alternative to the central banking system because it has a fixed supply schedule. Bitcoin could be poised for another price surge if the current upward liquidity trend persists.
Bitcoin has already recovered to around $64,500 after dipping below $60,000 briefly last month. With global liquidity hitting new highs, Bitcoin appears primed to continue its bull run.]]></summary>
