Lightning Labs mainnet Alpha launch last month was big news. Up till now Ethereum and Tron dominated smart contracts.

This new feature will equip developers with the tools needed to make Bitcoin a multi-asset network, enabling users to hold real-world assets like gold on the Bitcoin blockchain, marking a critical moment for Bitcoin’s evolution.

Bitcoin Has Rebounded Back Towards The $43,000 Mark
 
Just earlier, Bitcoin had plunged to a low of $40,500 as the market had witnessed some significant selling pressure. In the past day, however, BTC has already turned itself around, as it has recovered back above the $43,000 level.
 
 
The below chart shows the rollercoaster the cryptocurrency has gone through in the last few days:
 

 
 
As is usually the case, the other assets in the sector have also followed in the original cryptocurrency’s lead and turned themselves around, seeing surges of their own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, Montenegro’s appeals court overturned the extradition request for Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon. This reversal follows reports that Justice Minister Andrej Milovic had informally agreed to the extradition.
 
Kwon to Remain in Montenegro, Decision Lies With Justice Minister
 
For the time being, Kwon is set to stay in Montenegro, as the Appeals Court Council, on Dec. 14, overturned the Higher Court in Podgorica’s decision to extradite him to the United States. The case has now been remanded to the lower court for a fresh evaluation and ruling.
 
The court’s decision to halt Kwon’s extradition was invalidated due to a violation of specific legal protocols as per the Montenegrin Criminal Procedure Code. Notably, the court exceeded its jurisdiction. In Montenegro, a court’s function in extradition matters is merely to verify the legal grounds for such a request.
 
However, the power to actually suspend or defer the extradition of the ex-CEO of Terraform Labs is not within the court’s remit. This responsibility is solely vested in the Minister of Justice, following the Montenegrin legislation on international legal assistance in criminal matters. Here, the appeals court made a decision beyond its legal capacity, necessitating the annulment.
 
 
Confronting significant legal challenges from both the U.S. and South Korea, Kwon has unwaveringly refuted all allegations of fraud. His charges, filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and South Korean financial authorities, include commodities fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit fraud and manipulate the market. The ultimate decision to approve or deny Kwon’s extradition lies with the Justice Minister.

The need to handle transactions on the Bitcoin network has increased significantly as the Ordinals inscriptions become more visible.

NitroBetting.eu, a prominent Bitcoin-exclusive sportsbook, just released the first-of-their-kind Bitcoin Spot ETF betting lines.

With regard to ETF sponsors, at the time of writing, simultaneous approval for multiple applicants is the most favored scenario (-250), with Blackrock leading the pack as most favored for standalone approval (+120).

According to the latest report from CoinShares, digital asset investment products saw minor outflows of $16 million last week, with the majority of the outflows coming from Bitcoin. However, despite the outflows, Solana picked up steam, with its net inflow jumping 240% percent from the previous week.
