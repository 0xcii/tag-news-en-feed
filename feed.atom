As it continues to gain widespread popularity, it has drawn the attention of execs at the crypto firm. Most especially, David Schwartz, who serves as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Ripple. Schwartz has addressed the calls for the escrowed coins to be burned, proposing a way that this could actually be done.

The crypto founder was found guilty of all seven charges after co-mingling his clients’ funds with that of his trading arm, Alameda Research. Billions of dollars were lost, which led SBF to jail. However, only now do his victims and the public get a glimpse into his life in prison.

Now that two of the most highly-anticipated Layer 2 solutions, Taproot Assets (TA) and RGB, are either available or imminent, it’s time to revisit this subject. Indeed, it may be past time judging by recent fee spikes driven by a resurgence of interest in BRC-20 tokens...
Following my view that the price, fee, and flexibility advantages offered by L2 metaprotocol solutions over on-chain Ordinals will ultimately prove decisive, I’ve focused my energies on advancing such solutions. Over the last few months, I’ve been deeply involved in both TA and RGB projects. In early September, I established a group in which the developers of L2 metaprotocol wallets…]]></summary>
