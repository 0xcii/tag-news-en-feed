        <updated>2023-10-23T12:51:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week surging towards the $31,000 level, as the S&P 500 fell to a four-month low. Momentum in crypto markets has remained mostly bullish in recent days, following speculation on upcoming exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals by the United States SEC. Ethereum rose above the $1,700 mark.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin climbed to a fresh multi-month high to start the week, as market sentiment remained high following speculation on potential ETF approvals.
 
After trading at a low of $29,734 on Sunday, BTC/USD peaked at the $30,951 level during today’s session.
 
This move saw bitcoin climb to its strongest level since July 14, when price hovered close to $32,000.

Monday’s gains sent the relative strength index (RSI) above the 76.00 mark for the first time since the beginning of the year.
 
As a result of the cryptocurrency being extremely overbought, bears that are currently sidelined could be pondering reentry.
 
In the event that this comes into fruition, sellers could aim to push bitcoin to a long-term floor of $29,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rallied above the $1,700 level on Monday, hitting a three-week high in the process.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,705.37 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,623.98.
 
As a result of today’s high, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency climbed to its highest level since the start of the month.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
The move saw ethereum climb for a fifth straight session, which came as the RSI broke out of a resistance at 60.00.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 62.40, with the next visible ceiling on the index at the 65.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, ethereum is trading at $1,676.39.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trial of the former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), is fast approaching the verdict stage as the prosecution closed its case last week. Following this, Bankman-Fried and his lawyers are set to open their defense (or maybe not) this week in what could prove very pivotal as to the direction of the case and SBF’s fate. 
 
What Will Sam Bankman-Fried’s Lawyers Do?
 
Specifically, SBF’s trial will continue on October 26, when he and his lawyers will need to inform the court on what step they intend to take next. As to the next steps they can take, they can either choose to open a defense and present witnesses and evidence to the jury. They can also choose to waive the case and not put up any defense. 
 
They will most likely have to put up a defense, conside…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has come under intense selling pressure, with crypto analyst Nicholas Merten, known as the host of DataDash, predicting a significant downward leg for the leading cryptocurrency. In a recent strategy session, Merten expressed concerns that BTC is primed for a bearish move.
 
Merten’s analysis revolves around the persistent resistance that Bitcoin has encountered at a critical channel. 
 
“The question here is whether or not we’re going to be able to clear through this channel of resistance, which each and every time has proven as resistance for Bitcoin,” the analyst said. He emphasized that this recurrent resistance could pave the way for a substantial downward move.

a year marked by the resurgence of cryptocurrencies, the global interest in  
cryptocurrency storage applications has experienced a notable decline. Recent

Declining  
Interest in Crypto Wallets
This

Deaton tweeted, “When the XRP case was filed on Clayton’s last day in charge at the SEC, I immediately pointed out the massive conflicts of interest by him voting to bring an enforcement action against Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen.”

quarter of 2023 has been challenging for the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) market,  
with sales hitting their lowest point since the last quarter of 2020. September  
alone recorded a dismal sales figure of around $300 million. This downturn is primarily  
attributed to a significant drop in average sales prices and floor prices of  
popular collections.
The Downward Spiral of NFT  
Sales
The NFT  
market has been on a downward trajectory, particularly in September, which saw  
the worst sales figures since January 2021. The average sales price in September  
plummeted to $38.17, a stark contrast to its peak of $791.84 in August 2021.

From the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum (ETH) has witnessed a notable resurgence, reclaiming ground after hitting a crucial support level at $1,500. As traders analyze the daily time frame, it becomes evident that this resurgence may signify the formation of a bullish reversal pattern, known as a double bottom. 
 
A double bottom is a classic technical analysis pattern that often signals a potential trend reversal. It consists of two troughs or valleys formed on a price chart. In this case, Ethereum touched the $1,500 support level twice, suggesting strong buying interest at this price point. 
 
This pattern indicates that bears may have exhausted their selling pressure, and buyers are gaining control, potentially setting the stage for a bullish move.
