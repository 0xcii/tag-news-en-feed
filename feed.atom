        <updated>2024-10-22T18:00:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stripe plans to acquire the stablecoin infrastructure 
provider Bridge to strengthen its position in the fintech and crypto markets. 
This acquisition is estimated to be valued at $1.1 billion, Forbes reported. According to sources familiar with the matter, 
Stripe's purchase aims to enhance international money transfers and bolster its 
payment solutions for businesses globally. 
The company was founded by John and Patrick Collison 
in 2010 and has established itself in the payment processing sector, with a 
valuation of 65 billion earlier this year.
Expanding Stablecoin Services
Stripe reportedly confirmed the acquisition of Bridge, 
which specializes in enabling businesses to use stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar, for 
transactions.
Bridge has experienced remarkable growth, reporting a 
tenfold increase in business this year alone. CEO Zach Abrams noted the 
company's rapid expansion and its existing clientele, which includes notable 
firms like Coinbase and SpaceX. 
Bridge will reportedly serve as a Web3 version of 
Stripe, enabling seamless payment solutions for digital transactions worldwide. The acquisition comes at a time when digital currencies are gaining 
traction, largely due to recent decisions by the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) that have eased regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies. 
This shift has encouraged major companies, including 
PayPal, to embrace digital currencies. PayPal launched its own US dollar 
stablecoin last year.
International Transactions
Although the details about the timeline for the 
acquisition were not disclosed, the move could position Stripe to compete effectively in the digital finance space. By integrating Bridge's capabilities, 
Stripe aims to enhance its offerings and provide businesses with better 
solutions for international transactions.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.
