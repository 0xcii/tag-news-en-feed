        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The current CEO of failed crypto exchange FTX, John Ray, showed his face and shed light on the company’s operations. Ray was appointed as part of the exchange’s bankruptcy proceeding to lead the investigation surrounding recent events. 
 
 
The U.S. Congress House Financial Services Committee summoned John Ray to testify. The former CEO of FTX and co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) appeared before this entity in 2022. At that time, SBF spoke about regulations and was considered one of the crypto industry advocates in Washington. 
 
Now, Bankman-Fried was arrested. The former executive could face life in prison due to his involvement in the FTX saga for defrauding his customers, creditors, and even the politicians speaking with the current FTX CEO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin has experienced a mini-rally after a low CPI read suggests rate hike slowing will happen soon.
The price of bitcoin ($BTC) has jumped ~5% to nearly $18,000 after the most recent Consumer Price Index reading from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reflected a lower number than the 7.3% projected by economists.
At 7.1%, CPI has now reached its lowest levels since December of 2021, which was the highest reported month that year. After two years of sustained inflation as a result of the Federal Reserve’s COVID-19 stimulus, the Fed was forced to aggressively hike rates in order to prevent runaway inflation. The latest CPI print confirms their aggressive actions have had an impact, although food and energy in particular maintain high levels of inflation (10.6% and 13.1% respectively). 
Bitcoin, an asset often viewed as risk-on in traditional markets, benefits from low rate environments. The latest CPI print reinforces the narrative that the Fed will now shift to a slow down in its rate hikes, which could explain the current pump in bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin began its descent from the mid-$40,000 range in April of 2022 and has been hovering below $20,000 since June of this year. Contagion from the failure of the Three Arrows Capital hedge fund ultimately sparked this fall, which has only since been exacerbated by the collapse of industry titan FTX.
This CPI print leads into a FOMC meeting behind closed doors this week, which is expected to yield a decision on Wednesday as well as projections for key economic indicators looking forward into 2023.]]></summary>

Bitcoin Short-Term Realized Volatility Is Now Lowest Since October 2020
 
As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, BTC has been rather silent in this month of December, compared to what was a very chaotic rest of the year. The relevant indicator here is the “annualized realized volatility,” which measures the standard deviation of daily returns from the mean for the Bitcoin market.
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means the price of the crypto has been showing large daily fluctuations recently. Such values imply the crypto currently involves high trading risk. On the other hand, low volatility values suggest t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin surged to a one-month high on Dec. 13, ahead of the latest inflation report from the United States. It is expected that consumer prices will fall to 7.3% in November, which would be a drop of 0.4% from the month prior. Ethereum was also higher in today’s session, as prices neared the $1,300 mark.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a one-month high on Tuesday, as markets began to price in a fall in consumer prices in the United States.
 
Following a low of $16,966.59 to start the week, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $17,457.30 earlier in today’s session.
 
This move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency fly to its strongest point since November 11, when price was at a high of $17,645.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, today’s surge comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved beyond a ceiling of its own.
 
The index climbed above a resistance level of 52.00 earlier in the day, and as of writing is tracking at 55.00.
 
Despite this afternoon’s report, we will likely see more volatility on Wednesday, as traders get ready for the upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve rate decision.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also rose in today’s session, as bulls reentered the market, taking prices close to the $1,300 level.
 
ETH/USD raced to a high of $1,294.10 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after hovering at a low of $1,248.36.
 
As a result of today’s move, ETH/USD moved closer to a recent resistance level of $1,300, as prices were almost 4% higher than Monday’s peak.
 
 
Like with bitcoin, bullish sentiment in ethereum returned following a breakout of a resistance level at the 53.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 53.75, and now seems to be moving towards a ceiling of 55.00.
 
ETH will likely recapture the $1,300 level, however what happens at that level is the key question for traders.
