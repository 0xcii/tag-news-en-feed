        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Swedish financial regulator reported a troubling  
trend in investment fraud targeting Bitcoin users during the third quarter of  
2023. The Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) said thousands of consumers fall  
victim to various schemes yearly. 
In the third quarter, approximately 1,216 companies  
targeted private individuals through investment fraud. According to the FSA,  
this significant increase, as compared to the previous year, underscores the  
continuous growth of investment scams.
Mikael Sandahl, the Financial Inspector at the FSA,  
said in a statement translated from Swedish: "Fraud is an important and  
growing source of funding for criminal gangs and turns over billions of  
dollars. With promises of easy investments and big profits, consumers are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rallied to a three-month high on Friday, as market optimism grew that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could soon approve several spot bitcoin ETFs. As reported yesterday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that the regulator is currently reviewing up to ten filings for the product. This comes as the commission also opted to drop its lawsuit against senior leadership at Ripple (XRP).
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin surged to a multi-month high in today’s session, as markets remained optimistic that the SEC could soon approve several spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
 
BTC/USD surged above $30,000 as sentiment grew, hitting a peak at $30,104.09 earlier in today’s session.
 
This comes following a low of $28,449.96 on Thursday, with today’s peak the strongest point bitcoin has hit since July 23.

On a technical level, the breakout of a ceiling at 69.00 on the relative strength index (RSI) also contributed to the gains.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now at a reading of 71.14, which is in overbought territory.
 
There has also been some slight profit taking in the market, with bitcoin now trading at $29,475.77.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also higher on Friday, with the cryptocurrency once again rising above the $1,600 level.
 
Following a low of $1,553.03 on Thursday, ETH/USD jumped to a peak at $1,628.61 earlier in the day.
 
This resulted in ethereum climbing to its highest point since the start of the week, when price was over $1,640.

Today’s hump comes days after bulls rejected a breakout below a support point of $1,540, and they now look to be targeting resistance of $1,650.
 
In order to get there, the RSI, which is currently reading at 51.81, will need to move beyond its own ceiling at 55.00.

Regulatory  
scrutiny has become unavoidable
One of the most  
important lessons gained in 2023 is that regulatory monitoring in the crypto

increasingly focused in cryptocurrencies, recognizing their growing impact on  
financial markets and the need for control.
