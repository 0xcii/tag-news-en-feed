        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Huobi Global's  
HTX exchange fell victim to a major hack on September 24, resulting in the loss  
of $7.9 million worth of digital assets. The breach was brought to light by  
blockchain analytics platform Cyvers, sending shockwaves through the crypto  
community.
However, what  
sets this incident apart is the exchange's claim to have unmasked the hacker's  
identity and a surprising offer of a "white-hat bonus" to the  
culprit, provided they return most of the stolen funds. A message, written in  
Chinese, emerged from a known Huobi hot wallet, addressed directly to the  
hacker.

One side calling for the complete phasing-out of the other. While their opposition is pointing to hypocrisies, chiefly: the heavy reliance on demonized resources in order to develop their operations throughout the production, deployment, operation, and maintenance stack – effectively increasing the demand for that which was demonized in the first place.

Chainlink Has Enjoyed Notable Returns During The Past Week
 
While the rest of the digital asset sector has been struggling recently, Chainlink has stood out as a coin that has registered a rapid uptrend. The price has continued this recent run during the past day as well, as its price is now floating above the $7.2 level.
 

 
 
During the past week, every coin except LINK inside the top 20 assets by market cap has seen negative returns. LINK’s strong gains, thus, make it by far the best performer in the sector.
 
 
Despite the strong performance in the past month, though, Chainlink has still not recovered back to the levels it was at before the crash in August. Nonetheles…]]></summary>

After eight transactions totaling 520 BTC from 2012 spent four days ago, an address from 2012 moved 149.99 BTC at block height 809,204 on Sunday afternoon. The wallet, dormant for more than 11 years, began with a value of $853. Today, the cache’s value has surged to a significantly larger net worth of $3.93 million. The following day, an address established on the identical date as the prior 2012 transaction shifted 157.66 BTC in the wee hours of Monday.

What Reed Has To Say About SBF’s Parents
 
In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Stark stated that it feels unusual that the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) haven’t added Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents as defendants in their son’s case. 
 
 
The former SEC attorney mentioned how he served in the Commission for almost 20 years and “led dozens of SEC prosecutions,” suggesting that if it were to be like before, the SEC would have acted and brought an action against Allan Bankman and Barbara Fried. For one, he s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that underscores MicroStrategy's unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, the software company has added 5,445 more BTC to its corporate treasury.
The latest acquisition, made on September 24, 2023, comes at an average price of approximately $27,053 per Bitcoin, amounting to an investment of $147.3 million.
This purchase brings MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings to a staggering 158,245 BTC, acquired at an average price of around $29,582 per Bitcoin, equivalent to approximately $4.68 billion. 
MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, has been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin, touting it as digital gold and emphasizing its role as a strategic treasury reserve asset. This latest acquisition further cements MicroStrategy's position as one of the most prominent institutional investors in Bitcoin.
The move comes as no surprise to those following MicroStrategy's journey in the world of cryptocurrencies. The company first ventured into Bitcoin investments in August 2020 when it made its initial purchase. Since then, it has continued to accumulate Bitcoin, even using debt to finance some of its acquisitions.
All the while, Saylor has continued to assert that Bitcoin is "underestimated" compared to other crypto market opportunities, as this video from Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo shows. Saylor has repeatedly said that altcoins are overvalued and should be sold.
With the growing recognition of Bitcoin's value as a store of value and a potential hedge against economic uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether more institutions will follow in MicroStrategy's footsteps.]]></summary>
