Is Bitcoin Inside A Wyckoff Re-accumulation Phase?
 
Taking to X, the analyst believes Bitcoin might be forming a Wyckoff Re-accumulation pattern on the daily chart. This means the coin could consolidate in a trading range before catapulting higher in the days ahead.

JUST IN: 🇺🇸 FBI warns Americans against using non-KYC #Bitcoin and crypto money transmitting services. pic.twitter.com/BkSuG6MiCE
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 25, 2024
  
  
  
This announcement, identified as Alert Number I-042524-PSA, urged Americans to only engage with registered Money Services Businesses (MSBs) that comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.
According to United States federal law, cryptocurrency money transmitting services must be registered as MSBs and adhere to AML requirements (31 U.S.C. § 5330; 31 CFR §§ 1010; 1022). The FBI says failure to comply may result in financial disruptions during law enforcement actions, particularly if funds are mixed with illegally obtained money.
The warning clarified that services that knowingly facilitate illegal transactions or violate federal laws are subject to investigation by law enforcement agencies, and that individuals using such services may lose access to their funds during enforcement operations.
Just yesterday, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) arrested the founders and CEO of popular privacy focused Bitcoin wallet and mixer, Samourai Wallet, and charged them with laundering “more than $100 million in criminal proceeds.” The DOJ then worked with law enforcement in Portugal and Iceland to arrest one of the founders, and seized Samourai's web servers and domain, in addition to serving a seizure warrant on the Google Play Store for its mobile app.]]></summary>

Sentiment And Technical Indicators Favor Altcoins
 
This assessment is based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which measures the profitability of held assets over one-month, three-month, and six-month periods. Such data suggest that despite recent market volatility, the potential for a significant bullish rally in the altcoin sector remains high.

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Picks Up
 
The Shiba Inu burn was an initiative that begun over a year ago as community members worked to reduce the supply of the meme coin. With a large supply of over 500 trillion, it has posed an hindrance to the coin’s growth, making a rally to $1 an impossible feat at this point. So, in an effort to increase its value, SHIB community members began sending tokens to a burn address.
