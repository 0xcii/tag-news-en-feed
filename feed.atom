-Michael Lewis, The Big Short.

Renowned author Michael Lewis published his book, Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon, on the rise and fall of FTX on the first day of the trial of its notorious founder Sam Bankman-Fried (Bankman-Fried). The book has met with heavy criticism by commentators for its seemingly favorable portrayal of the millennial crypto founder. 
It’s funny because at its core, the story of Bankman-Fried is a very old-school, Big Short-esque tale of a privileged actor who leveraged, for his own gain, our society’s predilection to make value judgements on people not due to their t…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-12T16:14:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP has been one of the week’s most notable movers, with price moving lower for six straight days. The latest decline comes as the global cryptocurrency market cap fell by over 1% in today’s session. Solana also slipped, nearing a floor of $21.00 in the process.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was once again in the red on Thursday, as price fell for a sixth consecutive session.
 
Following a high at $0.4889 on Wednesday, XRP/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.4756 earlier in today’s session.
 
This resulted in the cryptocurrency closing in on a recent point of support around the $0.4670 region.
 
 
Overall, bears have controlled market momentum since a failed breakout of a resistance level at $0.5440.
 
At the time of writing, the relative strength index (RSI) is at 35.31, which is marginally above a floor at 31.00.
 
In the event the RSI reaches this point, there is a good chance that price will fall to its aforementioned floor at $0.4670.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) also edged lower in today’s session, as price neared a key support level earlier in the day.
 
SOL/USD hit a low of $21.28 on Thursday, which comes a day after the token peaked at a level of $22.29.
 
As a result of the decline, the world’s seventh largest cryptocurrency dropped towards a price floor of $21.00.
 
 
Currently, price strength is now sitting at 48.69, which is below a support level of its own at 49.00.
 
Should the index continue to move further away from this point, there is a strong possibility that SOL slips closer to $20.00.

Bitcoin 7-Day Mining Hashrate Continues To Discover New Highs
 
The “mining hashrate” is an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that the miners have currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that the miners are finding the network profitable right now, so new ones are joining in, and/or old ones are expanding their facilities.
 
 
On the other hand, decreasing values suggest some miners have decided to disconnect from the blockchain, potentially because of the cryptocurrency not being profitable to mine currently.

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoins-first-trade-now-worth-130-million-"/>
        <updated>2023-10-12T14:35:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fourteen years ago today, on October 12, 2009, a historic moment unfolded in the world of Bitcoin as Bitcoin saw its first-ever trade for U.S. dollars. 
This pivotal event, orchestrated by Martti "Sirius" Malmi, a developer who worked with Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto on some of its earliest software versions, marked the birth of its circular economy.
In this inaugural trade, Malmi exchanged 5,050 Bitcoins for a mere $5.02, valuing each Bitcoin at a fraction of a cent. 
Fast forward to the present day, and the price appreciation of Bitcoin has been nothing short of astounding. With Bitcoin's current value exceeding $26,000 per coin, that humble $5 trade from 2009 is now worth an astonishing $130 million. 
This exceptional price growth over the years has made early Bitcoin enthusiasts and adopters witnesses to a true financial revolution.
The trade was revealed by Malmi in 2014, when he wrote on Twitter (now X): "Found the first known bitcoin to USD transaction from my email backups. I sold 5,050 BTC for $5.02 on 2009-10-12."
The tweet was resurfaced today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo.
This remarkable milestone not only highlights the dramatic increase in Bitcoin's value but also serves as a testament to the innovation and resilience of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's ability to disrupt traditional financial systems and establish itself as a store of value has reshaped the financial landscape. It continues to draw attention from investors, institutions, and individuals seeking financial freedom and security.
As the Bitcoin community celebrates the 14th anniversary of the first U.S. dollar trade, it's an opportunity to reflect on the profound impact this digital currency has had on the world of finance. The legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto, Martti Malmi, and countless others who have contributed to Bitcoin's growth remains a testament to the ongoing evolution of the revolution.]]></summary>

Given the rapid pace and depth of these developments, we’ve distilled the most jaw-dropping moments.
 
SBF And Ellison’s Manipulated Bitcoin Price
 
In a sensational revelation, Caroline Ellison admitted that there was a coordinated effort between her and SBF to maintain Bitcoin’s price below $20,000. “Keep selling BTC if it’s over $20K,” Ellison allegedly noted from one of their conversations. The motivation behind this move, according to Ellison, was to entice investors by selling equity, thus raising more funds.
