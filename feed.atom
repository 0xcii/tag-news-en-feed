Backed by a substantial $120 million investment from renowned backers Multicoin and Coinbase, the network’s ambitions are high. 
 
However, the journey toward its current stage has been marred by a series of challenges, including disgruntled participants in its airdrop program.
 
As SEI Network launched, excitement was palpable in the crypto community, fueled by company representatives hinting at the immediate availability of airdrop claims. 
 
 
This promise was quickly dashed when an official Tweet clarified that tokens would only become claimable after an unspecified “warmup” period, triggering a wa…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ltc-xrp-plunge-15-lower-on-friday/"/>
        <updated>2023-08-18T16:08:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin was one of the notable movers during Friday’s crypto blood bath, as markets reacted to speculation that Spacex had sold over $370 million in bitcoin. Today’s sell-off saw the global market cap fall by roughly 6.20%, at the time of writing. XRP also fell significantly.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) fell by as much as 15% on Friday, as a red wave washed over the cryptocurrency market.
 
LTC/USD fell to a low of $61.76 late on Thursday, which came following a high of $74.73 earlier in the day.
 
This decline pushed LTC to its lowest point since December 19, when price traded to a low of $61.00.
 
 
As a result of this sell-off, the relative strength index (RSI) fell below the 30.00 level, which means price is oversold.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 18.21, which is its weakest point since November 2018.
 
The price has since moved away from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $64.80.
 
 
XRP
 
Additionally, XRP, formerly ripple, also had significant declines on Friday, falling to a multi-month low of its own.
 
After climbing to a high of $0.5852 on Thursday, XRP/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.4681 later in the session.
 
The move saw XRP dive to its weakest point since May 16, when the price traded around the $0.4300 region.
 
 
This drop saw the token marginally break out of a key support point at $0.4600, wiping out all gains accrued following the ripple ruling.
 
Like with bitcoin above, price strength is now oversold, which prompted bulls to reenter, pushing XRP slightly higher.
 
As of writing, the token is trading at $0.5087.

This latest wave of liquidations, however, seemed to have swept up not just regular players but also an entity behind one of last year’s most significant crypto heists.
 
The Great Heist And The Liquidation Trail
 
A Bloomberg report, citing data from PeckShield, revealed that a crypto wallet that had ties to a roughly $600 million BNB theft last October, faced a liquidation of digital assets amounting to $63 million on the crypto lending platform, Venus Protocol.
 
 
The analysis from PeckShield illustrated that the hacker collateralized the stolen crypto to obtain a loan. Particularly, by offering the pilfered BNB as security, the bad actor …]]></summary>

In recent weeks, a consortium of firms, including Valkyrie, Roundhill, Proshares, Grayscale, Vaneck, Volatility Shares, and Bitwise, have submitted applications to roll out ethereum (ETH)-based futures products. A Thursday report by Bloomberg’s Vildana Hajric and Allyson Versprille reveals the SEC’s likely inclination towards not obstructing ETH-based futures.

I want to tell you about a personal transformation that I underwent last year while I crossed the U.S., visiting over 30 Bitcoin meetups around the country. In a little over three months, I covered 11,000 miles of country road on my Harley Davidson and was fortunate to shake thousands of hands.
What I called the “Bitcoin Tour” started with an idea: a great American road trip to see and meet the people who exuded hope during a dark chapter of world history. These people are Bitcoiners, congregating in local bars to share a passion and a way of thinking that’s rare in today’s society.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bears ran through crypto markets on Friday, following reports that Elon Musk’s Spacex had sold all of its bitcoin holdings. It has been suggested that Spacex liquidated over $370 million worth of the cryptocurrency last year. Ethereum dropped below $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) bears pushed the cryptocurrency to a two-month low on Friday, following news that Spacex had liquidated all of its holdings BTC.
 
After peaking at $28,525.11 during Thursday’s session, BTC/USD plunged to a bottom at $25,409.11 late last night.
 
This was the weakest point that bitcoin had fallen to since June 16, when price was near a breakout below $25,000.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that the sell-off came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell deep into oversold territory.
 
The index is now tracking at 20.10, which is the lowest level it has hit since January 2022, which ironically was when Tesla began to sell off its own holdings in bitcoin.
 
Price has somewhat rebounded from earlier lows, and is now trading at $26,341.67.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also moved significantly lower following the news, slipping below $1,600 in the process.
 
ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,551.71 on Friday, down nearly $200.00 from Thursday’s peak.
 
This is the weakest reading for ethereum since March 12, when price was trading below the $1,459 level.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Like with BTC above, today’s sell-off has moved the RSI into a bear zone, with a current reading of 21.30.
 
This could work in the favor of bulls looking to buy the dip, and to a degree already has, with ETH now trading at $1,678.05.

In the interview, Pompliano discussed a range of topics with host Brian Sullivan, shedding light on the recent developments within the crypto sphere.
 
Holding steadfast to his convictions, Pompliano dismissed concerns about the volatility of the crypto market, drawing parallels to a similar downturn in 2018 when Bitcoin’s price plummeted from $20,000 to $3,700.
