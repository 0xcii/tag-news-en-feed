NFT Market Down 92% From January 2022 Peaks: Best Time To Invest?

The film suggests that Canadian Bitcoin developer Peter Todd is Satoshi Nakamoto. However, Todd himself has publicly denied this identification.
 
In response to the documentary’s claims, several experts have come forward to debunk the theory proposed by director Cullen Hoback, who based his conclusion on four arguments, as reported by Bitcoinist earlier today. Among those refuting the claim is Billy Markus, co-founder of Dogecoin and known online as Shibetoshi Nakamoto. Taking to X, Markus stated, “It’s not Peter Todd bro.”
