        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that Ethereum transaction fees have been rising again recently. Here’s what could be behind this trend.
 
Ethereum Average Fees Has Registered A Notable Uptick Recently
 
In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment talked about how the Ethereum network has recently become more expensive. The metric of interest here is the “Average Fees,” which keeps track of the average fees that ETH users are currently attaching with their transfers.

In times of high traffic, transfers can get stuck for a while, as ETH has only a limited capacity to handle transactions. Those looking to beat the crowd, thus, go with a higher-than-average fee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent interview with CNBC, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, a prominent advocate for crypto assets, discussed the potential for significant regulatory changes following the upcoming US elections. 
 
With just under two months until voters head to the polls, Lummis emphasized the need for a robust digital asset framework to support the US economy.
 
Lummis Urges Congress To Lead In Crypto Regulation
 
While there has been notable progress, including the approval of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Lummis pointed out that the US still lags behind the European Union’s ineffective regulation. 
 
The Senator highlighted that the EU began implementing its regulatory framework in January 2023. Lummis …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the ongoing gradual recovery in crypto prices, the latest data has shown a shift in sentiment among retail investors, particularly those in the Korean market, who appear to be more cautious.
 
A CryptoQuant analyst named Mac D recently published insights on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, highlighting the implications of this change.
 
 
Retail Interest Dwindles, What About Smart Money?
 
According to Mac D, the decline in retail investor participation is tied to the negative Korean premium indicator—a sign that local investors are losing interest in the crypto space.
 
 
The primary reason for this downturn, as Mac wrote, is linked to Bitcoin’s sideways price movement over the last six months, following its peak in March.

Sustained Bitcoin Rally Could Spark FOMO In Altcoins
 
In a recent report, Thielen outlined several factors that could set the stage for a crypto rally in the last quarter of 2024. According to the report, further upside for the crypto markets could be on the cards due to two key factors.
 
First, the acceleration in stablecoin minting signals rising interest among investors and traders in re-entering the crypto market.

This comes after Judge Analisa Torres rendered a landmark decision in July 2023, finding that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP to ordinary investors did not breach securities laws.
 
The SEC, however, is apparently not happy with this ruling, especially in light of how it would affect any future regulatory proceedings.
