Critical insights came yesterday from Alexander Leishman, CEO and CTO of River, and David Marcus, an ex-Facebook executive and CEO of Lightspark. Their recent statements shed light on the potential and challenges which the LN is facing.
 
Leishman sparked the conversation by pointing out the challenges in user experience (UX) for consumer self-custody within the Lightning Network. He remarked, “Lightning is great for custodial to custodial transfers.
