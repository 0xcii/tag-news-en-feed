        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kaspa (KAS), one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in recent weeks, has seen a surge in interest from both retail and institutional investors. This interest has been fueled by the launch of new on-chain tools and the introduction of the KRC-20 standard, which allows developers to create a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Kaspa (KAS) blockchain. As a result, Kaspa (KAS)’s price has risen sharply, with many whales taking profits and looking for the next big opportunity.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez showed miners offloaded over 30,000 BTC in three days, indicating a sizable selling pressure originates within the Bitcoin community itself.
