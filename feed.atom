Whether the tokens created by Terraform Labs constitute securities is central to the SEC’s fraud case, alleging that the company defrauded investors and sold billions of dollars in unregistered securities.
 
 
Terraform Labs’ Coins In The Hot Seat
 
The SEC’s complaint alleges that Terraform Labs and Kwon misled investors about the stability of TerraUSD and falsely claimed that their crypto tokens would increase in value. 
 
At a hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff questioned whether Terraform Labs’ offering of an Anchor protocol, which…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-16T18:13:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a Fortune report published on June 16, the cryptocurrency asset platform Bakkt is delisting three cryptocurrencies due to the current regulatory climate. Bakkt’s general counsel stated that the platform will expand its coin offering once there is “further clarity.”
 
Bakkt Reacts to Regulatory Pressure, Delists Solana, Polygon, and Cardano
 
Bakkt, the New York-based digital asset platform, revealed Friday that it is delisting solana (SOL), polygon (MATIC), and cardano (ADA). The move comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intensifies its scrutiny of cryptocurrency platforms and designates certain assets as unregistered securities.
 
The announcement of Bakkt’s delisting of SOL, MATIC, and ADA was made by the company’s general counsel and secretary, Marc D’Annunzio, in an interview with Fortune. D’Annunzio stated that the proactive removal would continue “until there is further clarity on how to compliantly offer a more extensive list of coins.”
 
Prior to Bakkt’s decision, the digital trading platform Robinhood has chosen to delist cardano (ADA), solana (SOL), and polygon (MATIC). Similarly, Tel Aviv-based Etoro has announced the delisting of ALGO, MANA, DASH, and MATIC for U.S. customers, citing the same reasons. Both Robinhood and Etoro said the firms are implementing proactive measures until regulatory clarity is established in the United States.
 
 
All the tokens that were previously listed on Bakkt, Robinhood, and Etoro and subsequently delisted have been classified as unregistered securities by the U.S. SEC. The SEC’s enforcement lawsuits also identify XRP, TON, OMG, POWR, BTT, KIN, TRX, MIR, EMAX, ALGO, and IHT, among others, as securities.
 
Are the recent delistings by Bakkt, Robinhood, and Etoro a necessary step towards regulatory compliance, or do they hinder innovation in the cryptocurrency space? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halfway through June, crypto markets have been rocked by several macro factors, which have brought bears to return to action. Bitcoin has moved below $25,000 for the first time since March, as the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued both Binance and Coinbase. The Federal Reserve has also paused its rate hike policy, with traders still unsure of what this could mean for markets.
 
Current Market Status
 
The action taken by the SEC earlier this month has been the main source of bearishness, with the regulator moving to crack down on operators in the space.
 
Following this, inflation in the United States fell to lower than expected, coming in at a low of 4%, briefly boosting the U.S. dollar.
 
However, with the Fed opting to keep rates unchanged for now, market uncertainty has heightened, with traders processing the potential long-term impacts of tighter monetary policy.
 
June Outlook
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rose back above $25,000 on Friday, as traders moved to buy the recent dip in price.
 
The world’s largest cryptocurrency plunged to its weakest point since March 16 earlier this week, triggered by the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision.
 
Bulls that have returned to BTC in recent days would have done so due to prices being oversold, with the relative strength index (RSI) hovering below the 30.00 mark.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the index has now broken out of a ceiling at 43.00, and is tracking at 43.26, which has prompted a rise in momentum.
 
The next visible point of resistance is at the 50.00 mark, and 57.00 thereafter. Should bulls move beyond both of these, BTC will likely be trading above $27,500 in the next few weeks.
 
Where will bitcoin end the month? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.]]></summary>

Three Arrows Capital, which filed for bankruptcy in the United States in 2022, had originally purchased the 37 NFTs for $15.5 million worth of cryptocurrency in July and August 2021.

Several On-Chain Indicators Spiked While Tether Suffered A Depeg
 
In the past couple of days, USDT became decoupled from its $1 peg as the stablecoin’s value plunged to $0.996. Since then, however, the asset has seen some recovery, although the $1 peg is yet to be regained as Tether still trends under $0.999.
 
While this isn’t the first time that the largest stablecoin by market cap has observed destabilization, it’s natural that this depegging event has still led to the emergence of fresh FUD in the market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite a slight rebound in price, shiba inu remained near its lowest level in 21 months during Friday’s session. Overall, the global cryptocurrency market cap was marginally higher, climbing by 1% as of writing. XRP was an exception, dropping to a three-week low today.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) moved away from its lowest point in almost two years, as crypto bulls swept in to buy the recent dip in price.
 
Following a bottom of $0.00000653 on Thursday, SHIB/USD rose to a high of $0.00000682 earlier in the day.
 
This rally resulted in the meme coin moving away from last Saturday’s bottom at $0.00000600, which is the weakest point price has hit since September 2021.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the sell-off has eased, which came as SHIB began consolidating around a key support point of $0.00000635.
 
Overall, sentiment in the meme coin remains significantly bearish, with price strength tracking below the 30.00 level.
 
At the time of writing, the relative strength index (RSI) is tracking at 25.62, after bouncing from a recent floor at 21.00.
 
 
XRP
 
On the other hand, XRP, formerly ripple, extended a recent downtrend, with the token falling to a fresh multi-week low.
 
XRP/USD plunged to an intraday low of $0.4601 on Friday, a day after trading at a peak of $0.4833.
 
As a result of this decline, XRP fell by nearly 4% in today’s session, dropping to its lowest point since May 26 in the process.
 
 
In the last seven days the token has lost nearly 14% of its value, which comes after the price rose to a ten-week high on Tuesday.
 
Initially, it appears that bulls were likely capturing profits and liquidating their positions, however sentiment shifted, with bears using this as an opportunity to reenter the market.
 
Should this current trend continue, there is a good chance that XRP will hit a floor of $0.4200 in the near future.

Kaplan’s View On Ripple Lawsuit
 
The SEC filed a suit against the content distribution decentralized blockchain platform LBRY Credits in March 2021. The regulator alleged that LBRY violated securities law by offering unregistered LBC tokens.
