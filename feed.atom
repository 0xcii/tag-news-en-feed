This decision comes just a day after the Commission announced extending the deadline to decide on ARK Invest’s Spot Bitcoin ETF application to January 10, 2024. A decision on ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF wasn’t due until November 11.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum climbed to a fresh one-week high on Thursday, as bulls kept price above a key resistance level. The move comes despite cryptocurrencies mostly consolidating in today’s session, following Wednesday’s rally. Bitcoin was marginally lower, retreating from recent gains.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin edged marginally lower on Thursday, as crypto markets consolidated, following strong gains the day prior.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,111.46, less than 24 hours after nearing a breakout above the $27,000 level.
 
Overall, it appears that traders have opted to secure gains, abandoning their positions as markets neared a point of uncertainty.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this area appears to be 51.00 on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking at the 49.64 level, with bitcoin now trading at $26,481.46.
 
Should bulls navigate a surge beyond this point, there is a good chance that price could move back above $27,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) peaked at a one-week high earlier in the day, as price remained above a key level of resistance.
 
After trading at a low of $1,585.37 on Wednesday, ETH/USD raced to an intraday peak at $1,635.46 during today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, ethereum hit its highest point since September 20, when price reached a high of $1,649.
 
 
This surge comes as the RSI continued to track above a ceiling at the 48.00 mark.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average also now appears to be nearing its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which is another sign of pending bullish sentiment.
 
An upward crossover will likely result in ethereum moving above $1,700.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital found itself in the spotlight when it inadvertently mined an invalid block at height 809478 on the Bitcoin mainnet. The blunder was attributed to a transaction ordering issue, as revealed by pseudonymous Bitcoin developer and Spiral grant recipient 0xB10C. The incident underscores the intricacies and potential pitfalls of blockchain technology.
 
At the core of the issue was a transaction sequencing problem. Transaction A attempted to spend an input from transaction B, but here lies the crux: transaction B ended up being included in the block after transaction A. This seemingly minor misalignment in the chronological order of transactions rendered the entire block invalid.

Crypto Faces Its “5G Moment”
 
Armstrong described the current regulatory climate as one marked by the SEC’s “regulation by enforcement”, a condition he regards as “harassment” toward crypto startups due to the issuance of subpoenas without transparent guidelines.
