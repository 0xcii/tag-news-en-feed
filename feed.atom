        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Research reports have shown that Bitcoin’s layer 2 scaling solution, the Lightning Network – a layer separate from the main chain but interacting with the Bitcoin network, has experienced a significant growth of 1,212% in the space of two years.
 
Bitcoin Lightning Network Achieves New Height
 
According to the report from Bitcoin’s financial services River Financial, the Lightening Network’s 1,212% growth accounted for Routed transactions. Routed transactions basically involve more than two nodes, hence, the figure above could be significantly higher.  The network’s routed transactions have impressively increased from 503,115 in August 2021, to 6,599,553 by August 2023.
 
 
In the report, Sam Wouters, River research analyst said the numbers “came as a shock” due to the decline in Bitcoin …]]></summary>

This is part of Chainway's continued efforts to implement ZK rollups on bitcoin, a move that may offer enhanced scalability and privacy features to bitcoin.
Chainway's recent demonstration serves as a proof of concept, illustrating how their future ZK rollup is intended to function when integrated with bitcoin. This integration seeks to combine the flexibility and programmability commonly associated with EVM and the robust security infrastructure inherent to bitcoin.
Diving deeper into the mechanics, rollups work by grouping transactions occurring off-chain, batching them, and then publishing this consolidated batch onto the bitcoin …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum’s shift from a deflationary to an inflationary model has witnessed a 0.178% uptick in the last 17 days. During this period, the network added 22,502 ether, valued at $35.31 million, to its total supply.
 
Ethereum’s Growing Inflation Fueled by Onchain Downturn
 
Previously, Ethereum maintained a deflationary stance, primarily due to the London hard fork’s EIP-1559 and the notable shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Yet, the past few months saw a marked decline in onchain activities.
 
Consequently, the EIP-1559’s fee-burning mechanism has been torching fewer ethers. Just 17 days back, Ethereum’s issuance rate was slightly inflationary, standing at 0.270% annually. But as of now, it hovers around 0.448%, marking a rise of 0.178%.

Bitcoin Miners Have Sold 20,000 BTC In Past Week
 
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, BTC miners have done some significant selling during the last week. The relevant indicator here is the “miner reserve,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin that the miners as a whole are carrying in their wallets.
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that these chain validators are making deposits into their addresses currently. Such a trend suggests that the miners are accumulating right now, which can naturally be bullish for the asset’s price.
 
 
On the other hand, drawdowns in the indicator imply the miners are…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was marginally higher on Wednesday, after moving back above a recent support point during today’s session. The meme coin fell to a seven-week low on Monday, however bulls have moved to buy the dip. Toncoin was another token to rise, reentering the $2.00 region in the process.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) climbed back above a key support level in today’s session, after traders opted to buy a recent dip in price.
 
After slipping to a low of $0.05866 on Tuesday, DOGE/USD rose to an intraday peak at $0.05945 earlier in the session.
 
As a result, DOGE continued to move away from a price floor at $0.05840, which was broken on Monday, sending price to its lowest point since mid-August.
 
 
Today’s rebound comes after the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced away from its own support at 32.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 33.72, which is still close to the oversold region.
 
The next visible point of resistance now stands at 37.00, and if broken, there is a good chance that DOGE rises past $0.06000.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was another big gainer on Wednesday, as the token jumped away from a support point of its own.
 
TON/USD peaked at $2.03 earlier in the day, which came hours after hitting a low at the $1.98 mark.
 
Wednesday’s surge occurred as traders chose to maintain a floor at the $1.95 level, with a ceiling at $2.10 now a possible target.
 
 
In order to get there, price strength, which is now sitting at 46.42, will need to break a ceiling at 48.00.
 
There will be some difficulty in achieving this however, as the medium-term momentum in TON remains bearish, following last week’s downward crossover of moving averages.

events are not uncommon in the global financial scene, and they frequently
