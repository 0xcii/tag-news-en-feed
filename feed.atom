Private Key Leakage
 
According to X-explore, a market research platform, the recent Poloniex hacking incident was likely carried out by the North Korea-backed cybercriminal entity, the Lazarus Group. X-explore said it came to this conclusion after observing the hackers’ tactics which are somehow similar to those used by the group that breached Stake.com on Sept. 4, 2023.

Bithumb to Become a Publicly-Listed Crypto Exchange

The traditional way in which our society constructs ownership is inefficient. The Uber-for-X model solves part of the problem by exploiting the unused value of some long-tail assets, but the reason behind the existence of such a huge volume of long-tail assets remains a puzzle.

By doing so, we will embrace a full-scale sharing economy backed by Bitcoin, paving the way for a hyperbitcoinized civilization.
