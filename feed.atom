Ethereum, as a trailblazer in blockchain technology, follows a unique governance path distinct from Bitcoin, leaning on community-driven, decentralized processes rather than on-chain governance mechanisms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) is poised for a spectacular close to 2024, according to industry heavyweight Mike Novogratz. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, the Galaxy Digital CEO forecasted a price surge to $100,000 by year-end, fueled by a confluence of factors.
 
 
Breaking Through Barriers: The $73,000 Threshold
 
Novogratz’s prediction hinges on a crucial price point – $73,000. He believes surpassing this resistance level in the coming weeks could trigger a domino effect, propelling Bitcoin towards the coveted six-figure mark. His reasoning draws on the concept of “market ranges,” suggesting that once the top crypto establishes a foothold above $70,000, psychological factors could propel it further into the $100,000 territory.
 
Novogratz said:

This decision comes in response to an ongoing investigation by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD) into the company’s data collection and processing practices.
 
This pause reflects a broader scrutiny under which the Worldcoin project finds itself across various global jurisdictions.
 
The AEPD’s investigation is not isolated; similar concerns have been raised by data protection authorities in other countries, including Germany and Hong Kong.
 
These authorities are examining the extent and nature of Worldcoin’s biometric data collection, specifically the capture of iris and facial images, to create a universal digital identity.
