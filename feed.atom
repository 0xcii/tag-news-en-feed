        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the approval of options trading on BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) on Nasdaq, it was only a matter of time until the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authorized ETF options trading on other exchanges. On Friday, October 18, the commission permitted the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to offer options trading for several spot Bitcoin ETFs.
 
Specifically, the NYSE received the green light to list and trade options for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC (BTC), and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). CBOE, on the other hand, is now permitted to offer options trading on the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Samson Mow, founder of Bitcoin-focused company JAN3, recently addressed the German Bundestag in an effort to push for the state to adopt Bitcoin, thus pushing for “hyperbitcoinization” sooner to be able to live in a future where Bitcoin becomes every global citizen’s currency of choice.
 
 
Grassroots efforts pick up pace, but the founder cautions that it is only the existence of state-level adoption that will deliver the fiat-free world that many desire to see. To date, El Salvador remains the only country to legalize Bitcoin as a legal form of currency, an ongoing theme of a state refusing recognition leading to it being the space’s biggest opposition.
