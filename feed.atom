Novogratz on Global Credit Crunch and Recession
 
Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz shared his outlook for the U.S. economy in an interview with CNBC Wednesday. Comparing the current market condition to one in December 2018, he said: “This reminds me a lot of 2018, December, when the Fed had this idea of one last [interest rate] hike and, of course, it sent the market into a tailspin, and they had to reverse it soon after.”
 
Noting that “information has changed dramatically” in a short period of time, he explained:

Seven days later, gold rose 9.65% against the U.S. dollar to the current spot price of $1,988 per ounce. Gold’s rise comes at a time when confidence in the global banking system is at an all-time low, and five major banks have received bailouts.

In September 2022, the Ethereum blockchain network moved from its former Proof-of-Work system to the current Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. The move was necessary as the PoS consensus protocol is not energy-intensive but more secure and valuable for deploying new scaling solutions.

According to Grayscale’s announcement, the review extension will last 180 days. This will give the company ample time to decide the manner, the time, and the possibility of selling ETHPoW – the asset after the network’s Merge in September 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum classic rose by as much as 12% in today’s session, as cryptocurrency markets rallied to start the weekend. The global market cap is trading over 3% higher at the time of writing, as investors continue to buy crypto following the recent banking crisis. Solana was also higher in today’s session.
 
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
 
Ethereum classic (ETC) rose by as much as 12% in today’s session, as traders continued to pump cryptocurrencies.
 
Following a low of $19.14 on Friday, ETC/USD moved to a high of $22.46 to start the weekend.
 
The move came as ethereum classic rose back above a recent floor at $20.00, hitting its strongest point since February 22 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally also coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) breaking out of a ceiling at the 58.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 60.22, which is its highest reading since February 2.
 
The next visible point of resistance appears to be a ceiling at 65.00, which could lead to ETC moving closer to the $25.00 mark.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
In addition to ETC, solana (SOL) was also in the green to start the weeknd, with prices trading by as much as 9% higher.
 
SOL/USD rose to a peak of $22.54 earlier in today’s session, after falling to a floor at $19.94 the day prior.
 
As a result of Saturday’s surge solana has now moved to its strongest point since late-February.
 
 
Like with ETC, a catalyst for the move was a breakout which took place on the RSI indicator.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 55.71, which is above the aforementioned ceiling at 50.00
 
In the short-term bulls may attempt to send the token to $23.00, which is the next key price point for SOL.

This is an opinion editorial by Kishin Kato, the founder of Trustless Services K.K., a Japanese Lightning Network research and development company. 
Demand for stablecoins on Bitcoin is returning as the Lightning Network offers massive scalability advantages. Currently, users in emerging markets who want to transact and save in USD will settle for stablecoins on other chains, according to proponents. Putting my personal feelings about these other blockchains aside, I must acknowledge that bitcoin received in cheap, cross-border remittances cannot easily be sold for dollars while they reside in non-cust…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The banks that collapsed recently faced diverse challenges that affected their operations. For instance, Silvergate faced multiple regulatory actions due to its dealings with the bankrupt FTX exchange, its founder Sam Bankman-Fried and its sister company Alameda Research. It also cited the 2022 bearish market as part of the challenges that made it insolvent.
 
 
On the other hand, Silicon Valley Bank failed due to many losses in its operations and other factors. Signature Bank also faced challenges it couldn’t handle, leading to state intervention. 
 
Apart from these three banks, economists have discovered more than 186 banks in the United States are already positioned to crash.

        <updated>2023-03-18T12:21:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum rose above $1,800 for the first time since August, as markets continued to react to the Fed’s decision to inject $300 billion into the economy. This comes following the recent banking crisis, which saw the likes of Silicon Valley Bank collapse. Bitcoin neared $28,000 in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) closed in on the $28,000 level to start the weekend, as markets continued to react to the Federal Reserve’s decision to pump liquidity into the U.S. economy.
 
BTC/USD jumped to an intraday high of $27,787.81 earlier in the day, which comes after falling to a low of $26,209.29 on Friday.
 
As a result of the move, bitcoin climbed a fresh nine-month high, which is its strongest point since June 2022.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge took place as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continues to gain traction, moving deeper into overbought territory.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 72.53, which is the strongest reading for the index since February 2.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) continued to climb higher on Saturday, as prices surged above the $1,800 mark.
 
Following a low of $1,707.95 on Friday, ETH/USD raced to a peak of $1,821.31 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency move to its highest point since August 19.
 
 
Overall, ethereum is now up nearly 27% in the last seven days which, like with BTC, has resulted in an upward cross of moving averages.
 
Additionally, price strength is now firmly in bullish territory, with the RSI currently tracking at 67.11.
 
This is slightly above a ceiling at 67.00, with the next visible point of resistance at the 75.00 mark.
