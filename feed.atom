        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/crypto-exchange-digitex-ordered-to-pay-16m-following-cftc-charges/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-12T20:48:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A US court  
has ordered Adam Todd to pay approximately $16 million for operating an  
unregistered crypto exchange Digitex Futures. The amount includes $11.7 million  
in civil monetary penalty and $3.9 million as the return of illicit  
profit. 
Court Slams Trading Ban on Digitex Founder
Judge Roy  
K. Altman of the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida  
delivered the judgement on July 5, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  
(CFTC) announced  
today (Wednesday). Judge Altman also banned Todd and four companies he  
controlled from registering with the CFTC or engaging in any trading activities  
overseen by the US derivatives regulator. 
CFTC in  
September last year charged Todd  
and his digital asset derivatives trading firm, alleging that the exchange between  
May 2020 and May 2022 operated an unauthorized trading platform from a Florida-based office. The derivatives watchdog also accused the Digitex Founder of attempting to  
manipulate the price of the exchange’s native token, DGTX. In addition, it considers the token to be a  'commodity’ in interstate commerce.
“According  
to the complaint, throughout the summer of 2020—the time when the exchange was  
readying for ‘launch’—Todd repeatedly attempted to, in his words, ‘pump’  
the price of DGTX as reported by third-party exchange,” CFTC explained.
Furthermore, CFTC alleged that Digitex failed to establish a customer  
information program, know-your-customer policies and anti-money laundering  
procedures.
“This case  
demonstrates that regardless of the technology used, the CFTC will aggressively  
use its well-established authority to ensure entities are lawfully registered  
and to address the manipulation of commodities in interstate commerce,” noted  
Ian McGinley, Director of CFTC’s Division of Enforcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On July 12, 2023, onchain data shows the U.S. government transferred 9,800 bitcoins (BTC), worth just over $300 million. These bitcoins originally came from James Zhong’s Silk Road hack. In March, the Department of Justice also moved a similar amount of bitcoins associated with Silk Road.
 
Silk Road Bitcoin Stash Controlled by the Feds Moves, Funds Reportedly Sent to Coinbase
 
About 9,800 BTC from Silk Road was moved in two transactions on Wednesday, reportedly sent to wallets controlled by Coinbase. At the time of writing, the funds held by the U.S. government are worth $302 million, based on the day’s BTC exchange rates.
 
The bitcoins came from James Zhong, the convicted Silk Road hacker. At the time of his arrest, federal authorities seized about 51,351.89785803 bitcoins on three separate occasions, along with a collection of precious metals and $661,900 in cash.

Last March, the government sold 9,861 bitcoins for just over $200 million. The onchain activity four months prior was also detected by onchain observers and blockchain parsers. It’s speculated that all the BTC transferred from Zhong’s stash has been sold on Coinbase.
 
 
The selling through Coinbase is unusual as the U.S. government typically auctions off BTC with assistance from the U.S. Marshals. For example, bitcoins seized from Ross Ulbricht in the Silk Road case were auctioned, with investors like Tim Draper purchasing some of the coins. Only recently has the government started moving cryptocurrency to spot exchanges.

Report Shows Major Drop in Cryptocurrency Crimes
 
The significant drop in crypto crimes seems to be largely due to a major decline in scams and dark web market activity. From January through to the end of June, the total value of funds stolen from scam victims plummeted, resulting in a 65% decrease.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash rose by nearly 6% on Wednesday, following the release of the latest consumer price index (CPI) in the United States. Inflation fell by 1.0% from May, coming in at 3.0% last month. Polkadot also rose, extending its winning run for a third straight day.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) rose by as much as 6% earlier in today’s session. BCH/USD surged to a peak of $289.49 earlier in the day, which comes following Tuesday’s bottom at $271.44.
 
This rise in price has pushed the cryptocurrency towards a ceiling at $300.00, and closer to a recent 15-month high at $329.71.
 
 
From the chart, the move occurred after a marginal breakout of a ceiling at 68.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 70.56, with the next visible point of resistance at 73.00.
 
Should this point be hit, there is a strong chance that BCH will be trading at or over $300.00.
 
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) rose for a third consecutive day during Wednesday’s session, as price neared a one-week high.
 
After falling to a low at $5.13 on Tuesday, DOT/USD jumped to an intraday high of $5.30 earlier today.
 
This is the strongest level the token has hit since last Thursday, when it peaked at $5.37, marginally below a ceiling at $5.40.
 
 
Since today’s peak, earlier gains have somewhat slipped, as a result of the RSI colliding with a ceiling at 55.00.
 
Currently, price strength is at a reading of 54.55, with DOT now trading $0.05 lower than its previous high.
 
In the event this ceiling is broken, the next target for polkadot bulls will likely be $5.50.
