        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[North Korean hackers are taking it a notch higher by pretending to be venture capitalists to steal from cryptocurrency startups.
 
BlueNoroff, the name given by cybersecurity experts to a crew associated with the North Korean government-funded hacking operation Lazarus Group, has expanded its target list to include venture capital firms, cryptocurrency startups, and banks, a report by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab disclosed.
