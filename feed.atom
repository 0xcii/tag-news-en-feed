The Biden Administration has posted an official blog detailing its roadmap to mitigate the risks of cryptocurrencies.
The roadmap starts by citing the 2022 implosion of LUNA/Terra and the subsequent catastrophic contagion within the industry that led to various bankruptcies. Included in this reference is the bankruptcy of FTX, saying that, “Many everyday investors who trusted cryptocurrency companies—including young people and people of color—suffered serious losses, but, thankfully, turmoil in the cryptocurrency markets has had little negative impact on the broader financial system to date.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Texas Senator has introduced a resolution requesting Capitol vendors to accept bitcoin.
Sen. Ted Cruz (TX-R) has proposed a resolution that would request vendors within the Capitol area to work with payments providers that accept bitcoin.
The proposal specifically mentions that restaurants, gift shops and vending machines within Capitol Buildings should work with persons accepting cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which would allow the lawmakers of the United States to purchase their on-the-go snacks with sound money as they please. 
Sen. Ted Cruz has been an outspoken advocate for bitcoin before, saying that, “One of the reasons I’m bullish on Bitcoin is because it’s decentralized. The Left hates Bitcoin because they can’t control it.”



Sen. Cruz also sees the benefits of bitcoin mining as a potential boon for Texas, a state which has been at the forefront of the industry since China’s bitcoin mining ban and subsequent hash rate exodus in 2021.



While the move for acceptance at vendors may be perceived as inconsequential, if it passes, it could serve as the first primary exposure for Capitol politicians to using BTC as a daily payment method. Bitcoin can be an abstract concept for those who have not seen its usage in a payments setting, so small resolutions like this can possibly shift perspectives for an on-the-fence politician. The resolution will need to pass both the House and Senate in order to take effect.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon rose to its highest level since early November on Friday, as markets reacted to the latest U.S. consumer sentiment data. Sentiment rose to 64.9 in January, up from a reading of 59.7 in December. Chainlink also surged in today’s session, hitting its strongest point in nearly two months.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was a big gainer on Friday, as prices rose to their highest point in 11 weeks.
 
Following a low of $1.07 on Thursday, MATIC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1.15 earlier today.
 
As a result of this, polygon moved to its strongest point since November 11, which is the last time prices were trading at this point of resistance.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge took place when the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 69.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 72.14, and appears to be en route to a ceiling at the 77.00 mark.
 
Should this occur, there is a strong possibility that MATIC will be trading above the $1.20 mark.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Another notable mover on Friday was chainlink (LINK), which also surged to a multi-month high.
 
LINK/USD jumped to a high of $7.33 earlier in the day, which comes less than a day after falling to a low of $6.93.
 
This rally in price pushed chainlink to its highest point since December 5, breaking it out of a price ceiling in the process.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, LINK climbed past its resistance level of $7.25, however the RSI was unable to also achieve this feat.
 
Price strength is currently at a reading of 64.15, which is marginally below a ceiling at 65.00.

SHIB is one of those tokens that has climbed hard because of its high correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Along with the news of the token’s network upgrade being hyped up, SHIB’s rise is a sure win for investors and traders. 
 

 
However, the token has recently entered a sideways market movement ahead of its Shibarium upgrade. Can Shiba Inu continue its rally or will it experience pain?
