        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Indian Oil Ministry recently acknowledged that the country’s push to pay for oil with rupees has failed because suppliers are not sure if they will be able to repatriate their funds. The decision is intended to help diminish India’s reliance on the U.S. dollar when settling its cross-border obligations. 
 
High Transactional Costs of Converting Rupees
 
The Indian oil ministry recently informed a standing committee of parliament that the country’s attempt to have oil producers accept payment in the local currency has failed. The ministry cites the perceived high cost of converting the rupee to other major currencies as one of the reasons for the policy’s failure.

This hasn’t changed his stance, though, as he made it clear from his comments that he is still critical of the XRP token and its community. 
 
Why This Critic Is Choosing To Buy
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, XRP critic Cousin Crypto mentioned that he was bidding for the crypto token. Such a move will usually not be expected from him, considering his reservations about XRP. However, the crypto trader is choosing not to let his sentiments cloud his judgment as he believes that XRP could pump soon.

“Due to a system issue, the transfer of money to you was inadvertently made twice,” the email noted. “Please note that you are not authorized to receive the second transfer and are legally obligated to return the above amount to the Rehabilitation Trustee.”
