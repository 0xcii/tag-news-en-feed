        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been talks of the likelihood of Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settling in their ongoing legal battle. However, recent comments from Ripple’s President Monica Lang suggest that the company is unlikely to settle with the Commission as it plans on seeing the case “all the way through.”
 
Ripple Not Backing Down
 
Lang told news channel CNBC that her company plans on fighting the SEC’s lawsuit against it till the end. The Ripple president explained that Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling had strengthened the company’s resolve and provided “clarity” by stating that XRP isn’t a security. According to her, this ruling has also opened the door for the company to expand its business not just in the US but “even more globally.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved above the $26,000 level on Wednesday, ahead of the upcoming inflation report in the United States. Consumer prices for August are expected to come in at 3.6%, up from 0.4% the month prior. Core inflation on the other hand is forecasted to fall to 4.3%, from 4.7% in July. Ethereum was back above $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was once again trading above the $26,000 level in today’s session, as markets prepared for the upcoming U.S. inflation report.
 
Following a low of $25,781.12 on Tuesday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak of $26,451.94 earlier in the day.
 
The move comes as the world’s largest cryptocurrency continued to move away from a recent three-month low.

From the chart, Wednesday’s surge in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) jumped past a ceiling of 44.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 47.23, with the next visible point of resistance at the 50.00 mark.
 
In the case that this level is reached, there is a good chance that BTC will be trading closer to $27,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) moved away from Tuesday’s six-month low, climbing back above $1,600 in the process.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,616.54 in today’s session, following a bottom at $1,582.22 less than 24 hours before.
 
As a result of the rebound in price, the RSI has now moved out of oversold territory, and is hovering below a key ceiling.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Currently, the aforementioned resistance sits at 40.00, with price strength currently residing at 39.40.
 
Should this zone be broken, then there will likely be a push above the $1,620 support point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Payment processor Paypal announced it’s introducing on- and off-ramps to facilitate crypto payments for Web3 platforms. Once integrated, merchants in the sector will be able to employ them to expand their user base by connecting to Paypal’s payments system.
 
Paypal Launches On- and Off-Ramps for Web3 Payments
 
Payments giant Paypal revealed on Monday it’s moving to further increase access to crypto by offering wallets, decentralized apps (dapps) and marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) a simple solution to enable their customers to buy and sell supported cryptocurrencies in the U.S.
 
This can be achieved through an integration with the Paypal On and Off Ramps, subject to applicable state laws, the company said, adding:
 

Once integrated, Web3 merchants can help grow their user base by connecting to Paypal’s fast and seamless payments experience trusted by millions, while leveraging Paypal’s robust security controls and tools for fraud management, chargebacks and disputes.
 
 
The fintech firm reminded that it previously launched its on-ramps to enable consumers in the United States to directly buy crypto assets with Paypal through integrations with the Metamask and Ledger wallets.
 
Adding off-ramps will now allow crypto wallet holders in the United States to directly convert cryptocurrencies to U.S. dollars into their Paypal balance and then use the money to shop, send, save, or transfer to their bank or debit card.
 
Paypal’s off-ramps solution is already live on Metamask, the press release noted. Last week, the popular Ethereum wallet introduced a “Sell” option allowing users in the U.S., the U.K., and some European markets to cash out ether (ETH) to major fiat currencies and have the amount sent to a bank account or a Paypal balance.
