So far, over $60 million in crypto is suspected to be already stolen spanning digital assets such as Tron (TRX), Pepe (PEPE), and Magic (MAGIC), among others.
 
Poloniex Crypto Exchange Under Attack
 
The attack was first brought to light by Peckshield which noticed unusual transactions from wallets linked to Poloniex. The blockchain security firm then took to X (formerly Twitter) to point out the transactions to the crypto exchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swiss bank UBS Group AG has now entered the cryptocurrency arena alongside global banking giant HSBC Holdings Plc, enabling wealthy clients in Hong Kong to engage in the trading of specific cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded funds. This strategic decision not only reflects a growing trend among major banks but also underscores Hong Kong’s aspirations to establish itself as a focal point for the flourishing world of digital assets.
 
Significantly, UBS’s Hong Kong platform has now opened doors to three cryptocurrency-linked ETFs, including the Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active and CSOP Bitcoin Futures. This comes after receiving the green light from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), marking a pivotal step in the integration of crypto assets into traditional financial markets.

At first glance, this looks like a positive development if you happen to think crypto adoption is a positive thing. However, on looking at the details of the FCA’s position, it becomes less apparent whether PayPal is being granted meaningful permissions, or whether the permissions on offer serve only to define certain inherent restrictions.
 On top of that, the Bank of England this week released proposals relating to the integration of stablecoin payments through a plan for regulation, which again, looks like a step towards crypto adoption, but with the caveat that terms and conditions apply.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an era where bitcoin transaction fees can soar unexpectedly, managing your unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) is crucial for minimizing costs. Bitcoin users with multiple UTXOs can face hefty fees for future transactions, which depletes the value of their holdings over time. Understanding UTXO consolidation is essential for anyone looking to optimize their bitcoin management strategies.
 
Understanding UTXOs and Their Role in Your Wallet
 
When you receive bitcoin (BTC), the transaction generates UTXOs, which is essentially the “change” that you can spend in future transactions. Each UTXO is an entry in Bitcoin’s ledger, indicating that a certain amount of BTC has not been spent and is available to be sent in a new transaction.

Although Dilkinska was responsible for ensuring that OneCoin complied with the law, she laundered money for the multi-billion dollar crypto scam.

Eri emphasized the importance of contextual analysis, stating, “When you hear people discuss Ripple IPO, comparisons should be made with similar types of companies.” She used the example of Ripple Partner Nium Global, which has postponed its U.S. IPO to possibly the second quarter of 2025.
