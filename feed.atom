the Southern District of New York ordered Ripple to pay $125 million in civil

Judge Reduces SEC Penalty
The fine of $125.035 million is significantly lower than the  
$1 billion in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and the $900 million in  
civil penalties sought by the SEC. 
This decision follows Judge Torres' July 2023 ruling, which

In a new post on X, CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has discussed the latest development in the “Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator” devised by the analytics firm.
 
 
This metric is based on CryptoQuant’s P&L Index, which itself is a unification of a few different popular on-chain indicators related to unrealized and realized profit/loss.
 
The P&L Index basically serves as a way to determine if BTC is in a bear or bull market right now. When the indicator crosses above its 365-day moving average (MA), BTC could be assumed to have entered into a bullish phase. Simil…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a long-awaited conclusion to their high-profile legal clash, Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have reached a settlement that will see the blockchain company pay $125 million in civil penalties.
 
 
Ripple-SEC Legal Saga Ends 
 
According to the court ruling, the key points of the settlement are as follows:
 
 
Ripple will pay $125,035,150 in civil penalties to the SEC, a significant reduction from the regulator’s original $2 billion demand.
 
Ripple was found to have violated securities laws through its “Institutional Sales” of the XRP cryptocurrency, which the court deemed to be unregistered investment contracts.
 
However, the court ruled that Ripple’s “Programmatic Sales” and “Other Distributions” of XRP did not constitute unregistered securities offerings.
 
The court also determined that the individual XRP sales by Ripple co-founders Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse were not investment contract offerings, for “substantially the same reasons” as the Programmatic Sales.
 
 
XRP Price Soars 20%
 
In its analysis, the court noted that while Ripple’s “repeated and lucrative violations of securities laws were a serious offense,” the case did not involve allegations of fraud, misappropriation or other more egregious misconduct. Additionally, the court found that the SEC had not proved that Ripple’s actions caused substantial losses or risk to investors.
 
Ultimately, the settlement marks a significant, if not total, victory for the blockchain payment company, which had fought the SEC’s allegations that XRP was an unregistered security. The company can now move forward without the cloud of legal uncertainty hanging over its business.
 
 
As news of the end of this legal battle unfolded, the price of XRP skyrocketed 20% at the time of writing, trading at $0.6056, after hitting a 1-month low of $0.4315 on Monday amid the broader market crash.
