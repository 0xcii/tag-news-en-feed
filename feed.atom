        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has provided insight into when the altcoin season will likely begin. So far, Bitcoin has continued to lead the way, but that could change soon enough based on Hoskinson’s claim.
 
It Is Officially Altcoin Season When This Happens, Cardano Founder
 
Hoskinson mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that it is officially altcoin season when Dogecoin (DOGE) flips Cardano (ADA). The Cardano founder’s post is significant, considering that ADA and DOGE are going head-to-head, with both tokens presently ranking as the 8th and 9th largest tokens by market cap.

The surge is attributed to increased demand for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), providing a less risky entry into the crypto market. Investors are drawn to bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset, making it appealing for portfolio diversification.
 
Spot bitcoin ETFs offer direct exposure to bitcoin without physical ownership, distinct from traditional ETFs using futures contracts as underlying assets.
 
 
Bitcoin ETFs Soar, Attracting Investors
 
Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced an extraordinary surge in trading volume on Tuesday, collectively reaching an impressive $10 billion.
