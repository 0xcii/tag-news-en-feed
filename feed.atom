Paul Chan, Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary, recently spoke at the Web3 forum in Cyberport, reiterating in October last year that Hong Kong will continue to try converting itself into a global crypto hub.
 
The city remains optimistic despite the FTX fiasco, especially at a time when the industry continued to face the aftermath of the crash. Currently, crypto exchanges can register with the present licensing system, as authorities will soon issue licenses to crypto firms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amongst other updates designed to make new users’ experience easier, a new software update enables wallet funding directly through the application.
Fountain Podcasts, a Lightning-enabled podcast app designed to facilitate value for value transactions, has introduced their 0.6.0 update with many features oriented towards capturing new value for value users. 
In a blog post, Fountain highlighted the new ability to fund your Fountain account via a partnership with MoonPay. Through this partnership, users can now use a debit card or credit card to purchase satoshis which arrive in the app’s wallet shortly thereafter.
The update also brings the arrival of the activity page, a feed which shows popular episodes and clips. The release describes how, “This is just the first of many new social discovery features we will be adding to Fountain that use money as a signal for value.” 
In addition to these larger updates, several UI changes were implemented, including a new content card design, the ability to reply to clips, clips and comments being displayed on the episode pages under Activity and more. 
Through the Fountain app, podcasters can receive sats for the content they provide, while listeners can receive sats for likes on their comments or clips. Streaming your favorite podcaster sats on a minute-by-minute basis provides a direct link between the consumer and the content creator, and is a way to empower these creators using Lightning. 
By facilitating this value for value model, podcasters can avoid external sources of funding. In many industries, but especially in the Bitcoin industry, these external sources can introduce conflicts of interest which can potentially even prove harmful to consumers who trust their favorite podcasters. With software like Fountain, these consumers can directly support these podcasters and reduce the potential for such events.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana surged by as much as 22% on Monday, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. The move saw the token climb to its highest point since November, when it was embroiled in the FTX collapse. Cardano also moved higher to start the week, climbing by nearly 13%.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was one of Monday’s big movers, as prices of the token rose by as much as 22%.
 
SOL/USD surged to an intraday high of $16.62 to start the week, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $13.47.
 
Today’s rise in price pushed SOL to its strongest point since November 12, days after the token plummeted, after being exposed to the FTX/Alameda scandal.
 
 
From the chart, Monday’s rally came following a breakout of a key resistance level at the $15.00 mark.
 
As a result of this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has risen to 73.26, which is its strongest point since April.
 
Due to prices now being relatively overbought, there is a strong possibility that there could be a reversal in momentum in the coming days.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was another notable gainer to start the week, with the token climbing for a second straight day.
 
Following a low of $0.2865 on Sunday, ADA/USD hit a high of $0.3409 earlier in today’s session.
 
Like with solana, this move saw cardano hit its highest mark since November, and came after a breakout of a ceiling at $0.3250.
 
 
Looking at the chart, as a result of today’s rally, the 14-day RSI rose to a level not seen since September 2021.
 
Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, and as of writing, ADA/USD is trading at $0.3247.

The extraordinary events of 2019 through to 2021, which included the COVID-boom of retail investors in crypto, created a crypto gold rush in which proper risk management and operational transparency were overlooked, in favour of riding the wave of positive momentum.

Former FTX US president, Brett Harrison, who after departing from the beleaguered exchange last year, responded to a comment on Twitter indicating that he plans to share information on the crypto exchange’s operations soon. 
 
Harrison To Disclose Information On FTX
 
The former FTX US president’s statement was a response to a curious person’s question asking on Twitter if Harrison knows anything about the exchange’s collapse and when did he know about it. Harrison replied to the question by saying “I’ll share in time.”

The Fed has stated that it aims to bring inflation down to the 2% target, and the increases to the federal funds rate are intended to move toward this goal. However, Zoltan Pozsar, a U.S. macroeconomist and observer of the Fed, predicts that the central bank will start quantitative easing (QE) again by summer. Bill Baruch, an executive at Blue Line Futures, a futures and commodities brokerage firm, anticipates that the Fed will halt rate hikes by February.
