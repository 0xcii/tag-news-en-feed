On Friday, China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS) announced the successful extradition of Zhang Moumou from Thailand as part of the “Operation Fox Hunt.” The operation was a collaborative effort between the Chinese embassy in Thailand, Thai authorities, the MPS, and relevant domestic departments to successfully deport the suspected criminal back to China.

These metrics, which often serve as indicators of future price movements, paint a picture of growing optimism in the market. One of the key indicators supporting this positive outlook is the exchange inflow/outflow data, which reveals a shift in sentiment toward Bitcoin. 
 
Despite some notable large-scale Bitcoin transfers by the defunct exchange Mt. Gox and significant movements by miners to over-the-counter (OTC) desks, the overall inflow of Bitcoin into crypto exchanges has sharply declined in the past few days.

CZ Shifted To Long Beach Facility
 
Contrary to the circulating rumors, Zhao has not been entirely freed from incarceration. Instead, he has been transferred to an administrative facility in the Greater Los Angeles area just 38 days before his scheduled release from custody.

Four years after the fondly remembered DeFi summer of 2020, the total value locked (TVL) in protocols can hit an all-time high by early next year.
 
However, the return of DeFi summer rests on two key factors.
 
Lower Ethereum Fees Crucial To Attract Investors
 
Ethereum (ETH) has historically led the DeFi wave, boasting the highest TVL locked into its protocols among all other smart-contract blockchains. According to DeFiLlama, the TVL locked in Ethereum-based protocols currently stands at approximately $50.11 billion.

BTC prices are inside a narrow range, with support at around $56,000 on the lower end and a stubborn liquidation level at $63,000.
 
Even though the uptrend remains, at least considering the state of price action in the past few trading days, conservative and risk-on traders are now on the sidelines. 
 
It is only when there is a clear trend definition, either below $50,000 or above $72,000, that traders can commit. The result will be an uptick in trading volume, currently muted and way below the averages recorded on August 8.
