        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bankman-Fried,  
the founder of FTX, has faced another legal setback as an appeals court  
rejected his attempt to secure pre-trial release ahead of his upcoming trial  
scheduled for October 3rd. This decision comes after a series of legal  
challenges and controversies surrounding the crypto entrepreneur.
Bankman-Fried  
Faces Legal Setback as Trial Approaches
In  
August, Bankman-Fried's release on bond was revoked by a judge who ruled that  
he had allegedly attempted to tamper with witnesses in his ongoing legal case.  
Earlier this month, his request to overturn this decision was also denied, and  
yesterday, an appeals court upheld that denial.
The  
appeals court stated their decision: "We reject [Bankman-Fried’s]  
contention that the district court failed to consider a less restr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Shibarium network has recently weathered a turbulent month. This rollercoaster ride has had a significant impact on two closely related tokens: SHIB and BONE. Both tokens have been experiencing extreme volatility in the crypto market, with sentiment and data surrounding Shibarium constantly shifting.
 
One of the key indicators reflecting the network’s recent challenges is the total value locked (TVL). On August 29, the TVL for Shibarium stood at a substantial $1.47 million. However, as of September 20, the TVL has plummeted to $630,012, highlighting a notable decline in liquidity and assets within the network. 
 
This dip in TVL has raised concerns among investors and observers alike, as it suggests a significant loss of confidence in the ecosystem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a new update from the Mt Gox trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, the repayment deadline for creditors has been pushed to next year. Kobayashi said discussions with banks, fund transfer service providers and designated cryptocurrency exchanges have caused delays, making it impossible to meet the original repayment deadline.
 
Mt Gox Trustee Delays Payments
 

 
Nobuaki Kobayashi, the Mt Gox trustee in charge of the funds owed to the exchange’s creditors, updated the public on September 21, 2023. According to the trustee, because of lengthy discussions with specific payment providers, Kobayashi could not make the October 31, 2023 deadline. Because of this reason, the repayments will start next year.
 

 
“Therefore, with the permission of the Tokyo District Court, the rehabilitation trustee has changed the deadline of the base repayment, the early lump-sum repayment, and the intermediate repayment from October 31, 2023 (Japan Time) to October 31, 2024 (Japan Time), respectively,” the letter from Kobayashi details.
 

 

 

 
Mt Gox creditors have waited nine years for payments. Currently, they are owed 141,686 BTC, 142,846 BCH, and 69,776,002,441 yen. Though the delay has been extended, creditors who have completed their claims might receive a payment by year’s end.
 

 
“Rehabilitation creditors who have provided the necessary information to the rehabilitation trustee will see repayments made in sequence as early as the end of this year,” the letter stated. However, this schedule could change. Kobayashi also said that due to a “high volume of inquiries” regarding the process, the rehabilitation team might not respond promptly.

Stark compares the meteoric rise and subsequent fall of NFTs to the infamous fad of pet rocks in the 1970s. Drawing attention to a new study’s findings, he asserts that most NFT collections have rapidly lost value, leaving investors with little to show for their purchases. 
 
Stark argues that fractionalized links to the metadata of JPEG files, which form the basis of NFTs, are essentially a con game. He claims that the NFT marketplace is inorganic and “rigged,” with rampant market manipulation and fraud …]]></summary>
