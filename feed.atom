        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Charles Gasparino of Fox Business, financial firms feel confident that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is going to rule in favor of approving spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) after January 8, 2024.



Gasparino's post also stated that shares the of Bitcoin ETFs will only be available to purchase with cash, rather than also with bitcoin. As the regulator is "worried about ETF's being used as a vehicle for money laundering." Over the course of the past few weeks, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers like BlackRock have been meeting with the SEC to discuss the final details of their ETFs. There was one topic in particular that the regulator was meeting with issuers about, and that was in-kind vs in-cash creations for shares of the ETFs.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Grown Throughout 2023
 
In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how the supplies of Bitcoin long-term holders and short-term holders have changed over the year 2023.
 
These two investor groups make up the two main divisions of the BTC sector. The short-term holders (STHs) are the participants who bought within the last 155 days, while the long-term holders (LTHs) are those who have held longer than that.

One of the most important use cases of Bitcoin is, as many users of a certain privacy wallet would say, “To make the transactions they don’t want you to make.” Censorship resistance. Financial institutions, and indirectly governments through the coercive influence they exert over those institutions, hold a large degree of control over society and the economy by having the ability to deny people access to financial services and the ability to transact in markets they deem unacceptable.
