        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VanEck, a prominent investment management firm, has unveiled a interesting new Bitcoin commercial, stirring excitement and speculation within the Bitcoin community. The release comes amidst mounting anticipation surrounding the possible approval of Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The commercial, showcases a high-quality production recorded at PubKey, a Bitcoin bar in New York City. "All Bitcoiners in NYC need to make the pilgrimage to PubKey if they haven’t checked it out yet," VanEck said.



This move by VanEck appears to be a prelude to the imminent decision on the much-anticipated Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Industry analysts interpret this release as an attempt to not only capture public attention but also to bolster confidence in Bitcoin-related financial products.
The commercial’s timing aligns with VanEck's continued efforts to secure regulatory approval for a Bitcoin ETF, signaling their readiness to enter the market should approval be granted. The SEC has been under increasing pressure to greenlight a Spot Bitcoin ETF, which would open the door for institutional and more retail investors to access Bitcoin exposure via traditional investment avenues.
As the Bitcoin community eagerly awaits the SEC’s decision, VanEck’s bold marketing move has ignited conversations, fueling optimism about the integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial services. The commercial aims to resonate with both seasoned Bitcoin enthusiasts and newcomers, emphasizing the potential significance of BTC in reshaping global finance.]]></summary>

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Been Positive Recently
 
As explained by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the Coinbase Premium Gap has been leading the BTC price during the recent price range.
 
The “Coinbase Premium Gap” is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance.
 
 
Coinbase is known to host more US-based traffic (with large institutional investors especially preferring the platform), while Binance receives a global audience. As such, the metric’s value can provide hints about the difference between the buying or selling …]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-12-29T16:37:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pancakeswap community has sanctioned a governance vote to eliminate 300 million CAKE tokens from the crypto asset’s total supply. Records indicate that a substantial 97.88% of community votes supported the reduction of 300 million CAKE, decreasing the total supply from 750 million to 450 million CAKE tokens. 
 
Near-Unanimous Vote Cuts CAKE Supply
 
On Dec. 21, 2023, the Pancakeswap community received a governance proposal to deduct 300 million CAKE tokens from the total crypto asset supply. Voting commenced on Thursday and concluded on Friday, Dec. 29, 2023, culminating in the community’s endorsement of the supply cut.
 
A resounding 97.88% of the community voted in favor of the proposal, with a mere 2.12% opposing it. The action will reduce the supply from 750 million CAKE to 450 million. “With a current circulating supply of 388M CAKE, the Kitchen believes this new and lower cap will be sufficient to gain market share across all chains and sustain the VECAKE model,” stated the original proposal.
 
Following the governance vote, Pancakeswap’s CAKE surged 42.6% against the U.S. dollar over the previous week and achieved an over 62% increase for the month. Nonetheless, CAKE experienced a slight dip of about 2.4% against the greenback in the past day. Currently, CAKE boasts a market capitalization of $872 million, representing 0.05% of the total $1.75 trillion crypto economy.
 
 
Currently standing as the third-largest decentralized exchange (dex) globally by volume, Pancakeswap holds $1.66 billion in total value locked (TVL) within the protocol. The dex platform has seen a 16.81% increase over the past month. Despite a monthly surge of 62% in CAKE, the dex platform’s native crypto is still trading 91.80% below its all-time high of $43.96 per coin set on April 30, 2021. As of today, CAKE’s 24-hour intraday trading range has fluctuated between $3.49 and $3.83 per unit.

In anticipation, traditional financial institutions also applied to issue spot Ether ETFs. Since applicants like BlackRock have a near-perfect track record in obtaining SEC approval for their ETFs, spot Ether ETFs are likely to be approved, too. However, the SEC might approve them only after their Bitcoin counterparts, which would mean approval of Ether ETFs in late 2024 or early 2025. 
If approved, spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs will attract millions of new investors who were previously unable or unwilling to purchase crypto assets directly. Will Bitcoin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino made a retrospective about the company’s growth since its beginnings. In a post in X, Ardoino celebrated the current standing of the company, with its USDT stablecoin reaching a $91.5 billion market cap on several blockchains, $4 billion in excess reserves, and a portfolio of mining, energy, and artificial intelligence (AI) investments.
Paolo Ardoino Celebrates Tether
Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, the company behind the issuance of USDT, remarked on the evolution of the company, noting the size and significance it has reached for “millions of people,” especially in emerging markets and developing countries.
Making an emphasis on the growth of the company and its change in recent years, Ardoino stated:
Tether evolved. We listened to our community, we learned and improved. It’s a process. Always will be. No company has the luxury to exist without challenges. But the team kept its focus. Through the fire and the flames, we carry on.
Ardoino also praised USDT reaching $95.4 billion in market cap, becoming the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, with $4 billion in excess reserves that are separated from the actual reserves backing the USDT available on the market.
Tether has not sat idle over these earnings, though, as it has slowly invested in several initiatives involving mining, energy renewables, development platforms, and artificial intelligence (AI). Ardoino mentioned Holepunch, Synonim, Northern Data, and Tether Energy, highlighting the company’s expansion into different fields to keep growing and expanding.
The company has also recently reinforced its compromise in the compliance area, revealing the tight integration with U.S. government agencies like the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Finally, Ardoino revealed Tether’s plans to develop new products for 2024 and consolidate the existing ones. “They will be mind-blowing,” he concluded.
