        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is generally understood that bitcoin and other cryptos can be addicting. Consequently, as with any chemicals that get many people hooked, excessive usage can be detrimental to mental health.
 
For instance, losing large sums of money seemingly suddenly and feeling helpless can unavoidably cause stress levels to rise and affect your self-esteem. Worse, it can ruin your outlook on life.
 
People may turn to alternative addictive substances to deal with these difficulties. So begins a pattern that can result in addiction, anxiety, depression, among other harmful things.
 
Rehab centers that treat bitcoin addiction are on the rise around the world, providing services for those with crypto exhaustion and other related “sickness.”

After BTC reached a new 5-month high of $24,241 last Wednesday, the price is on the decline again. Over the weekend, Bitcoin lost another 3% and was at $22,810 as of press time.
 
Initially, the price was propelled higher last week by the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points and dovish comments from Jerome Powell, before a major damper came on Friday.
 
According to the latest figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy saw a sensational 517,000 new job growth last month – a sign that the Fed is likely to keep interest rates high for longer.
