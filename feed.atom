Following its request for emergency bailout funding, popular crypto lender Genesis has slashed its staff members and is now considering a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.

Is Genesis Really Going Down?

It’s the latest federal pursuit of crypto rugpullers, an endeavor that is relatively new for federal bodies when it comes to NFTs.
