U.S. SEC Fails to Appeal Court Decision on Grayscale’s Application for Spot Bitcoin ETF
 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not appealed a court decision in favor of Grayscale’s bid to convert its bitcoin trust (GBTC) to a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The crypto asset manager had challenged the SEC’s move to deny the conversion. The regulator had 45 days to file an appeal and hasn’t done so at the time…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-shib-hits-6-day-high-to-start-the-weekend/"/>
        <updated>2023-10-14T13:40:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturday saw shiba inu climb to its highest point since Monday, as bulls made a slight return to the market. The meme coin rose by as much as 4% on Saturday, as the global crypto market cap made gradual gains to start the weekend. Solana was another notable mover, climbing above the $22.00 zone.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) rallied for a third straight session on Saturday, as the meme coin jumped nearly 4% higher in the day.
 
Following a low of $0.000006828 on Friday, SHIB/USD climbed to a peak of $0.000007099 to start the weekend.
 
This is the highest point that SHIB has hit since Monday, when price was trading at a high of $0.00000721.
 
 
The rally started after bulls rejected a breakout of a floor at $0.00000670 earlier this week, and they now look to be taking the coin to a resistance level of $0.00000760.
 
From the chart, it appears that the surge has resulted in the relative strength index (RSI) moving above its own ceiling at 45.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is at a reading of 46.39, with the next visible point of resistance at 51.00.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) extended its own gains to start the weekend, as the cryptocurrency finally rose above $22.00.
 
SOL/USD peaked at $22.20 earlier in today’s session, which comes following Friday’s low at the $21.39 level.
 
Earlier gains have since eased as the day matured, which came after bulls began to close previous positions.
 
 
One reason for this can be attributed to the RSI, which collided with a ceiling around the 53.00 region.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 53.02, with solana trading at $21.92, as momentum begins to shift.

Citadel May Have Caused UST Depeg
 
In the court filing dated October 10, Terraform Labs, the company that developed the Terra blockchain and supported the UST stablecoin, alleged that UST’s collapse wasn’t caused by any instability in the token’s ecosystem but by the “concerted, intentional effort of certain third party market participants” who shorted and caused the token to de-peg from its dollar price.

        <updated>2023-10-14T12:20:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin retreated from a brief spell above $27,000 on Saturday, as uncertainty in the market remained high to start the weekend. The global cryptocurrency market was marginally higher to start the weekend, trading 0.42% higher as of writing. Ethereum continued to consolidate above a recent floor of $1,535.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) retreated below the $27,000 level to start the weekend, after a late surge in price on Friday.
 
Following a low of $26,686.32 earlier in Friday’s session, BTC/USD peaked at a high of $27,092.70 as the day progressed.
 
Although BTC has since slipped, and is currently trading at $26,866.74, it is still higher than yesterday’s bottom.
 
 
The consolidation comes as the relative strength index (RSI) continues to hover above a floor at the 45.00 mark.
 
Whilst now tracking at 46.72, the next target is likely to be at a ceiling of 50.00, and if hit, bitcoin will be back above $27,000.
 
Overall, bitcoin is trading 4% lower than at the same point last week.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) is largely unchanged at the time of writing, as the cryptocurrency consolidated to start the weekend.
 
ETH/USD reached a high of $1,571.75 on Friday, however has since fallen to a current reading of $1,546.80.
 
This is slightly higher than yesterday’s low at $1,538.09, which was marginally above a support point at $1,535.
 
 
The drop in price coincides with the RSI failing to breach its own point of resistance at the 40.00 mark.
 
Currently, price strength is at the 37.46 level, with the 10-day moving average continuing to trend downwards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly decided not to appeal the recent court’s decision regarding a case between the federal securities regulator and Grayscale Investments. 
 
In a high-profile ruling on August 29, the US District of Columbia Court of Appeals granted the prominent asset manager’s request to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) following an initial denial by the SEC.
 
While there may have been speculations about the US regulator potentially mounting a challenge to this ruling, a Friday report by Reuters states that the SEC would not be taking that route, according to a source close to the matter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided not to appeal a recent court decision favoring Grayscale Investments' Bitcoin ETF conversion plans, according to a report by Reuters. The decision, which comes after a legal battle and months of anticipation, may signal a shift in the regulatory landscape towards the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC.
The decision, according to a confidential source close to the matter, was made internally at the SEC, following a federal court's verdict allowing Grayscale to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. This decision by the SEC not to pursue an appeal marks a significant milestone in the ongoing effort to introduce a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund to the U.S. market.
Grayscale's victory in court was seen as a crucial test case, as it could potentially set a precedent for other spot Bitcoin ETF applicants seeking to convert their products into ETFs. The move towards a Bitcoin ETF has been highly anticipated in the space, as it could provide institutional investors with an easier way to gain exposure to BTC.
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is currently one of the most popular investment vehicles for exposure to Bitcoin, but its structure differs significantly from a traditional ETF. A successful conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF would simplify the investment process and make it more accessible to a broader range of investors.
While the SEC's decision not to appeal is being celebrated by many in the Bitcoin community, it's worth noting that this does not equate to full approval of Grayscale's conversion proposal. The regulatory body will continue to evaluate the proposal within its existing processes, ensuring that it complies with securities laws and investor protection standards.]]></summary>
