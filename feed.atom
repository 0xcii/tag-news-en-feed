        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Veteran Bitcoin Magazine reporter and Bitcoin Magazine Print Lead Mark Goodwin has been named Bitcoin Magazine’s newest Editor in Chief.
Joining the Bitcoin Magazine team in 2021 as an opinion columnist and contributor, Goodwin has been instrumental in charting editorial decisions for Bitcoin Magazine’s quarterly Print magazine, relaunched in 2021, and which today reaches thousands of readers globally. 
As part of the announcement, Goodwin will be expanding his editorial remit to include Bitcoin Magazine’s digital publications and social channels. 
“Mark has emerged as a leader in the Bitcoin newsroom who has shown he is willing and ready to navigate the complexity of Bitcoin and to deal with its rough-and-tumble enthusiasts,” said Mike Germano, publisher of Bitcoin Magazine. “We feel Mark is uniquely positioned to help Bitcoin Magazine balance the challenge of appealing to our new and veteran readers.” 
Mark is distinguished through his writing on stablecoins and the U.S. dollar system, culminating in his upcoming book The Bitcoin-Dollar, his coverage of the Ordinals protocol, mention of which was made in the Q2 2022 print Bitcoin Magazine, as well as his work to involve and engage the Julian Assange estate in the most recent Q1 2023 The Gatekeepers Issue, now on newsstands. 
“This is a responsibility I take on with great humility and excitement,” said Goodwin. “Bitcoin, the Bitcoin community, and Bitcoin Magazine have all drastically changed the course of my life, and I look forward to serving and honoring that which has given so much to me.”
For editorial submissions or comments Mark can be reached on Twitter here or via email at mark.goodwin@btcmedia.org.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia announced it will continue limiting oil production through September, extending output reductions that have drawn criticism from Washington.
 
Riyadh Holds Firm on Oil Output Limits
 
Saudi Arabia said Thursday it will keep oil production nearly one million barrels per day below its quota for another month, according to a statement from the Saudi Ministry of Energy reported by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.
 
The voluntary supply restraint, which began in July alongside Russia’s 300,000 barrel per day cut, aims to prop up oil prices amid concerns over slowing economic growth. But prior decisions like this one have frustrated U.S. officials who have urged producers to raise output to lower fuel costs.

Litecoin Whale Deposits Big To Binance As LTC Suffers Post-Halving Plunge
 
Yesterday, Litecoin finally completed its much-talked-about third halving event, meaning that the cryptocurrency’s block rewards have once again been halved from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC.
 
While the event had some hype behind it, it turned out to be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” type of deal in the end, as the asset’s price has taken a notable hit since the event has taken place.
 
At the time of the halving, LTC was floating around $91, but after the selloff, the coin dropped to $86, which suggests a plunge greater than 5%.

        <updated>2023-08-03T15:48:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was one of Thursday’s notable movers, as the token dropped to a multi-week low in today’s session. The decline comes as the global market cap fell by as much as 2% over the course of the day. Dogecoin also declined, falling for a third consecutive session.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, remained in the red during today’s session, as the price fell to a multi-week low.
 
Following a high of $0.6971 the day prior, XRP/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.6589 earlier in the day.
 
This is the weakest point that XRP has hit since July 13, when the token was trading below $0.4700.
 
 
That day also saw XRP hit its highest point since December 2021, after it was ruled by a U.S. judge not necessarily to be a security.
 
Since then, sentiment has been largely bearish, with the latest sell-off coming as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a floor at 49.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 48.60, with the next visible point of support at 45.00.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) extended its own stay in bearish territory on Thursday, as the meme coin fell by as much as 5% today.
 
The decline saw DOGE/USD drop to an intraday low at $0.07305, less than 24 hours after peaking at $0.07703.
 
As a result of this sell-off, dogecoin has fallen to its lowest level since July 24, which is the last time price was trading at a support of $0.07000.
 
 
Similar to XRP above, Thursday’s decline comes as a result of price strength falling below a floor at 51.00.
 
The RSI is currently at a reading of 50.23, with DOGE trading at $0.07339, which is marginally above today’s bottom.
