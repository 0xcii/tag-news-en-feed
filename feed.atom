        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tether’s USDT, the largest crypto stablecoin, recently celebrated its 10th year in the industry. The company’s growth has been impressive, thanks to its steady user base, holdings that include $97 billion in US government bonds, and its plans to partner with US law enforcement agencies to strengthen its brand.
 
 
Now, the team behind Tether can find another reason to celebrate: data suggest that Tether’s USDT user growth recorded its best quarter in Q3 by adding 36.25 million new users. The company added that its quarterly user data has increased by 9% on average over the last 12 months, giving it enough cushion as it expands its use cases and applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a new blog post titled “Possible futures for the Ethereum protocol, part 2: The Surge,” Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin outlined an ambitious roadmap aiming to scale Ethereum’s transaction processing capacity to over 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) across Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) solutions. This initiative, known as “The Surge,” seeks to enhance scalability while preserving decentralization and security.
 
Buterin began by reflecting on Ethereum’s initial scaling strategies, which involved sharding and Layer 2 protocols like state channels and Plasma. At the beginning, Ethereum had two scaling strategies in its roadmap, he wrote, pointing to a 2015 paper that discussed sharding—a method where each node only needs to verify and store a fraction of the transactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Venture capital investment in the crypto sector declined in the third quarter of 2024, following a persistent  
downtrend that began earlier this year. However, while overall numbers were  
down, early-stage startups in AI and blockchain infrastructure obtained most of the investments.
According to a report by Galaxy, the total venture capital investment in crypto  
and blockchain-focused startups reached $2.4 billion in Q3 2024, a 20% decline  
from the previous quarter. Similarly, the number of deals fell by 17%,  
with 478 deals completed.
Venture Capital Investments
This dip in activity is partly due to the ongoing  
sluggishness in the broader crypto market, which has been stuck in a  
"barbell" situation, Bitcoin on one end and meme coins on the other,

Dogecoin price, a fan favourite, is expected to rally to $1 before December. Shiba Inu (SHIB), however, could shoot up to $0.0005. But perhaps the most shocking of them all is ETFSwap (ETFS), an Ethereum token, which could rise from $0.03846 To $35. 
 
ETFSwap (ETFS) Shows Promising Signs Of Long-term Prospects And Sustainability 
The core feature of ETFSwap (ETFS) lies in its ability to tokenize Spot ETFs. By tokenizing real-world assets, including gold, oil, and corn, ETFSwap (ETFS) taps into the massive ETF market and serves as a bridge linking both traditional ETFs and cryptocurrency-focused ETFs.

Why The Dogecoin Price Rallied By Over 7%
 
The Dogecoin price rallied by over 7% following Musk’s tweet, in which he alluded to ‘D.O.G.E.’ Musk simply said in his post, “D.O.G.E will fix it,” in response to another post asserting that politicians and bureaucrats are the greatest threat to human progress and flourishing.

Hayes believes more borrowing will ensue with increasing military spending and that this borrowing will be serviced by more balance sheet expansion by the Federal Reserve and commercial banks, all ultimately to the detriment of the US dollar.
