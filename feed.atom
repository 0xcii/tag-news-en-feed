        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent findings from BitMEX Research have reignited concerns about the centralization of Bitcoin mining. Their study, which cites insights from Bitcoin analyst Alex Bergeron, points out that a single entity now controls the Coinbase outputs for approximately 47% of the network hashrate—a significant concentration that suggests a shift toward oligopolistic tendencies within the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.
 
Bergeron, who has previously addressed issues of centralization, highlights that this trend may be driven by mining pools altering their payout schemes to reduce variance. This adjustment makes such pools more attractive and competitively dominant. Bergeron’s observations are supported by data from @mononautical on Twitter, showing that prominent mining pools like AntPool, F2Pool, and Bina…]]></summary>

The equations, which defied basic arithmetic (think 2 + 2 = 0), left many scratching their heads and fearing a break in the very fabric of mathematics.
 
However, as it turns out, Buterin wasn’t having a mathematical meltdown; he was introducing a revolutionary new concept called Binius.

The agency’s filing asserts that the testimony is permissible as summary evidence under federal law, not requiring expert disclosure as claimed by Ripple.
 
The SEC’s motion, directed to Judge Sarah Netburn, underscores that the Fox Declaration is a “standard summary evidence permissible under Fed. R. Evid. 1006,” which aims to aid the court by providing straightforward arithmetic calculations based on Ripple’s financial records. The SEC’s motion states that “It is not an expert’s report, does not rely on specialized expertise, and does not render any opinions at all, let alone an ‘expert’ one.”
