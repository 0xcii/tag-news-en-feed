Over the past five days, Credit Suisse shares have fallen 24.34% against the U.S. dollar, eroding trust amid fears about the global banking system. On Wednesday at around 9 p.m. (ET), Credit Suisse announced that it was strengthening its liquidity by borrowing 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank (SNB). As concerns about the world’s banking system continue to spread, bailout measures are starting to emerge in the U.S. and abroad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin and shiba inu fell by as much as 5% in today’s session, as markets reacted to the European Central Bank (ECB) rate hike. The bank moved to increase rates by 50 basis points, despite the recent banking crisis. As a result of this many now expect that the Federal Reserve will continue to increase rates also.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) fell by over 5% on Thursday, as markets reacted to the latest interest rate decision from the ECB.
 
Many believe the Federal Reserve could take a similar approach, hiking rates despite the recent turmoil within the banking system.
 
Following a high of $0.07313, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday low of $0.06814 earlier in today’s session.
 
 
As a result of the decline, DOGE was once again trading below a key price floor at the $0.07000 mark.
 
The decline comes as bears snapped a five-day win streak on Wednesday, with some of this sentiment carrying over to today.
 
The catalyst for this appears to be a failed breakout of the ceiling at the 44.00 level on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
In addition to DOGE, shiba inu (SHIB) was also in the red in today’s session, with prices trading close to a key price floor.
 
SHIB/USD slipped to a low of $0.00001024 earlier in the day, which comes a day after hitting a high of $0.00001098.
 
Thursday’s drop in price has seen the meme coin close in on a long-term support point at the $0.00001020 mark.
 
 
However, a collision was averted, as the RSI bounced from a floor of its own, at the 38.00 zone.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 39.13, with an interim resistance at 41.00 a possible target.
 
Shiba inu has now marginally recovered from earlier lows, and as of writing, is trading at $0.00001049.
