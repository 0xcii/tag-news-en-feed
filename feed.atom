        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent data indicates that the market capitalization of the newly introduced stablecoin, first digital usd (FDUSD), is approaching the $1 billion threshold. This growth, a 253% increase in supply, has been recorded since August 4, 2023. Currently, the circulation of FDUSD tokens stands at 921 million. 
 
FDUSD’s Market Value Climbs Toward $1 Billion in Just 120 Days
 
Since its inception, FDUSD’s market value is on the brink of reaching $1 billion, having expanded its supply by a substantial 253% over the past 120 days from August 4, 2023. To date, the issuer of FDUSD has released three attestations, with the latest monthly report concluding in October. As of December 2, 2023, the circulation of first digital usd (FDUSD) stands at approximately 921,272,192 tokens.
 

 
Of the 921 million FDUSD in existence, a mere 224 holders possess the stablecoin, which has been transacted onchain only 1,471 times. Dominating the FDUSD landscape, Binance holds the top three addresses. The leading address alone accounts for a staggering 90.96% of FDUSD’s total supply. Following closely, Binance‘s second wallet contains 7.65% of the circulating FDUSD. The third wallet, also under Binance’s control, holds 0.81%.
 
Wintermute owns the fourth-largest FDUSD wallet, comprising 0.16% of the total supply, equivalent to 1,502,179 FDUSD. The fifth-largest wallet, whose owner remains unidentified, controls 999,998 FDUSD, or 0.10% of the supply. Collectively, the top 100 holders own 921,269,821.68 FDUSD tokens, nearly the entire circulation.
 
 
FDUSD’s rising prominence has positioned it as the sixth-largest USD-pegged token by market capitalization. While it closely trails behind BUSD, TUSD, and DAI, FDUSD is considerably smaller compared to giants like USDC and USDT. However, it boasts a larger supply than newer entrants like Paypal’s PYUSD, Tron’s USDD, and Gemini’s GUSD stablecoin.

2020 Had the Highest Failure Rate
 
According to a new analysis by Coingecko, between 2018 and 2023, 2,127 out of 2,817 Web3 games launched have either failed or are now inactive. This means that for every four games launched, three have disappeared. Coingecko’s analysis also shows that during this period, the number of Web3 games that failed averaged 80.8% each year.
 

 
As per Coingecko’s data, the failure rate during the five years was the highest in 2019 (94.3%) and 2020 (94.4%). However, in 2021, the year of the last crypto bull run, 339 out of 738 games failed, translating to a failure rate of 45.9%.
 
 
In terms of the actual number of failed games, Coingecko’s analysis identifies 2022 as the year with the highest number of dead games with 742. The failure rate in that year stood at 107.1%, meaning it was the only year when the number of failed games was higher than those launched (693).
 
Meanwhile, the analysis shows that 2023 has the second-highest number of games launched (720), while 2020’s 86 game launches are the least in each of the five years reviewed. The year 2020 recorded the lowest number of dead games in any of the five years with 81.
