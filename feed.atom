Van de Poppe mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that altcoins are ready for their upward run and will see a lot of momentum from late June until September or October. The crypto analyst added that these altcoins will reprice back to their normal values when this move occurs, alluding to the “big cascade” they have suffered since the start of the year.
