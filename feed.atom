        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rewards company Fold has announced its expansion into El Salvador, establishing a new office that will serve as its base for operations in Latin America. Fold, known for introducing the world's first bitcoin rewards Visa Debit Card to the U.S. market in 2020, aims to make bitcoin accessible and easy for users worldwide.
Fold CEO Will Reeves expressed enthusiasm about the move in a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine, stating, "As a country that has embraced bitcoin and has been a pioneer in adopting new monetary technology, we believe that El Salvador is the perfect place for Fold to expand its presence in Latin America." Reeves sees El Salvador as an ideal location due to the country's positive stance on bitcoin and its efforts to build new capital markets.
According to the release, Fold's expansion will bring valuable solutions to consumers and businesses in the region through its rewards program and embedded bitcoin infrastructure. The company stated its plans to announce partnerships with major players in Latin America soon. According to the release, to date, Fold's bitcoin rewards infrastructure has processed over $1 billion in volume, highlighting its growing success and impact.
Stacy Herbert, from the National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador, expressed excitement about Fold's arrival, stating, "Fold certainly fits that description and we are excited to welcome them to Bitcoin Country." Fold's expansion into El Salvador marks a significant milestone for the company as it continues to foster a global bitcoin community.
The new office in El Salvador and the local team will enable Fold to provide personalized support to its Latin American users and partners. The Fold mobile app is available for download on Android and iOS devices.
For more information on Fold's expansion and upcoming partnerships, the company encouraged users to visit their website at www.foldapp.com.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana extended recent gains on Monday, as the token rose to a one-week high, following recent declines. The token dropped below the $20.00 level last week, as a red wave hit cryptocurrency markets. Litecoin was also higher today, climbing by nearly 7%.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rose to a one-week high on Monday, as momentum shifted following a recent bear run.
 
SOL/USD surged to a peak of $21.49 earlier in today’s session., which comes after Sunday’s low of $20.65.
 
As a result of this rally, solana moved to its strongest point since last Monday, when price was close to $22.00.
 
 
One of the catalysts of today’s gains came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 45.00.
 
The index is now tracking at 48.31, which is its highest reading in almost ten days of trading.
 
Should current sentiment extend throughout the week, there is a good chance SOL will near its long-term resistance at $24.00.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Additionally, litecoin (LTC) also moved higher in today’s session, with price climbing by as much as 7%.
 
Following a low of $81.75 on Sunday, LTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $87.54 earlier in the day.
 
This jump resulted in the token reaching its highest point since March 6, which is the last time LTC was trading close to the $90.00 mark.
 
 
From the chart, a breakout of the RSI has also occurred here, with a ceiling at 51.00 being broken.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now at the 54.15 mark, with the next visible point of resistance being 58.00.
 
There is a strong possibility that litecoin could move above $90.00 in the coming days.

As public trust in institutions weakens, governments around the world are gearing up for

If you follow U.S. politics, you understand that the country is on the brink of defaulting on its massive $31 trillion debt. 
At the crux of the issue is that there are Republicans in one corner, who control the House of Representatives with a slim 222 to 213 majority. In the other corner, the U.S. Senate and the White House, under Joe Biden, are controlled by Democrats.
Both parties are diametrically opposed to what the other wants. Republicans want to significantly cut spending in order to raise the debt limit for a year. Democrats want a “clean” debt ceiling bill passed without strings attached. As you can see, both parties’ starting positions are nowhere near each other. Ultimately, this has turned…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was back in the green on Monday, as prices climbed back above the $27,000 level to start the week. Prices slipped to a two-month low over the weekend, however momentum has marginally shifted. Ethereum was also higher today. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) jumped back above the $27,000 level to start the week, as sentiment showed glimpses of shifting after last week’s bear run.
 
Following a low of $26,762.25 on Sunday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $27,521.62 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency continue to move away from a floor at $26,500, and a recent two-month low.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Monday’s rise in price sees bitcoin move higher for a second straight day, breaking out of a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI) in the process.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 43.66, which is marginally above the aforementioned resistance at 43.00.
 
Bulls will now likely be looking to reenter the $28,000 level, which was last hit this past Thursday.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also made gains to start the week, as it moved beyond the $1,800 mark in today’s session.
 
ETH/USD rose to a high of $1,834.94 on Monday, less than 24 hours after falling to a bottom at $1,787.54.
 
Similar to BTC, today’s move is the second consecutive day ETH has risen, and comes following the recent eight-day losing streak.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This resulted in ethereum dropping to its weakest point since March, however it now appears that momentum has now shifted.
 
Price strength on ethereum has also risen, climbing above a key point of resistance at the 44.00 level.
 
The index is now tracking at the 45.85 mark, with the next ceiling at the 50.00 level.
