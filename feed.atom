        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chiliz (CHZ), the digital currency powering the sports fan engagement platform Socios.com, is stirring excitement in the crypto market with a potent combination of bullish technical indicators and a recent breakout from a downtrend.
 
 
CHZ Primed For Growth
 
CHZ has been on a steady climb over the medium to long term, reflecting a growing sense of optimism among investors. This positive sentiment is further amplified by the token’s approach to a critical resistance level of $0.16. A successful breach of this barrier could trigger a wave of buying activity, propelling CHZ to significantly higher price points.
 
Adding fuel to the fire, trading volume patterns are exhibiting a bullish bias. The presence of higher trading volume during price increases suggests robust underlying demand for C…]]></summary>

SHIB’s Burn Rate Declines By 97%
 
Data from the burn tracking website Shibburn shows that Shiba Inu’s burn rate has declined by over 97% in the last 24 hours, with only 128,791 SHIB tokens burned during this period. These burns occurred in just two transactions, with 100,000 Shiba Inu tokens burned in one transaction and 28,791 burned in the second transaction. 
 
 
This is in stark contrast to the day before when over 4.5 million SHIB tokens were burned. However, the bigger picture shows that Shiba Inu’s burn rate has been on the decline for a while now.…]]></summary>

In his analysis, Peter Brandt suggests Bitcoin could gallop towards a record-breaking peak of $130,000 to $150,000 by late summer 2025.
 
Brandt’s forecast hinges on a historical phenomenon known as the Bitcoin halving. Every four years, the number of Bitcoins awarded to miners gets cut in half, restricting supply and theoretically pushing prices upwards.
 
25% Chance Bitcoin Has Already Hit Its Peak
 
But Brandt examines deeper – he argues that past halving dates have coincided roughly with the midpoint of bull market cycles. With the most recent halving happening in April 2024, his analysis suggests a peak 16-18 months later, landing us squarely in t…]]></summary>
