        <updated>2023-04-24T23:48:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standard Chartered says crypto winter has ended and the price of bitcoin could reach $100K per coin by the end of next year. The global bank’s analyst has identified several factors contributing to the surge in the price of the cryptocurrency, including the recent turmoil in the banking sector.
 
Standard Chartered Bank on Bitcoin Hitting $100K
 
Global bank Standard Chartered said Monday that “crypto winter” is over and the price of bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024.
 
Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, explained in a note that bitcoin stands to benefit from various factors. They include the recent turmoil in the banking sector, a stabilization of risky assets as the U.S. Federal Reserve ends its cycle of interest rate hikes, and the enhanced profitability of cryptocurrency mining. The analyst wrote:
 

While sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer.
 
 
A growing number of individuals and analysts have recently expressed optimism regarding the outlook for bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $27,464, down from above $30K a week prior. However, the cryptocurrency is up 65% year-to-date.
 
In March, the CEO of investment management firm Vaneck said that “We are at the very beginnings of what could be a several-year cycle” in gold and bitcoin while Bloomberg Intelligence’s commodity strategist stated that a supercycle may be happening in BTC. In February, Pantera Capital said that we’re already in the next bull market cycle for bitcoin. Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki expects BTC to keep rising, predicting that the price of the largest crypto will reach $500K by 2025.
 
What do you think about Standard Chartered’s bitcoin prediction? Do you think the price of bitcoin will reach $100K by the end of next year? Let us know in the comments section below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a disclosure, Ben Labolt owns at least one bitcoin, and will be unable to serve in relation to matters related to past clients.
President Biden’s new communications director, Ben LaBolt, owns $50,000-$100,000 worth of bitcoin according to a regular disclosure filed. In addition, President Joe Biden has restricted the role of LaBolt in matters involving cryptocurrency and technology firms that LaBolt previously represented. The restrictions will apply to firms such as Meta Platforms, Haun Ventures and Shopify. LaBolt will, however, be permitted to advise on the president’s approach to regulating cryptocurrency and social media companies.
The restrictions imposed on LaBolt are consistent with rules followed by other senior White House staff.
The latest economic report from the White House which discussed Bitcoin for the most part wrote off the benefits of the technology, while simultaneously reflecting on the various properties that the Administration believes gives the U.S. dollar its value. While the latter was not wholly untrue, the former misrepresented the fundamental value of Bitcoin.
This came shortly after a roadmap was released that detailed the Administration’s plan to investigate an American CBDC and how that may be implemented. The same report also addressed various challenges that the White House sees in the cryptocurrency industry, mainly in reaction to the collapse of FTX in 2022. 
Beyond this, regulatory pressures from different agencies under the current Administration have led to major firms within the United States to potentially consider movement overseas, including Coinbase, the largest exchange in America. The U.S. would be much better off if the Biden Administration realized the capacity of the industry to create jobs and economic progress, along with the inherent benefits of Bitcoin adoption at large.]]></summary>

A Clear Pathway For DeFi Organizations
 
This new bill aims to modify the state’s existing unincorporated association (UA) entity form to provide a clear pathway for DAOs to use this form. According to Miles Jennings, a prominent blockchain expert, this new entity form will enable DAOs to overcome nearly all of the most pressing legal challenges they currently face.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the holdings of Dai whales and sharks had plunged to a bottom last month. The relevant indicator here is the “DAI Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the percentage of the total circulating supply of the stablecoin that each market wallet group is holding.
 
Addresses are divided into these wallet groups based on the number of coins they have in their balances. For example, the 100 to 1,000 coins cohort includes all addresses holding at least 100 and 1,000 tokens of the stablecoin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an announcement made on April 24, Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange with the largest trade volume, unveiled its latest staking product, wrapped beacon eth (WBETH). This new addition to Binance’s staking solutions is built on the Ethereum network, joining the ranks of other competing liquid staking products such as Lido, Coinbase, Rocket Pool, and Frax.
 
WBETH Emerges as Binance’s New Solution to Ethereum-Based Staking
 

 
Liquid staking products based on Ethereum have been gaining popularity over the past two years. According to defillama.com metrics, as of this writing, there are over 8.2 million ether worth $15.49 billion locked into liquid staking derivatives. A staggering 74.22% of these ether assets are held by Lido Finance, the current leader in this space.
 

 
Coinbase’s wrapped ether product comes in second with $2.19 billion locked, followed by Rocket Pool with $983.26 million, Frax with $297.09 million, and Stakewise with $163.98 million. Binance has revealed that it has created two contracts for its new WBETH token, one for the Binance Smart Chain and one for Ethereum. The token will be available for trading on Binance from Thursday, with BUSD, ETH, and USDT trading pairs.
 

 

 

 
Starting on April 27, 2023, users will be able to create WBETH by depositing 1 ether, and vice versa. “Each WBETH token will accrue ETH Staking rewards daily, in accordance with the daily APR on ETH Staking,” states Binance. Additionally, to “support the daily updates of the BETH/WBETH conversion rate, the ‘Wrap’ and ‘Unwrap’ functions will be temporarily paused each day” at a designated time.
 

 
What do you think the future holds for liquid staking products, and how will the launch of WBETH impact the competitive landscape? Share your thoughts about this subject in the comments section below.]]></summary>

Unit of account is the thing that measures the value of goods and services. It's an essential function for something to be [or become?] money. In simple terms, it is a standard measure of value, a common scaling system through which the value of products can be calculated and compared.
Countries typically have distinct units of account, identified as the national or regional currency, such as the euro (EUR) or the British pound (GBP). At the same time, internationally, the U.S. dollar (USD) is the unit of account that is mainly used for global invoicing and setting prices internationally.

According to a recent analysis by Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, BTC must double in value every four years or sustain extremely high fees to maintain its current level of security. 
 
 
Is Bitcoin’s Security Linked To Its Price?
 
In Bons’ analysis, he highlights that Bitcoin’s security model is based on its mining network, which requires a constant flow of new miners to maintain its security. However, suppose the price of Bitcoin continues to rise at its current pace. In that case, it will eventually reach a point where the cost of mining will become too high, leading to a decline in the number of miners and a subsequent decreas…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
