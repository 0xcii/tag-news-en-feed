        <updated>2024-04-23T08:34:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple Labs has formally opposed the US Securities and  
Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposition to levy a substantial fine of nearly $2  
billion against the company linked to the XRP Ledger blockchain. Filed yesterday  
(Monday), Ripple's opposition challenges the SEC's proposal, which seeks to  
persuade a New York judge to impose the hefty penalty.
Legal Battle Between Ripple and SEC
The SEC's proposal outlines a fine totalling $1.95 billion,  
comprising $876 million for disgorgement, $198 million for prejudgment  
interest, and a civil penalty of $876 million. The basis for the SEC's case  
stems from allegations that Ripple Labs violated federal securities laws  
through its institutional sales of XRP. Notably, the court ruled in favour of  
Ripple on some fronts, dismissing parallel claims by the SEC regarding the  
legality of XRP sales on exchanges and through algorithms.
Ripple's opposition document includes a redacted paragraph  
concerning its revenue from institutional sales, the income taxes it paid, and  
its incurred losses. Within this segment, Ripple asserts that it had no gains  
to disgorge, positioning it as a crucial argument in its defence against the  
SEC's proposed penalties.
“The Court should deny the SEC’s requests for an injunction,  
for disgorgement, and for pre-judgment interest, and should impose a civil  
penalty of no more than $10 million,” the filing said.

allegations of illegal sale of cryptocurrencies has reached a crucial step as the long-awaited  
trial starts today (Tuesday). The SEC first accused Ripple Labs of offering

Ripple's defense is based on the argument that its  
native cryptocurrency, XRP, should not be classified as a security. As the  
trial begins, the crypto sector is eagerly awaiting the outcome, which  
could have significant implications for the future of Ripple and the broader digital asset industry, CryptoPotato reported.

A recent court ruling against the SEC in a case against crypto platform DEBT Box has exposed accusations of misconduct and cast doubt on the agency’s regulatory tactics.
 
 
The controversy centers around a lawsuit filed by the SEC in August 2023, alleging a $50 million crypto fraud scheme perpetrated by DEBT Box. To halt the Utah-based company’s operations, the SEC secured a temporary freeze on its assets and restraining orders against its executives.
 
However, the case unraveled spectacularly in March 2024 when Judge Robert J. Shelby of the Utah District Court sanctioned the SEC for “egregious misrepresentations” during the initial hearing.…]]></summary>
