        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Russian currency’s exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar recently dropped below RUB100 per greenback — its lowest in 16 months. Economists attribute the ruble’s latest plunge to the effectiveness of a price cap imposed on Russian oil by Western countries. Russ Mould said a strengthening U.S. dollar could be the reason why the Russian currency has struggled against the greenback in the past few months. 
 
Impact of the Oil Price Cap
 
On Aug. 14, the Russian currency’s exchange rate versus the greenback dropped to a new low of just over 100 rubles for every dollar. The currency’s latest plunge means the ruble has now depreciated by over 8% in the past month and by more than 20% since the start of 2023.

has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This marks the latest setback  
for the financial technology company, which has faced a series of challenges  
over the past year, from regulatory intervention to failed acquisition attempts.
The collapse of Prime  
Trust gained momentum when it was placed under receivership by the regulators  
in Nevada in June. This action was taken due to the company's insolvency and  
inability to serve its customers. Additionally, a prospective acquisition by  
rival crypto custodian Bitgo fizzled out without explanation, causing concerns  
about the stability of the firm.
In June, Prime Trust's subsidiary, Banq, filed for bankruptcy due to

The decision to undertake this action is in line with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s endeavors to achieve stability for its own currency, which has been experiencing significant devaluation.
 
The official introduction of GBDT was first made in May, in response to the urgent demand for dependable and feasible market-driven resolutions.
 
 
The presence of an exceptionally high inflation rate of 175.8% in June served as an additional catalyst for increased demand from domestic investors.

Despite surpassing the customary 160-day review period, market participants eagerly await the next batch review scheduled for Friday at 11 am. 
 
According to finance Lawyer Scott Johnsson, August is a crucial month due to the “cycling” of law clerks in the District of Columbia (DC) courts, leading to the potential clearance of pending cases before the arrival of new personnel. 
 
While the decision could extend into September, Johnson suggests August remains a promising timeframe for a ruling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana was one of Tuesday’s big gainers, rising to a multi-week high following a ‘death cross’ of moving averages. The move came despite the global market cap falling marginally lower as of the time of writing. Toncoin was another notable mover, rising for a sixth-straight day.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) surged higher on Tuesday, as sentiment in the token has remained largely bullish in recent days.
 
SOL/USD peaked at $25.24 during today’s session, which follows up from a low of $24.35 to start the week.
 
This climb saw solana trade at its highest point since July 29, when price reached a high of $25.39.
 
 
The move came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should upward momentum continue to intensify, the next target for traders will likely be around the $26.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $24.82.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was also in the green in today’s session, as the price climbed for a sixth-consecutive session.
 
Following a low of $1.42 to start the week, TON/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1.49 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, toncoin moved to its strongest level since July 23, and closer to a ceiling of $1.50.
 
 
Similar to solana above, the rally came as the 10-day and 25-day moving averages neared an upwards cross.
 
One area of concern for bulls is the current reading of the RSI indicator, which is tracking at 66.91.
 
This is the highest area it has reached in the coin’s history, meaning it is greatly overbought, with bears potentially waiting to take advantage of this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The XRP ecosystem could face more vigorous opposition to its expansion from Stellar and native cryptocurrency XLM. The company recently acquired a minority stake in payment processor MoneyGram.
 
 
XRP v. Stellar: MoneyGram Could Tip Balance In Rivalry?
 
Denelle Dixon, CEO of the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), celebrated the deal in an official post. The partners have been collaborating since 2021 and, as a result, developed a crypto-backed product called MoneyGram Access.
 
Dixon emphasized the growth experienced by the XLM ecosystem since its partnership with MoneyGram, claiming that the Stellar network became the “leader of cash-to-crypto on and off-ramps” due to this product. The partners have focused on creating tools to provide people with access to the “digital economy.”
