According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the small LTC addresses have appeared to have been giving up recently as they have been emptying out their balances.
 
The metric of interest here is the total number of addresses on the Litecoin blockchain that are carrying a non-zero amount of the cryptocurrency. When the value of this indicator goes up, it means that the asset is observing more adoption as new investors are joining the network.
 
 
On the other hand, a decline suggests the holders are exiting the cryptocurrency as they are completely liquidating their wallets. Ado…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-12-07T17:39:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tether, the leading stablecoin by market capitalization, has seen its supply increase by 5.5% in the last month, achieving a significant market valuation of $90 billion.
 
Since 2015, Tether’s Market Cap Has Swelled by 35,912,812%
 
Since the dawn of 2023, tether (USDT) has experienced substantial growth. Starting the year with a market value of $66.3 billion on January 1, 2023, it has surged to $90 billion in 340 days. This expansion represents more than a 35% increase, adding $23.7 billion to USDT’s market capitalization since the year’s commencement.
 
Tether’s market capitalization now represents 5.369% of the total $1.68 trillion crypto economy. Not only does tether hold the third position among over 10,000 digital currencies in terms of market valuation, but it also leads in daily trading volume with $23 billion. USDT’s principal trading pairs involve major fiat currencies such as the USD, EUR, TRY, MXN, and THB.
 
While year-to-date data indicates a more than 35% rise in USDT’s market cap, 5.5% of this upswing occurred in the preceding month. According to Tether’s transparency page, of the $90 billion total, the Tron network accounts for $47.82 billion and Ethereum for $41.01 billion, with the remainder distributed across various other blockchain platforms.
 
 
Looking back to March 16, 2015, USDT’s market value was a modest $251,000. Over eight years, the coin’s market cap has soared by a massive 35,912,812%. Tether’s aggregate market valuation is on the brink of entering the world’s top 100 assets, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and companies, in terms of market capitalization. In order to achieve this feat, USDT will need a market cap of more than $130 billion.

        <updated>2023-12-07T16:48:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant breakthrough in the ongoing legal saga surrounding the founder of Terra Luna, Kwon Do-Hyung, known as Do Kwon, reports indicate that he is set to be extradited to the United States. 
 
According to the Wall Street Journal, Montenegro has privately confirmed its intention to send Do Kwon to the US to face criminal charges.
 
The Do Kwon Extradition To US Confirmed By Montenegro
 
The events leading up to this extradition decision began in March, when Kwon was arrested while attempting to leave the country with falsified documents. 
 
Once a prominent figure in the digital asset industry, Do Kwon’s reputation has suffered due to his involvement in manipulating the TerraUSD stablecoin, which led to a range of criminal charges being filed against him. 
 
 
Additionally, the massive $40 billion crash associated with his actions has prompted prosecutors in both the United States and South Korea to seek his trial.
 
Do Kwon’s Legal Team Fails To Halt Extradition Process 
 
Has Kwon’s arrest in Montenegro and subsequent detention in the country set the stage for his extradition? Reports indicate that he is indeed set to be extradited to the United States, with a senior Montenegrin justice official privately confirming the extradition plans. 
 
This development follows Kwon’s legal team’s unsuccessful attempts to circumvent the extradition process, including their appeal of a late November decision approving the extradition.
 
The charges against Kwon were brought forth by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in February. The Terra Luna founder stands accused of orchestrating a multibillion-dollar crypto asset securities fraud. 
 
 
With Do Kwon’s extradition imminent, a trial will likely ensue to address the crimes he committed during his tenure as the head of Terra Luna.
