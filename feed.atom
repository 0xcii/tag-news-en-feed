However, both meme coins have failed to follow the growth pattern of the largest asset in the crypto market and performed even worse compared to some of their altcoin counterparts, but this may not be all bad for the digital assets.
 
Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Fail To Make Large Gains
 
Over the last 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin has already risen tremendously to give the pioneer cryptocurrency double-digit gains. As expected, Bitcoin’s rally pulled the rest of the crypto market back into the green with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu included. However, despite the explosive rally, DOGE and SHIB have only made conservative gains during this period.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ltc-back-above-80-doge-extends-gains-following-inflation-report/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-14T15:22:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin rose by as much as 15% in Tuesday’s session, as markets reacted to the latest inflation report from the United States. Figures from the monthly Consumer Price Index showed that inflation has fallen to 6% in February, down from 6.4%. Dogecoin was also higher on the news, extending recent gains.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was once again in the green, as prices of the token rose above $80.00 on Tuesday.
 
Following a low of $75.20 to start the week, LTC/USD surged to an intraday peak of $86.34 earlier today.
 
As a result of the move, litecoin has risen to a seven-day high, breaking out of a ceiling at $85.00 in the process.
 
 
Overall, LTC is up nearly $20.00 in the last four days, since dropping to a bottom at $65.39 on Saturday.
 
The latest rally in price has pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) to a reading of 49.53, which is its highest point since March 2.
 
This is marginally above a ceiling at 48.00, and should price strength remain beyond this point, LTC bulls will likely attempt to reach $90.00.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
In addition to LTC, dogecoin (DOGE) also extended recent gains, with the meme coin climbing for a fifth straight day.
 
DOGE/USD has risen to an intraday high of $0.07492 earlier on Tuesday, which comes a day after trading at a low of $0.06866.
 
This rally comes as dogecoin broke out of a recent resistance level at $0.0730, with the RSI also climbing above a ceiling of its own.
 
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 47.15, which is well above the aforementioned ceiling at 45.00.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average is now firmly in an uptrend, with a ceiling of $0.08000 a possible target for bulls.
 
Price strength is closing in on a ceiling at 50.00. However, should it overcome this point, DOGE could reach its intended target.
