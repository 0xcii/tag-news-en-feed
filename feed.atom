Renowned ETF analysts, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, had previously estimated a 75% probability of approval for these ETFs earlier this year. However, this outlook appears to be in question given the recent delays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grayscale Investments, the largest digital asset fund manager by assets under management (AUM), has filed to convert its Ethereum Trust into a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). The news follows ether futures ETFs from Vaneck, Bitwise, and Proshares launching on Monday.
 
Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum Trust on Path to Become Spot Ether ETF
 
On October 2, 2023, Grayscale announced it has submitted a Form 19b-4 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Ethereum Trust into a physically backed ETF on NYSE Arca.
 
‚ÄúAs we file to convert ETHE to an ETF, the natural next step in the product‚Äôs evolution, we recognize this as an important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter,‚Äù Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said.
 
The company‚Äôs press release said the Form 19b-4 filing coincides with the futures ETFs from Vaneck, Proshares, and Bitwise that began trading Monday. Grayscale is also working to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a physically backed ETF but faces a legal challenge with the SEC over its approval. Launched in March 2019, the Ethereum Trust now has an AUM of $4.96 billion, Grayscale‚Äôs web portal shows.
 
 
Grayscale also plans to launch an ethereum futures ETF based on cash-settled CME futures contracts with regulatory approval. David LaValle, Grayscale‚Äôs global head of ETFs, said Monday that the filing ‚Äúis another important milestone as Grayscale continues to build its best-in-class ETF team, product suite, and capabilities ‚Äì serving investors as a globally respected asset manager with unmatched crypto expertise.‚Äù

From The Prosecution‚Äôs Angle
 
In an interview with Decrypt, these legal experts mentioned that the Prosecution‚Äôs proactiveness shows they are confident of securing a conviction. Usually, the prosecution takes time to gather as much evidence as possible before moving to trial to ensure that it secures a conviction.¬†
 
 
However, in this case, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has moved swiftly to kickstart the trial, which suggests that they have all the arsenal to put Sam Bankman-Fried in jail for a long time.¬†

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a characteristically bold and provocative post, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has once again stirred the financial world by declaring, "Fiat currency" a scam. Musk, responding to a post asking other X users what they think is a scam so normalized that people don't even realize it is a scam, did not provide further context in the post.
Fiat currency refers to traditional government-issued money, such as the US dollar, euro, or yen, that is not backed by a physical commodity like gold but relies on the trust and authority of the issuing government. Musk's comment adds fuel to the ongoing debate about the role of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in challenging traditional financial systems.
Bitcoin enthusiasts and advocates quickly rallied behind Musk's tweet, interpreting it as an endorsement for the digital currency. They argue that Bitcoin offer an alternative to fiat currency, with advantages of being decentralized and resistant to inflation.
Musk's statement adds to the growing discussion surrounding the role of Bitcoin in modern finance. While his post was brief, it remains to be seen whether Musk will further elaborate on his views regarding fiat currency or if this is another instance of his cryptic and attention-grabbing social media presence. Regardless, the debate over the future of money and the coexistence of traditional and digital currencies is unlikely to subside anytime soon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash rose to a multi-month high to start the week, as traders pushed the cryptocurrency above a key resistance level. The move came on the heels of the ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù trend, and ahead of a big week of U.S. economic data, headlined by the nonfarm payrolls report. Solana rose to its highest level since mid-August.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was a notable gainer on Monday, as the token rose to a two-month high to start the month.
 
BCH/USD peaked at $246.98 earlier in the day, after trading at a low of $233.74 during Sunday‚Äôs session.
 
This was the strongest point that bitcoin cash has hit since July 31, when price reached a high of $259.00
 
 
Looking at the chart, today‚Äôs move comes after a key resistance level of $245.00 was briefly broken, however bulls have gone on to retreat from earlier positions.
 
One reason for this was a collision that occurred on the relative strength index (RSI), which hit the 70.00 resistance point.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 69.53, with BCH at $243.30 as of writing.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) continued to be a big mover to start the month of October, after extending a recent bull run to a sixth straight day.
 
After hitting a bottom at $22.51 on Sunday, SOL/USD climbed to a high of $24.60 earlier in today‚Äôs session.
 
As a result of this surge, the world‚Äôs seventh largest cryptocurrency hit its strongest point since August 15.
 
 
The move sees solana near a key price point of $25.00, with the RSI moving deep into the overbought region in the process.
 
At the time of writing, the index is at the 74.33 position, which is its highest reading since July 17.
