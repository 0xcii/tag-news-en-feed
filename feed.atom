Starting November 15, 2024, all transactions involved in cryptocurrency exchange and conversion will be exempted from Value Added Tax. It aims at attracting both individual investors and institutional players who seek tax-friendly environments, according to a statement issued by the Federal Tax Authority.
 
 
Crypto Transactions: New Regulations
 
New law seems to break the previous traditions where crypto transactions were taxed at 5% VAT. The tax was considered an entry barrier for most potential investors and businesses in the rapidly changing digital asset space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), EIP-7781, introduced on October 5 by Illyriad Games co-founder Ben Adams, could significantly boost Ethereum’s transaction throughput by reducing the network’s slot time from 12 seconds to 9 seconds. The proposed change is aimed at increasing transaction throughput by approximately 33%.
 
The motivation behind the proposal is to better distribute bandwidth usage over time, thereby lowering peak bandwidth requirements. By smoothing out bandwidth needs, Ethereum could maintain greater efficiency and reduce stress on node operators, particularly those with limited bandwidth capacity. According to Adams, this adjustment is designed to enhance throughput without compromising the accessibility of the network.
