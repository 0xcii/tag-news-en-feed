        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-consolidates-to-start-weekend-eth-remains-below-1900/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-08T12:34:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was hovering near the $30,000 level to start the weekend, as markets continued to digest the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. Payrolls came in at 209,000, less than the 225,000 expected, putting slight doubt in a potential July rate hike. Ethereum continued to trade below $1,900 on Saturday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the weekend consolidating around the $30,000 level, following the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $30,094.87, a day after trading at a one-year high above $31,000.
 
The price has marginally increased following today’s earlier row, and is now trading at $30,240.85.
 
 
Overall, it appears that a failed breakout of a ceiling at 58.00 on the relative strength index (RSI) was the catalyst of this drop.
 
Price strength is now tracking at the 57.63 level, with a support point at 55.00 a possible target for traders.
 
Should it reach this point, it is highly likely that BTC will move below $30,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also started the weekend consolidating, with the cryptocurrency once again moving below $1,900.
 
Since hitting a peak at $1,957 on Thursday, ETH/USD has failed to trade above $1,900, with today’s drop taking price to a low of $1,854.92.
 
After reaching a two-month high on June 3, ethereum has struggled, with price falling lower in consecutive sessions.
 
 
These declines have pushed price strength to a floor at 47.00, however this support point has so far been stable, helping to stop the prior bleeding.
 
The index is now tracking at a reading of 49.59, with an upcoming resistance level of 51.00 the next test for traders.
 
In the event they pass this test, the next destination for price will likely be back above $1,900.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Binance, some of its executives have decided to leave the firm. This legal action also sparked criticism regarding alleged preferential treatment given to Coinbase, a US-based crypto exchange.
 
The lawsuit has prompted discussions about whether the SEC’s aggressive enforcement measures played a role in the departure of several high-ranking executives from Binance’s US division.
 
However, these departing individuals have stated that their reasons for leaving are unrelated to the ongoing lawsuit.
 
 
Departures And Potential Replacements
 
Han Ng, the General Counsel, Patrick Hillmann, the Chief Strategy Officer, and Steven Christie, the senior vice president for Compliance, are among those who have left Binance.
