        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red tape and confusion has been the theme in crypto news as of late, with cryptocurrency firms scrambling to stay compliant with regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with little to no definite regulatory clarity made available to them thus far. In the wake of lawsuits being launched by the SEC against massive exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, a former SEC official has warned of regulatory “siege” against crypto platforms, a judge has blocked efforts by the regulator to freeze Binance US’ assets, and economist Peter Schiff has said the Fed destroyed the U.S. banking system. This and more, just below, in the Bitcoin.com News Week in Review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New York-based digital assets platform Bakkt has decided to delist three prominent cryptocurrencies—Solana, Cardano, and Polygon—due to regulatory uncertainty and a lack of clarity. This move follows recent lawsuits filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against leading crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance, alleging the sale of unregistered securities, including Solana, Cardano, and Polygon.
 
The SEC’s legal actions marked the first time these three cryptocurrencies were specifically identified as securities. While SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has consistently asserted that most cryptocurrencies, except for Bitcoin, fall under the securities category, this regulatory development has prompted Bakkt and other crypto platforms to reassess their token listings.

BlackRock’s iShares Trust Vs. GBTC
 
BlackRock’s iShares product, technically classified as a trust, offers redemptions similar to an ETF, unlike GBTC.
 
Noelle Acheson clarifies that the market may mistakenly associate “trust” with GBTC’s lack of redemption options, but this is not true for BlackRock’s offering.
 

 
 
The key disparity between a BTC ETF and a trust lies in the ETF’s ability to purchase bitcoin at the end of the trading day to align the fund’s assets with its trading price.
