Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now Pointing At “Greed”
 
The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency sector. The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100 for representing this sentiment.

While this cutoff may be clean in theory, the region between the values of 46 and 54 (that is, the boundary of the two sentiments) is considered to signify a neutral sentiment.

This move has pushed bitcoin to its highest point in the last seven-days, when it was trading above $30,000.

Overall, the surge in price comes as bulls rejected a breakout below a long-term support point at $27,000 on Tuesday.
 
The relative strength index (RSI) also bounced from a floor of its own at the 44.00 mark, and is now tracking at 54.09.
 
A ceiling of 55.00 will likely act as a checkpoint for bulls, and should they move beyond this, there is a strong possibility that BTC climbs to $30,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also in the green, as prices snapped a three-day losing streak.
 
Following a low of $1,805.32 on Tuesday, ETH/USD jumped to a peak at $1,919.72 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this move, ethereum has hit a five-day high, with price now hovering around a resistance point at $1,915.

The last time ETH bulls broke this ceiling was on April 13, and on the occasion the price went on to reach an 11-month high above $2,100.
 
In order for something similar to happen this go round, the RSI would need to overcome a hurdle at the 53.00 level.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 51.64.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
