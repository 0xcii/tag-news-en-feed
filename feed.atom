Still, crypto investors should bear in mind some economic and financial data this trading week.
 
In particular, as Bitcoin has returned to its correlation with the U.S. stock indices and the dollar index (DXY), the price could be affected by this news.
 
Over the weekend, Bitcoin briefly corrected to a new 12-day low at $22,775, but still managed to end the week above $23,300. The new week will have to show whether the upward trend that has persisted since January will continue or whether there will be a deeper correction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin hardware company has begun manufacturing its own chip wrapper for the Trezor Model T.
Trezor, a Prague-based Bitcoin hardware company, has announced that it has taken control of its silicon chip supply chain.
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the company has achieved this by facilitating the manufacture of its own key component, the chip wrapper, for its flagship product, the Trezor Model T. The new chip wrapper “improves device security and significantly shortens lead times for mass production,” the release states.
With the silicon chip supply chain under constant geopolitical pressure, securing the manufacturing of this important component is a source of confidence in the ability for Trezor to continue producing its products. 
Štěpán Uherik, CFO at Trezor, commented that “The twists and turns in demand for hardware wallets and the silicon supply chain disruption that we’ve seen over the past few years was a problem that we needed to solve. By unpacking the process, identifying areas where we could take control, and collaborating with our partners in new ways, we’ve managed to make the manufacturing as agile as it can be.” 
He added that “It also adds more design freedom for future products, helping us to sustain our leadership in the increasingly competitive hardware wallet space.” 
SatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor, also announced last year the development of an open-source chip for usage in Bitcoin hardware. Just recently, the company detailed that the initial testing on the first chip, TROPIC01, had been completed, with expectations of continued testing throughout 2023.]]></summary>

According to on-chain data provider Lookonchain, two hours before press time, a “smart money” investor made a large Shiba Inu transfer. The whale just sent 182 billion SHIB, the equivalent of about $2.3 million to crypto exchanges Crypto.com and Gemini.
 
The last time he transferred SHIB to Crypto.com in this magnitude, the price of SHIB fell by 7%. This was in mid-December 2022, when the whale transferred 200 billion SHIB worth $1.67 million to the Singapore-based exchange.
