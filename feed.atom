        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federal investigators had confiscated $9 million worth of crypto connected to a Silicon Valley-based cyber scam group that had taken advantage of over 70 victims, the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California disclosed on Tuesday.
 
The intercepted funds were in the form of stablecoin Tether which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, and successfully traced back to addresses that are purportedly linked to an entity engaged in the exploitation of unsuspecting individuals through romance and confidence scams involving cryptocurrencies, commonly referred to as “pig butchering.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Latest data unveils a remarkable milestone in Bitcoin's  
journey, with a record-high percentage—70.35%—of the circulating supply  
remaining inactive for over a year, as reported by CoinDesk. This substantial figure, surpassing the  
previous peak in July, reflects a profound conviction among Bitcoin holders  
amidst wider market uncertainties and macroeconomic headwinds. Despite the  
digital asset's impressive surge to $37,000 this year, long-term investors, it  
seems, are resolute in their commitment.
  
While current metrics suggest a steadfast investor base, the impending  
financialization of Bitcoin through instruments like exchange-traded funds  
(ETFs) introduces an element of unpredictability. As higher prices beckon, the  
landscape may witness new sellers entering the market,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, welcomes the inception of HUB21, a pioneering non-profit association dedicated to education, fostering research, and creating networking avenues within the global Bitcoin design and development ecosystem, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. The association's launch aims to bridge the gap in understanding and participation in Bitcoin within Serbia's burgeoning IT landscape.
Belgrade, known for its cultural vibrancy and historical innovation, is poised to attract foreign professionals, investors, and creative minds to engage with HUB21. While Serbia boasts a wealth of IT talent and has attracted international corporations, the absence of Bitcoin projects is apparent. Recognizing the transformative power of Bitcoin, HUB21 aims to train more aspiring programmers, artists, designers, and entrepreneurs to capitalize on the evolving interest in Bitcoin.
HUB21's agenda involves providing educational resources in Serbian, hosting regular meetups, workshops, seminars, and creating an inclusive space for industry novices and experts alike. The association's vision extends towards empowering local talent across various sectors to leverage Bitcoin and foster their initiatives.
Startups Primal.net and PeakShift have played pivotal roles in realizing HUB21's vision and by giving their support. The launch of HUB21's website offers a gateway to a diverse range of upcoming events, which can be viewed here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the wake of the recent crypto crackdown by U.S. authorities, the 
landscape of the cryptocurrency market, valued at around $1.4 trillion, is 
undergoing seismic shifts. As the dust settles on the 
conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of FTX crypto exchange, a new 
chapter unfolds with the 
guilty plea of Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of Binance, the 
world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.
 
The conviction of Bankman-Fried and Zhao's guilty plea cast a shadow over 
the crypto industry, prompting reflections on its tainted image. The 
government's message here is unequivocal: breaking the law using new technology 
brands one a criminal, not a disruptor.

She urged the DOJ to probe Binance for alleged deceit towards Congress. This tweet, highlighting the need for stringent regulatory oversight, inadvertently set the stage for Nerayoff’s revelations.
