What Musk Had To Say About Bitcoin And Other Cryptos
 
Musk mentioned during an appearance at the X takeover podcast hosted by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley that he won’t be promoting crypto, and at most, it could be in a “joking way.” He further said, “If you see me pumping crypto, it’s not me,” suggesting he has no affinity or support for cryptocurrencies.

 In the case, though, of spot ETH ETFs, which went into operation last Tuesday, it feels in some ways like a different story. Approval from the SEC came through in May, but that decision surprised many observers and even prompted speculation that there could have been political motivations at work, since presidential candidate Donald Trump was at that time in the process of establishing a publicly pro-crypto campaign stance.
 From there, it didn’t take long to get to launch, and while 2024 is becoming a year that will be remembered for its crypto ETF developments (…]]></summary>

Much speculation has arisen as a result of this massive transaction regarding the motivations behind the transfer and any potential political implications.
 
 
The Evolution Of Bitcoin Transactions
 
A tumultuous history surrounds this 28,000 Bitcoin deal. In 2020, after the Silk Road dark web market had shuttered, the US Department of Justice seized them. The seizure was an operation to root out criminals who were utilizing bitcoin in their nefarious ways.
 
A US appeals court upheld the confiscation of 69,370 Bitcoins and other cryptocurrency linked to Silk Road’s operations in December 2023, prompting the current action.
