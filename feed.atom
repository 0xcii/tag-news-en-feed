If, in 2021, the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery, so too does the two-year period from 2008 to 2010 when Bitcoin’s creator served as the project’s principal developer and leader. 
Yet, far from a lifeless period of project development, during those years Nakamoto worked with dozens if not hundreds of Bitcoin users, all of whom contributed to the effort in different ways, establishing websites, engaging in commerce and evangelizing for his invention. 
Still, some users naturally emerged as more distinguished contributors.

AVAX is currently testing a key support level that, if respected, could pave the way for further gains. Analysts suggest that this level is crucial for maintaining the uptrend and potentially leading to more upside for the Layer-1 blockchain. 
 
If the support holds, it could signal a bullish continuation, with the price possibly retesting previous highs and moving beyond. However, the asset may see further declines or sideways movement if the support fails. The coming days will be …]]></summary>
