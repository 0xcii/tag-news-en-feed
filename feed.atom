However, he cautions that the journey to this six-figure milestone may take work.
 
During a recent interview with renowned crypto influencer Scott Melker, McGlone expressed his unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s potential to achieve a six-figure price. 
 
Yet, he did raise a red flag, suggesting that the king crypto might encounter a significant setback along the way, possibly causing its value to dip below the $20,000 mark temporarily before surging toward the much-anticipated $100,000 level.
