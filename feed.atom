        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The lawyers representing Terraform Labs and its CEO Do Kwon in the ongoing court case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have pushed against an extradition request of the securities regulator.
 
In a petition submitted on September 27, the defendants are nudging the court to reject the SEC’s request to transport Do Kwon to the US for questioning over his alleged involvement in the crash of the Terra ecosystem. 
 
Back in February, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Terraform Labs and its co-founder and CEO Do Hyeong Kwon, accusing both parties of orchestrating a multi-billion dollar fraud by promoting investment in an inter-connected suite of crypto asset securities, which included the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and digital asset LUNA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chase UK’s recent decision to ban cryptocurrency transactions for its customers has sparked debate within the crypto community. While the bank cites concerns over scams and fraud as the rationale behind this move, critics argue that it contradicts the United Kingdom’s crypto policy objectives. 
 
Jesper Johansen, founder and CEO of crypto service provider Northstake, expressed his reservations about the decision in an interview with Blockworks, stating:
 
 
“Firstly, this ban contradicts the UK government’s stated policy goal to develop favorable conditions and a supportive environment for crypto businesses to set up and scale their services.”  
 
This divergence from national policy goals raises questions about the bank’s commitment to the country’s evolving crypto landscape.

The Spherex boss also suggested deploying an exploit prevention solution as another way protocols can prevent attackers from using errors in code to steal digital assets worth millions.
