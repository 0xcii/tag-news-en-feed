financial stability. Our latest PoR update reinforces our dedication to  
safeguarding user assets and upholding the highest accountability standards.  
With a total reserve ratio of 176%, Bitget continues to lead by example in the

billion. The company plans to conduct routine audits to  
ensure continuous visibility into Bitget's reserves. The latest update  
highlighted a significant upsurge in USDT and ETH user assets by 51% and 46%
