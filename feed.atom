        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The meme coins sector of the crypto market is taking a big hit amidst a wider price decline in the industry. Recent lackluster price action has seen most cryptocurrencies struggling to maintain bullish price action for the majority of last week. 
 
This price decline has now been exacerbated with the latest escalation of tensions in the Middle East which seems to have rattled investors and driven down prices of popular meme coins. 
 
 
As news broke of Iranian fighter drones on their way to Israel, meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogwifhat (WIF) saw price drops of over 10% in a matter of hours.

Cardano’s Lackluster Price Performance
 
At the time of writing, Cardano has seen its price fall by 34.40% in the past 30 days.

The price is retracing at the moment, and there are possibilities that it could still move downward. At this point, it could be that BTC’s price is losing steam and headed for a downward shift.
 
At the time of writing, the price of BTC was up by 0.9%, trading around $67,734 below the 4-hour 100-day moving average in the last 24 hours. However, in the daily timeframe, the price is still trading above the 100-day moving average.
 
Bitcoin On The 4-hour Chart
 
Looking at the 4-hour timeframe chart, Bitcoin is already trading below the 100-day moving average and trying to break below the trend line. The price could start a new trend downward if it manages to break below the trend line.

Bitcoin is often compared to the internet in the 1990s, but I believe the better analogy is to the telegraph in the 1840s.[1]
The telegraph was the first technology to transmit encoded data at near-light speed over long distances. It marked the birth of the telecommunications industry. The internet, though it is bigger in scale, richer in content, and manyto-many instead of one-to-one, …]]></summary>
