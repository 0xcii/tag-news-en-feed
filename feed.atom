#1 US Spot Ethereum ETF Deadline Looms
 
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faces pivotal deadlines on May 23 and May 24 regarding the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs proposed by VanEck and ArkInvest/21Shares, respectively.
 
The likelihood of approval this month has significantly declined. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the odds as “slim to none,” pointing to the SEC’s silence as a major indicator.

Pump Fun aimed to capitalize on the memecoin craze sweeping the crypto world. However, the platform remained obscure until Dunn’s alleged hack thrust it into the spotlight.

Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York in January 2023 following the troubles it faced from its exposure to Three Arrows Capital, a collapsed crypto hedge fund, and FTX, which is also under bankruptcy process. At the time of bankruptcy, it owed over $3.5 billion to the top 50 creditors alone.…]]></summary>
