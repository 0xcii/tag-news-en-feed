The truth is, I don’t care all that much anymore about party politics, about the upcoming presidential election cycle, about supposedly heartfelt and earnest liberal and conservative political expressions within the American polity, about the hand-wringing surrounding the tenuous future of American Democracy, etc. What I do care about, however, is how easy it is for human beings to be manipulated, to believe the lies.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-trx-hits-1-year-high-following-integration-on-ethereum-network/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-03T13:34:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tron rose to a one-year high to start the weekend, as founder Justin Sun confirmed an integration to the ethereum blockchain network. In a tweet, Sun said, “TRON has now expanded its reach by going live on the Ethereum blockchain by leveraging the BitTorrent bridge.” 
 
Tron (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) was one the biggest movers on Saturday, with prices rising by as much as 11% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $0.0762 on Friday, TRX/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.08545 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the surge, the token, which recently registered a record number of daily transactions, hit its highest point since June 2 last year.
 
 
Overall, tron is up 12.16% in the last seven days, with the latest rally leading to a breakout of a ceiling at $0.0796
 
The relative strength index (RSI) also moved above a resistance level of its own at 70.00, and is now tracking at 75.77.
 
Should this uptrend continue, there is a good chance that bulls will attempt to take the index to a higher ceiling at 79.00.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, hit a multi-week high to start the weekend, colliding with a key price ceiling in the process.
 
XRP/USD surged to a high of $0.5299 earlier on Saturday, which comes following yesterday’s low of $0.5137.
 
This move led to the token nearing a collision with a resistance level at $0.5300, securing its highest point since April 19 in the process.
 
 
Following this, prices have since slipped, with earlier bulls seemingly opting to secure gains.
 
At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5234, and this comes as the RSI falls below its own ceiling at 69.00.
 
Price strength is now at 67.71, with the next visible floor at the 64.00 mark.

‘Dad Almost Certainly Hacked,’ Son Tweets After Peter Schiff Launches $GOLD Token on Twitter
 
Hackers obviously took control of economist Peter Schiff’s Twitter account to promote the supposed launch of a “groundbreaking cryptocurrency token” called $GOLD. A series of tweets posted in the space of a few hours suggested that the digital asset represents tokenized gold and is “a complete and utter gamechanger for gold-backed DeFi” that will “empower the #Web3 community.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the weekend in the red, as markets continued to digest the latest nonfarm payrolls in the United States. Despite payrolls coming in better than expected, the unemployment rate also rose, hitting 3.7%, which is its highest point since last October.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was mostly consolidating to start the weekend, as traders continued to digest the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls data.
 
Payrolls rose to 339,000 last month, which was higher than the 190,000 markets were expecting.
 
Following a low of $26,898.00 on Friday, BTC/USD is trading at $27,149.78 at the time of writing.
 
 
For many, a recent upward crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages was a signal that bullish momentum was set to return.
 
However, yesterday’s economic data has added more questions than provided answers, as to what the Federal Reserve could do in its upcoming meeting.
 
A ceiling at $27,300 remains a key hurdle for bulls to overcome, and should this occur, the chances of a move to $28,000 will increase.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) briefly broke out of the $1,900 level to start the weekend. However, it has since rebounded.
 
ETH/USD bounced to a peak of $1,910.28 on Saturday, after an earlier move which saw it land at a bottom at $1,878.61.
 
At the time of writing, ethereum is trading at $1,903.70, with prices 0.63% higher than the aforementioned low.
 
 
In order to increase this percentage, the relative strength index (RSI) will need to rise above a ceiling at 49.00.
 
The index is currently tracking at 48.08, with bears attempting to take it towards a support point at 47.00.
 
Should bulls reject this, the ETH 10-day (red) moving average will likely extend its own crossover, which could help spur another uptrend.

Rohit has expressed his disappointment in Musk’s alleged actions, stating that they go against the core principles of the cryptocurrency market.  
 
According to Rohit, the cryptocurrency market is built on trust and transparency. Investors trust that the market is fair and open to all participants, without any undue influence from powerful individuals. Musk’s alleged actions, if true, would undermine this trust and make it more difficult for honest investors to succeed.
