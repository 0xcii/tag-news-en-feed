Recently, I’ve been thinking a good deal about Balaji Srinivasan’s $1 million dollar bet that bitcoin would reach $1 million in June (which he recently conceded), his apparent hyperbole with regard to imminent U.S. dollar hyperinflation and his musings about digital lockdowns. It all sounds a bit far-fetched to me. 
On this score, he reminds me of Peter Schiff, a man who for decades has told us the sky is falling and that the world will end as fiat currencies all collapse; a man who claims intellectual superiority over the “fools” at the Federal Reserve (meanwhile and generally speaking, the global economy hums along and collapse appears, at leas…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-hovers-near-key-price-floor-ahead-of-us-inflation-report/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-10T12:49:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was hovering close to a key price floor near $27,300 on Wednesday, as markets anticipated the upcoming U.S. inflation report. Consumer prices for last month are expected to remain at 5%, which could be seen as justifying the Federal Reserve’s decision to hike rates last week. Ethereum remained above $1,800. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to consolidate on Wednesday, as markets awaited the latest inflation report from the United States.
 
Following a high of $27,824.39 on Tuesday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,375.60 earlier in today’s session.
 
Today’s move pushed bitcoin close to a key support point at $27,300, however prices have since rebounded.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, it appears that the previous drop took place following a breakout on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Price strength moved below a floor at 43.00, with the index tracking at 42.63 at the time of writing.
 
Bitcoin is now trading at $27,607.96.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum also hovered close to a support point of its own in today’s session, as overall market sentiment remained uncertain.
 
ETH/USD hit a bottom of $1,835.70 on Wednesday, which comes a few days removed from price trading above $2,000.
 
Overall, ethereum is now in the red for a fifth consecutive day, and is down nearly 10% within that period.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This recent run has sent the 25-day (blue) moving average (MA) lower, with the trend line fast approaching its 10-day (red) counterpart.
 
Although longer-term momentum is slowing, the fact that the 10-day MA is below the 25-day line, means an upwards crossover could lead to a bull run.
 
Should this occur, there is a good chance that the target for bulls will be to recapture the $2,000 point.

The billionaire behind Unreal Engine and Fortnite, Sweeney came to Twitter on May 9 to mock PR agency CEO Ed Zitron’s article titled, “RIP Metaverse, we hardly knew ye,” which saw print on Insider earlier this week.
 
According to the article, the “once-buzzy technology… died after being abandoned by the business world.” Zitron believes that Horizon Worlds, Meta’s virtual reality platform, hasn’t lived up to its “grand promise” of becoming the internet of the future.
 
Contrary to Zitron’s claims, Sweeney said that 600 million people use virtual worlds like Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, The Sandbox, and VR Chat.
