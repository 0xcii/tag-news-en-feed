The announcement comes after Bitmain’s recent launches of filecoin and kaspa machines and the company’s latest series of bitcoin miners.
 
Aleo’s L1 Blockchain to Get Bitmain Mining Support
 
According to a recent Bitmain post, the company intends to introduce a miner compatible with the forthcoming blockchain network Aleo.

Additionally, the fraudulent emails deceive  
creditors, stating that as "priority clients", they can expedite

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week surging towards the $31,000 level, as the S&P 500 fell to a four-month low. Momentum in crypto markets has remained mostly bullish in recent days, following speculation on upcoming exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals by the United States SEC. Ethereum rose above the $1,700 mark.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin climbed to a fresh multi-month high to start the week, as market sentiment remained high following speculation on potential ETF approvals.
 
After trading at a low of $29,734 on Sunday, BTC/USD peaked at the $30,951 level during today’s session.
 
This move saw bitcoin climb to its strongest level since July 14, when price hovered close to $32,000.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Monday’s gains sent the relative strength index (RSI) above the 76.00 mark for the first time since the beginning of the year.
 
As a result of the cryptocurrency being extremely overbought, bears that are currently sidelined could be pondering reentry.
 
In the event that this comes into fruition, sellers could aim to push bitcoin to a long-term floor of $29,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rallied above the $1,700 level on Monday, hitting a three-week high in the process.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,705.37 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,623.98.
 
As a result of today’s high, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency climbed to its highest level since the start of the month.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
The move saw ethereum climb for a fifth straight session, which came as the RSI broke out of a resistance at 60.00.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 62.40, with the next visible ceiling on the index at the 65.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, ethereum is trading at $1,676.39.

Following this, Bankman-Fried and his lawyers are set to open their defense (or maybe not) this week in what could prove very pivotal as to the direction of the case and SBF’s fate. 
 
What Will Sam Bankman-Fried’s Lawyers Do?
 
Specifically, SBF’s trial will continue on October 26, when he and his lawyers will need to inform the court on what step they intend to take next. As to the next steps they can take, they can either choose to open a defense and present witnesses and evidence to the jury. They can also choose to waive the case and not put up any defense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has come under intense selling pressure, with crypto analyst Nicholas Merten, known as the host of DataDash, predicting a significant downward leg for the leading cryptocurrency. In a recent strategy session, Merten expressed concerns that BTC is primed for a bearish move.
 
Merten’s analysis revolves around the persistent resistance that Bitcoin has encountered at a critical channel. 
 
“The question here is whether or not we’re going to be able to clear through this channel of resistance, which each and every time has proven as resistance for Bitcoin,” the analyst said. He emphasized that this recurrent resistance could pave the way for a substantial downward move.
