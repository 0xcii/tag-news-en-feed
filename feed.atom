Zion, the Web5-based social network, has unveiled an update that enables users to make bitcoin payments using the Lightning Network within their private, encrypted direct messages (DMs). With this integration, Zion empowers its users to send and receive bitcoin instantly, while ensuring privacy and freedom from censorship.



By leveraging the Lightning Network, transactions are near-instantaneous and bypass the need for traditional payment processors. Zion ensures that conversations within DMs remain secure and confidential by incorporating encryption, so that users can communicate with one another without fear of their messages being accessed or monitored.
RPReplay_Final1686064173 (; 0:12) 
The introduction of bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network aligns with Zion's core mission of liberating social media from the control of large tech companies. By leveraging bitcoin's decentralized nature and the Lightning Network's capabilities, Zion enables users to transact and communicate freely without compromising their privacy or facing restrictions imposed by traditional social media platforms.
This integration within Zion's ecosystem eliminates the need for platform fees, ensuring that the value users send or receive remains intact. Every satoshi (sats) matters, with 1,000 sats being equal to 1,000 sats, providing a seamless experience for users engaging in financial transactions.
The introduction of Bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network represents a significant step for Zion in its quest to redefine the social media landscape. By embracing Lightning, Zion can provide a platform where users can freely express themselves while supporting content creators directly.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fallout from the collapse of major crypto exchange FTX continues, as the liquidator attempts to recover nearly $4 billion for creditors from another bankrupt crypto firm, Genesis Global Capital (GGC). 
 
According to Wired, the court in the Southern District of New York will decide on June 15 whether to allow FTX to pursue GGC over payments made shortly before the exchange’s collapse, amid allegations of fraud.
 
GGC filed for bankruptcy in January, after being caught in the blowback from FTX’s implosion. However, the firm only has about $5 billion in assets, meaning that if the court allows FTX to go ahead, a zero-sum legal battle will ensue. This will result in very low recoveries for Genesis creditors, according to Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of wealth management firm Lumida Wealth.

The SEC claims that Coinbase's failure to register has deprived investors of essential protections such as SEC inspection, recordkeeping requirements, and safeguards against conflicts of interest. The charges also extend to Coinbase's holding comp…]]></summary>
