The SEC alleges that ConsenSys violated federal securities laws by operating as an unregistered broker and dealer while offering services for “crypto securities,” amassing fees exceeding $250 million. 
 
SEC Lawsuit Against ConsenSys 
 
The SEC’s lawsuit against ConsenSys echoes similar complaints against other crypto firms such as Coinbase and Kraken. However, what sets this lawsuit apart is the context surrounding ConsenSys’ response to the SEC’s actions.

Bitcoin Users Paid $440 Million In Transaction Fees Last Quarter
 
As market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock pointed out in a new post on X, Bitcoin has registered a sharp jump in transaction fees this past quarter.

Where others have seen between 5-20% decline, FLOKI has lost more than half of its all-time high value, driving back downward toward April levels.

According to crypto analyst Cryptorphic, the fact that the FLOKI price has been able to maintain an important support level bodes well for it going forward. This support level is the $0.000155, which the meme coin has managed to hold following the price crash. This has made it a possible bounce point for a price rally.

As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the BTC long-term holder supply hasn’t been showing any signs of growth recently. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have held onto their coins for over 155 days.
 
 
The LTHs comprise one of the two main divisions of the BTC market based on holding time, with the other cohorts being known as the “short-term holders” (STHs).
 
Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the LTHs are considered the stubborn pa…]]></summary>
