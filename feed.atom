in the US, Bitstamp, one of the industry's oldest digital asset exchanges, is  
making a significant move by discontinuing its Ethereum (ETH) staking services  
for customers based in the US. This decision comes as a result of heightened  
regulatory dynamics in the country, particularly concerning crypto-staking  
services.  
Starting September 25,  
2023, the exchange said that US-based users will no longer have access to  
staking their ETH on the platform. Before the deadline, users can continue to  
earn staking rewards, with these rewards and principal amounts eventually being  
credited to users' primary Bitstamp account balances. However, these changes
