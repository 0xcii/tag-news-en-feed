The network’s difficulty indicates the complexity of finding a hash below a particular target, essentially representing the computational power needed to mine a block. This self-regulation, embedded in Bitcoin’s code, ensures steady block times, predictable issuance, and network security.
 
As Bitcoin Halving Approaches, Miners Face More Than a Dozen Difficulty Retargets After Weathering 400+
 
Bitcoin’s difficulty saw a 6.47% increase this week, surpassing the 61 trillion mark at block height 812,448. This marked the cryptocurrency’s 403rd difficulty epoch, some of which included retargets with no change. In basic terms, Bitcoin’s di…]]></summary>

The spiraling debt of sovereign nations have heightened concerns about currency debasement.

There's a growing chorus of people convinced that gold is the sole antidote to the hyperinflationary threat to fiat money. 
The question of whether Bitcoin is sound money has long provoked debates among economists, investors, and financial pundits. Bitcoin, being an intangible digital asset, is often dismissed by sound money advocates because it doesn't of…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meme coins were one of the biggest casualties of Wednesday’s price consolidation, falling by as much as 2% in today’s session. The decline comes as a result of profit taking, following strong gains to start the week. Shiba inu and dogecoin remain in the red, as of writing.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was a notable mover on Wednesday, as the meme coin fell for a second consecutive day.
 
Following a high of $0.000006945 during yesterday’s session, SHIB/USD slipped to an intraday low at $0.000006842 earlier today.
 
The move saw SHIB drop towards a key support level of $0.00000670, which was last hit on October 12.
 
 
This decline comes as the relative strength index (RSI) collided with a floor of its own, at the 39.00 zone.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking marginally below this point at 38.49, and should it continue to fall, could be heading to a lower support level of 35.00.
 
Wednesday’s sell-off comes after shiba inu rose to one week high of $0.00000729 on Monday.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) also dropped lower on hump-day, as it moved closer to a key support level of its own.
 
DOGE/USD hit a bottom of $0.0588 during today’s session, less than 24 hours after peaking at the $0.05961 point.
 
As referenced earlier, the move, which is also the second consecutive drop in price for DOGE, pushed it towards a floor at $0.0570.
 
 
Unlike with shiba inu’s RSI, which was still hovering close to support, price strength on dogecoin fell under its point of stability of 40.00.
 
Currently, the index is at a reading of 38.85, which coincides with the 10-day (red) moving average extending a downtrend.
