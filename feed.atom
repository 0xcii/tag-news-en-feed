Bitcoin MPI Recently Touched Highest Levels Since January 2021
 
An analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that the Miners’ Position Index has recently observed a sharp spike.

The “miner outflows” here are a measure of the total amount of the cryptocurrency that’s exiting the combined wallets of all chain validators (called the “miner reserve“).
 
 
Generally, the main reason why this cohort transfers coins out of their addresses is for selling purposes, so the miner out…]]></summary>
