        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The authorities in Bulgaria have closed the investigation against crypto lending platform Nexo, citing a lack of evidence to support the allegations. As confirmed yesterday (Friday) by the Bulgarian News Agency, the Prosecutor's Office highlighted that cryptocurrencies are not regulated, and products offered by Nexo do not constitute financial instruments.
Prosecutors Could Not Establish the Serious Charges
The investigation against Nexo in Bulgaria surfaced earlier this year with raids at the company’s Bulgarian offices. The probe alleged various charges, including tax offenses, banking without a license, money laundering, and computer fraud. The investigation was focused on four Nexo executives - Kosta Kanchev, Antoni Trenchev, Kalin Metodiev, and Trayan Nikolov.
