A pro-crypto lawyer, James Murphy, has outlined four potential options the SEC may consider in response to Ripple’s partial legal victory.
 
Will The SEC File For Interlocutory Appeal Against Ripple?
 
The first option involves the SEC filing a request for interlocutory appeal. Since no final judgment has been entered yet, the SEC does not have the unilateral right to appeal. Instead, it would need permission from both Judge Torres and the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to proceed with an interlocutory appeal. 
 
To obtain permission, the SEC must show that the ruling involves a controlling question of law, that there are subst…]]></summary>

Thirty-eight-year-old Kristy Lynn Felkins from Fallon, Nevada, used Bitcoin to pay $5,000 in 2016 to have her ex-husband murdered in order to get a hold of a large life insurance payment.
