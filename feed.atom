In a letter addressed to Judge Kaplan, prosecutors confirmed their plan to seek a superseding indictment to reinstate the allegations of an “illegal campaign finance scheme.” The trial is scheduled for October.
 
The DOJ’s decision comes two weeks after it stated that it couldn’t bring a campaign finance charge against Bankman-Fried due to treaty obligations.
