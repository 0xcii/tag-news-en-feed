        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move aimed at tightening the reins on financial transactions within the crypto space, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) has issued a directive to financial institutions nationwide.
 
This directive calls for an enhanced monitoring mechanism targeting “unlawful” transfers to digital currency exchange providers, underscoring the regulatory body’s resolve to curb financial crimes leveraging digital currencies.
 
 
A Proactive Approach To Financial Security?
 
The FSA’s initiative comes after an analytical report from the National Police Agency, as referred to in the directive, highlighting a worrying trend: a substantial portion of the damages incurred from specialized fraud and unlawful money transfers finds its way into the crypto ecosystem. The FSA noted:

Bitcoin Disapproval Continues
 
Despite the significant success of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) within just one month of trading, which has played a pivotal role in driving BTC’s market capitalization to over a trillion dollars and the total crypto market capitalization to nearly reclaiming the $2 trillion milestone, Gary Gensler has consistently maintained a critical viewpoint towards the dominant cryptocurrency in the market.
 
However, Gensler’s remarks are unsurprising, as he has consistently voiced his disapproval of Bitcoin and the industry.

Bitcoin Has Continued Its Latest Rally With A Break Above $51,500
 
Bitcoin had slumped back under the $49,000 mark just yesterday, prompting many to wonder whether the earlier surge above $50,000 was only temporary.
 
During the past day, however, the coin has sharply moved up and has not only recovered back above $50,000 but has also been exploring new highs for the year, as it has jumped past the $51,500 barrier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to remove custodial risk from your bitcoin holdings, you must take self-custody. Bitcoin custody is determined by whoever has the keys to control the bitcoin—if you aren’t holding the keys to your bitcoin, then someone else is. As the saying goes, not your keys, not your coins.
Once someone decides that they want to hold their bitcoin in self-custody, the next question becomes how to do it. Most people discover early on that hardware wallets are the most secure way to use bitcoin keys. However, the options don’t end with selecting a hardware wallet; you can also choose between singlesig, multisig, and a few other technologies that determine what is required to spend your bitcoin. In this article we will take a look at these options and compare them with one another.
