        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the biggest market-making firms in the crypto industry, Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto, are reportedly scaling back their trading activities in the US due to increased regulatory pressure. This move comes amidst ongoing regulatory uncertainty in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has made it difficult for firms to operate in the market. 
 
 
Is A Crypto Selloff Imminent?
 
Jane Street Group, a major player in markets such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate bonds, has decided to limit its global crypto ambitions due to the regulatory environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: Bitcoin 2023 and Bitcoin Magazine are both operated by BTC Inc.
The “Bitcoin Car,” a 2013 Toyota Prius that was purchased with 1,000 bitcoin, will be showcased at the upcoming Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami Beach. The event will take place from May 18-20, during which the car will be on display. The auction of the Bitcoin Car, being conducted via Scarce.City, a Bitcoin auction site, began on May 10 and will conclude on May 20. The current owners of the car, Devin Konopa and Austin Craig, will be allowing Bitcoin OGs from all over the United States flocking to Bitcoin 2023 to tag the car before its appearance at the conference.

Konopa spoke about the cultural significance of the car, stating that "this Prius represents the growth of public awareness, an acceptance of digital currency, and a significant tipping point in the Bitcoin space." He also expressed his desire to see the car displayed in a museum one day as a symbol of the rise of Bitcoin.
The Prius has been dubbed the "$48M Prius" by the media and the Bitcoin community due to the historical significance of its peak value, a press release announcing the car’s appearance states. Since its purchase, the car has been to over 30 Bitcoin events according to the announcement, and has transported hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash from early Bitcoin ATMs.
The auction for the First Bitcoin Car is expected to generate a great deal of interest among Bitcoin enthusiasts and collectors at the highly anticipated event in Miami Beach. Those who wish to bid on the car can do so by visiting the FirstBitcoinCar.com website, and those who seek to view the car for themselves can get tickets for Bitcoin 2023 at b.tc/conference.]]></summary>

Crypto regulation in the US is becoming stricter, prompting some firms to consider relocation. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong even hinted at a possible relocation during a Fintech conference in London.

A blockchain analytics firm, Glassnode, reported that the year-over-year Bitcoin supply for America had dropped drastically with the formation of a divergence. Conversely, the asset supply spiked higher for the Asian region.

He's also figuring out how to upend what it means to be a music fan. The band launched a Deathbats Club NFT collection in 2021. That is to say: They were early. The lead singer said it was timed to give fans a chance to get comfortable with Web3 technology ahead of the group's 2023 tour, when the NFT holders can use their Deathbats for early access to tickets. M. Shadows also talked to hosts Andrew Hayward and Stephen Graves about AI and bringing Web3 into gaming.]]></summary>

But the tides started to turn because even if exploiting a smart contract nets a bigger payday than a bounty, it comes with a huge drawback. "There's a ton of risk when you engage in this, you know, wantonly criminal behavior and steal $200 million from someone else," he said. "There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>

That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>
