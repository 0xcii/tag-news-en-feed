High Transactional Costs of Converting Rupees
 
The Indian oil ministry recently informed a standing committee of parliament that the country’s attempt to have oil producers accept payment in the local currency has failed.

Why This Critic Is Choosing To Buy
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, XRP critic Cousin Crypto mentioned that he was bidding for the crypto token. Such a move will usually not be expected from him, considering his reservations about XRP. However, the crypto trader is choosing not to let his sentiments cloud his judgment as he believes that XRP could pump soon.
