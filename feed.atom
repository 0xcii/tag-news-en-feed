The orchestrator behind this scam is none other than Martin Shkreli, a controversial figure previously known for his provocative maneuvers in the pharmaceutical industry.
 
The Trump Coin (DJT) Is Fake
 
The intrigue around DJT began when insiders claimed that Barron Trump was involved in the creation of the memecoin, providing early investment opportunities to a select few. This narrative gained traction rapidly within the crypto community, drawing significant attention and speculative investments, as Bitcoinist reported yesterday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former president Donald Trump is doubling down on his pro-Bitcoin stance, arguing that the USA must lead in Bitcoin and crypto or risk falling behind. Trump has emerged as a vocal Bitcoin advocate while campaigning for the 2024 election.
Trump became the first US president to accept Bitcoin lightning payments and oppose central bank digital currencies. On the campaign trail, he has promised to keep regulators away from Bitcoin if elected.
Yesterday in Wisconsin, Trump further declared he will "end Joe Biden's war on crypto" to secure America's future. He added new comments that "We will ensure that the future of crypto and the future of Bitcoin will be made in America, otherwise other countries are going to have it."

This marks a shift. Trump explicitly states that he wants the USA to lead in Bitcoin; otherwise, rivals will surpass it.
Trump's embrace of Bitcoin reflects Bitcoin's game theory. As Bitcoin grows too popular to ban, politicians realize they must support it to court Bitcoin-friendly voters.
The USA risks falling behind in the technological and financial race if it shuns Bitcoin and crypto innovation. Trump understands the USA must lead in this critical new domain.
Whether sincerely supportive or opportunistic, Trump grasps Bitcoin's political capital. He knows backing Bitcoin can win votes, while attacking it risks alienating a passionate base.
Other nations are pursuing pro-Bitcoin policies to attract economic growth and talent. To stay competitive, America must become a welcoming hub for Bitcoin and crypto developments.]]></summary>

The methods employed by these fraudsters are both clever and insidious. One common technique involves the use of slightly misspelled domain names that mimic the official campaign site.
