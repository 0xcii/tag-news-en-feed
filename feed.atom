A recent analysis from Bitining, a crypto educational platform, reveals that Binance currently holds a 43.8% share of the global crypto exchange trade volume.
 
 
This figure, while lower than the 62.3% dominance it enjoyed at the start of 2023, still places it significantly ahead of its competitors, who collectively hold 56.2%.
 
 
Binance remains the dominant exchange by volume.

Matrixport’s analysis, published on January 2, 2023, under the title “Explosive Bitcoin Surge to $50,000 Looms Large in January,” argues that the consolidation observed in Bitcoin’s price towards the end of last year sets the stage for a robust start to 2024. “After the typical mid-to-end December consolidation, Bitcoin is poised to break out on a robust beginning-of-the-year buying flow,” the report states.

All eyes are now on the upcoming decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, slated for January 10.
If the past is any indication, the ruling will have a significant impact on Bitcoin's price, though whether positive or negative remains to be seen.

Proponents of a Bitcoin ETF argue that its approval by the SEC would open the door to a flood of institutional and retail investments, driving the price of Bitcoin to new heights.

Vitalik mentioned that the worst thing that happens on Ethereum is when people lose money. It is, however, worth mentioning that this particular comment came in relation to his earlier remarks about the impact that wars and dictators have on human lives. This was meant to be light-hearted in comparison to the “heavy things” he had just spoken about.

Following a reflective look at his past forecasts, Deutscher shared a thread on X, outlining what he believes will be the key trends and shifts in the crypto sphere for the coming year.
 
Deutscher began his revelation by acknowledging the mixed accuracy of his previous predictions for 2023. He candidly remarked, “Exactly one year ago, at the outset of 2023, I published a thread outlining my crypto predictions for the year. Looking back, I got a lot right – but also a lot wrong.” He highlighted his successful predictions for Coinbase, SOL, and BTC while admitting to miscalculations regarding ETH and being overly pessimistic about the market’s first half in 2023.
