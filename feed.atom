        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-bnb-rebounds-on-monday-as-sol-slips-following-recent-gains/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-10T16:01:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance coin was one of Monday’s biggest gainers, as the token rebounded following a move close to a key support point on Sunday. The move pushed the price near a one-week high, and came as the global crypto market cap fell 0.07% lower as of writing. Solana also dropped, following a recent bull run.
 
Binance Coin (BNB)
 
Binance coin (BNB) was a notable gainer on Monday, as the token rose by nearly 5% to start the trading week.
 
After falling to an intraday low of $232.01 earlier in today’s session, BNB/USD rose to a peak of $244.80.
 
This resulted in BNB hitting its strongest point since last Tuesday, when the token climbed to a high of $246.90.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that this latest rally occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 48.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 49.33, with the next visible point of resistance at 52.00.
 
Should the index reach this point, there is a good chance that BNB will be near $250.00.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
After climbing to a two-month high last week, solana (SOL) was in the red on Monday, falling for a second straight day.
 
SOL/USD hit an intraday low of $20.57, which comes less than 24 hours after price peaked at $21.53.
 
The move appears to be a result of profit taking, since solana reached its highest point since May 6, this past Saturday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it seems that sentiment is still somewhat bullish, as traders opted to reject a breakout below $20.00.
 
As of writing, the token is trading at $21.09, with the 10-day (red) moving average still upward facing.
 
Overall, the recent decline comes following a collision with a ceiling at $22.00.

        <updated>2023-07-10T15:37:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent newsletter, Singapore-based crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital raised the question of whether the introduction of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could lead to price manipulation by institutions, similar to what has happened in the gold market. The bitcoin spot ETF filing by BlackRock and many other institutional giants has created a lot of euphoria in the market, but the manipulation issue has not been addressed much.
 
According to QCP Capital, “Just like BTC, gold is seen as a competitor to the dollar, especially ever since Nixon removed the dollar from the gold standard in 1971. Having full control of gold allows institutions to defend the dollar, especially if they have various vested interests in protecting the greenback.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To position itself as a digital hub amidst global regulatory scrutiny of online assets, the Hong Kong Securities and Investment Institute (HKSI) plans to provide training for virtual asset platforms. Supported by the local regulator Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the HKSI ensures that all new centralized virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong acquire the necessary licenses.
 
It’s worth noting that existing operators and their platforms have until June of the following year to apply for licenses under the newly imposed regulations.

Bitcoin exists for a couple of reasons: As money that anyone, anywhere can use, and as a monetary good that is guaranteed not to be diluted or devalued by a central bank. But it’s also a piece of software that deliberately takes away the power of insiders — no matter if those insiders are large miners or bitcoin whales. 
What we’ve seen in the larger cryptocurrency space over the past few years has been a perversion of those ideas and principles. The fact that the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) is (finally) waking up to those shenanigans is something that was to be expected.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, SHIB looks to be getting back on the radar of the traders. The indicator of interest here is the “whale transaction count,” which measures the total amount of transactions happening on the blockchain that involve the movement of at least $1 million worth of Shiba Inu.
 
Generally, the only investors in the market who are capable of moving such a large number of tokens with single transactions are the whales. Thus, when the value of this metric is high, it means that the whales are making a large number of moves in the market currently.…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-10T12:58:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a recent slip, bitcoin moved back above $30,000 on Monday, ahead of a key week of U.S. economic data, with the headline being the inflation report. Inflation is expected to drop to 3.1% in June, which would be a nearly two-year low. Ethereum also slipped on Monday, remaining below $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the week trading near the $30,000 level, after the price dropped below this point over the weekend.
 
Following a low of $29,985.39 on Sunday, BTC/USD jumped to an intraday high of $30,427.59 in today’s session.
 
The rebound comes as bears rejected a breakout below a recent support point at the $29,900 level.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
BTC has mostly been consolidating for the past four days, which has led to the 10-day (red) moving average shifting direction.
 
After trending upwards in recent weeks, the moving average now looks as though it has flatlined, giving way to a potential downturn in the coming days.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 57.75, marginally below a ceiling at 58.00.
 
Should it fail to break out, there is a good chance that BTC could decline further in the coming days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) continued to trade below $1,900 on Monday, as price is nearly 5% lower than at the same point last week.
 
ETH/USD slid to an intraday bottom at $1,848.78 to start the week, a day after trading nearly $30.00 higher.
 
Overall, this has resulted in ethereum’s 10-day (red) moving average closing in on a downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Should this occur, the first possible target will be a price floor at $1,815, which was last hit on June 30.
 
Price strength is currently at a reading of 50.35, however should it move under an upcoming floor at 48.00, a sell-off will likely occur.

Daniel Keller, CTO at Eminence and an XRPL ambassador, held a poll via Twitter in which the XRP army was able to vote on whether incentives should be introduced. A whopping 78% answered “yes”, possibly in the belief that the XRP Ledger could adopt an on-chain staking mechanism similar to Ethereum.
