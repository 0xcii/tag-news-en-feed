Tokens (NFTs) and Contract for Difference (CFDs) are two financial products

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, three ADA metrics had surged to the highest level for 2023 when the price hit the $0.23 low. The first of these metrics is the “trading volume,” which measures the total amount of Cardano that’s being moved around on the blockchain every day by the users.
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that a large number of tokens of the asset are being transacted on the network right now. Such a trend can be a sign that traders are active in the sector currently.
