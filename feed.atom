Butterfill tweeted an astute analysis, offering a multi-faceted perspective: “Our thoughts on what’s behind the recent Bitcoin price crash,” beginning with an emphasis on the market’s recalibrated expectations concerning SEC’s stance on the approval of a spot ETF. He stated that the crash was probably “prompted by the market realizing that the SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the US isn’t imminent.”
