In fact,  
Revolut aims to offer a fully independent crypto exchange in addition to  
standard digital asset services. The question is, however, whether it will be  
able to compete with the biggest names in the industry.

Brandt, known for his outspoken views and market expertise, has launched a public critique of Gensler, specifically citing his involvement in the MF Global and Peregrine Financial bankruptcies. He alleges that Gensler, then head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), failed to prevent the co-mingling of customer funds in both cases, putting investors at risk.
