Bitcoin Whales Have Participated In Net Accumulation Since March 1st
 
As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment in a post on X, the large BTC holders in the market haven’t been shaken by the recent downturn in the price.
 
The indicator of interest here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total amount of Bitcoin that the various wallet groups in the sector are holding right now.
 
 
Addresses are divided into these wallet groups based on the number of coins they currently carry in their balance. The 1-10 coins cohort, for instance, includes all addresses or investors who own at least 1 and at most 10 BTC.

Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that 83% of Dogecoin holders are currently in profit at its current price level.

left to Bitcoin halving. According to the latest analysis by Bybit, with just 2 million Bitcoins remaining and a daily inflow of $500 million to spot Bitcoin ETFs,

The much-anticipated halving event, which reduces the  
supply of Bitcoins by 50%, is expected to make the digital asset more scarce. Bybit  
highlighted the rapid reduction  of Bitcoin reserves across centralized

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was experiencing a significant drop of nearly 15%, plummeting to a low of $60,660, its lowest level in almost a month.
 
 
Amidst this turbulence, prominent Bitcoin advocate and investor, Samson Mow, has emerged as a beacon of optimism for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Mow, known for his unwavering belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, remains bullish despite the recent downturn.
