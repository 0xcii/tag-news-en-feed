        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum is still working on a complementary plan for parallel EVM, but Bitcoin can be soon expecting its own parallel VM layer 2. 
Let’s firstly understand why Ethereum cannot achieve parallel EVM.
To maintain network consistency and security, EVM has a crucial feature in its design: transactions are executed sequentially. Sequential execution ensures that transactions and smart contracts can be executed in a deterministic order, making it easier to manage and predict the blockchain's state. This design choice prioritizes security, reducing potential complexities and vulnerabilities associated with parallel execution. However, under high loads of transaction requests, this sequential execution can lead to network congestion and delays, similar to a single-lane highway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a bold forecast, Standard Chartered's head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, has predicted that Bitcoin could surge to $150,000 if Donald Trump wins the upcoming U.S. presidential election. "As we approach the U.S. election, I expect $100,000 to be reached and then $150,000 by year-end in the case of a Trump victory," Kendrick stated.

The prediction comes amidst a backdrop of economic indicators and political developments influencing the Bitcoin market. Kendrick highlighted that the next significant driver for Bitcoin's price would be the U.S. election.
Kendrick also noted that Bitcoin could reach a new record over the weekend if the nonfarm payrolls report, to be released on Friday, is favorable. Bitcoin's current all time high, set on March 14, stands at $73,770. A positive jobs report could pave the way for Bitcoin to reach $80,000 later this month, he noted.
The forecast underscores the significant impact political developments can have on the Bitcoin market. With over 50 million Bitcoin and crypto holders in the United States, the outcome of the presidential election is poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future of Bitcoin.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robinhood has agreed to acquire leading Bitcoin and crypto exchange Bitstamp for $200 million in cash, marking a major expansion of its Bitcoin and crypto business. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025.

BREAKING: ROBINHOOD BUYS #BITCOIN AND CRYPTO EXCHANGE BITSTAMP FOR $200 MILLION. pic.twitter.com/Q9LfBDw3Di
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 6, 2024
  
  
  
Founded in 2011, Bitstamp is one of the world's oldest and most established crypto exchanges. It operates across Europe, Asia and the U.S., with over 50 licenses globally. The acquisition will bring Bitstamp's institutional and retail customers under Robinhood's umbrella.
Robinhood aims to leverage Bitstamp's reputation for resilience and trust to bolster its own Bitcoin and crypto offerings. Bitstamp underwent over a decade of market cycles and maintained high-security standards. 
The purchase comes as Robinhood faces scrutiny from the SEC over its crypto division. However, Bitcoin and crypto remain a key driver of growth, with transaction revenue from crypto trading jumping 40% last year. Acquiring an established platform like Bitstamp could significantly expand Robinhood's global reach.
Robinhood general manager Johann Kerbrat said the deal is a "major step in growing our crypto business" and will help Robinhood "expand our footprint outside of the U.S. and welcome institutional customers." Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev says, "We believe crypto will fundamentally reorganize the financial system."
Robinhood has already been offering Bitcoin and crypto trading services in the EU. But buying Bitstamp provides a ready-made base of customers and regulatory licensing across multiple jurisdictions.  As Bitcoin demand increases, the acquisition positions Robinhood to capture growing trading volumes.]]></summary>
