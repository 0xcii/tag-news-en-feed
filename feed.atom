Before now, US lawmakers expressed dissatisfaction with developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In a new bill, the board noted that the Fed has no authority to develop and issue a central bank digital currency, as it may affect the privacy protection of digital asset investors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin was one of Thursday’s biggest gainers, as prices rose by as much as 13% in today’s session. This came despite the global crypto market cap shifting lower, down 1.65% as of writing. Dogecoin was also higher, as the meme coin rebounded from Wednesday’s losses.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) has been one of Thursday’s biggest gainers, as prices rose by as much as 13% in today’s session.
 
LTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $91.70 in today’s session, a day after falling to a low of $79.95.
 
As a result of the move, LTC climbed to its strongest point since March 3, when the token reached a peak of $95.49.
 
 
Overall, the move has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average closer to an upwards crossover with the 25-day (blue) moving average.
 
Although some will be anticipating a cross, there appears to be a hurdle in place, which comes in the form of a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 55.35, which is marginally below the aforementioned resistance zone at 56.00.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was also higher in today’s session, as the meme coin rose to a five-day high.
 
Following a low of $0.07213 on Wednesday, DOGE/USD rose to a peak of $0.07819 earlier today.
 
The move saw DOGE rebound from yesterday’s losses, hitting its highest point since last Saturday in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s surge has sent the 10-day (red) moving average to the brink of a cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
This typically is a sign of upcoming rallies, which like with LTC, will have to come once the RSI breaks free of a current point of resistance.
 
Price strength is currently tracking at 51.38, which is slightly below a ceiling at the 52.00 mark.

Crypto Futures Market Has Seen A Large Amount Of Liquidations Today
 
According to data from CoinGlass, the crypto sector has seen a largescale liquidation event in the past day. A “liquidation” occurs when a derivative exchange has to forcefully close a contract on the futures market because the holder has accumulated losses that have eaten away a specific percentage of their initial collateral (this percentage can differ from platform to platform).
 
In the crypto market, mass liquidation events, where a large number of traders get their contracts closed at once, aren’t an uncommon sight. There are mainly two reasons behind this.
