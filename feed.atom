        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alvaro Fernandez, the Chief Operations Officer (COO) at Lumoz, has stated that while zero-knowledge rollups have demonstrated exceptional security and scalability, the technology is still not user-friendly. To address this issue, networks should opt for ZK Rollups-as-a-Service (ZK-RaaS) because this simplifies the creation process for a single ZK-Rollup. This makes them “more accessible for developers and projects to use,” Fernandez added.

In his written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News via Telegram, Fernandez argued that by offering what he called “a seamless experience” ZK-RaaS can also quicken the “implementation of secure and scalable networks.” While ZK-RaaS are believed to be more secure, Optimistic Rollups-as-a-Service, on the other hand,…]]></summary>
