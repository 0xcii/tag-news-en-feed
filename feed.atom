three retail investors is more likely to trust a financial influencer (or  
finfluencer) than someone from their immediate circle. It's no wonder that the  
internet is full of experts offering their help in making money. Trading  
platforms and cryptocurrency exchanges are well aware of this, as affiliate  
marketing has long been an important way to acquire new customers.
Now, one of  
them has decided to take it a step further by introducing a new model of

Alderoty, has criticized the United States Securities and Exchange Commission  
(SEC) for repeatedly using the term “crypto asset security.” He argues that the

mislead judges by using the phrase.
Ripple Lawyer Slams SEC
The criticism follows a recent SEC filing  
on August 30. In the filing, the SEC warned that it might challenge any  
proposal by the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX to use stablecoins to repay  
creditors. The SEC noted that FTX’s portfolio includes “crypto asset  
securities.” Alderoty sees this as part of an effort by the SEC to insert  
legally unsupported terminology into legal arguments.

However, the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) upcoming decision to cut interest rates could spell further trouble for the largest cryptocurrency on the market.
 
September And Bitcoin Price Forecast
 
According to a recent report from Bitfinex Alpha, this month’s interest rate decisions could significantly impact Bitcoin’s short-term volatility and long-term trajectory. Since early August, Bitcoin has gained over 32 percent, driven largely by traders anticipating dovish comments from the Federal Reserve.
