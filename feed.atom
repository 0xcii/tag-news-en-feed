31-year-old Founder of the Oyster Protocol that powers Pearl (PRL) tokens, has  
pleaded guilty to allegations of tax evasion to the tune of $5.5 million. US  
prosecutors disclosed on Thursday, noting that he has agreed to pay restitution  
of at least the same amount.
Elmaani, who was arraigned  
before US District Judge Collen McMahon, also admitted that he secretly minted  
and sold PRL tokens, causing the price of the token to drop sharply, Damian  
Williams, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new Launchpad will provide those looking to inscribe directly onto Bitcoin an easy way to build their collection.
Magic Eden, an NFT platform, has announced the opening of a Launchpad to inscribe collections using the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin. 
This comes shortly after the platform's launch of an Ordinals marketplace, which has helped Magic Eden become the “top marketplace for trading Bitcoin inscriptions,” according to the press release.
The press release describes the company’s goal of offering a safe and secure platform for creators to launch their collections, with the first collection launch scheduled for April 7, 2023. According to the release, the platform has already served over 500 creators and raised over $150 million on their behalf.
Zhuoxun Yin, COO, and co-founder of Magic Eden commented on the announcement, "We're excited to expand our creator capabilities to Bitcoin and offer easy ways for creators to get started and launch... With Ordinals, content can be preserved forever, and we're proud to be helping creators and the Ordinals community grow together." 
Magic Eden's move to provide creators with a Launchpad for Bitcoin inscriptions comes at a time when Bitcoin inscriptions have seen a significant uptick in popularity throughout Q1 2023, as the press release describes. 
The Ordinals protocol allows users to insert arbitrary data onto specific UTXOs, effectively enabling immutable NFTs built directly into the Bitcoin blockchain. Since the launch of the protocol, its impacts have been debated. That being said, almost 1,000,000 pieces of data have been inscribed onto the blockchain already as of the time of writing, and there are no signs of that stopping.]]></summary>

Reddit launched these Non-fungible tokens on Polygon’s blockchain on April 5th, which led to speculation among users that these NFTs would sell out quickly.
 
A collector who had acquired the first and second generation of avatars expressed their anticipation, stating that the latest drop could potentially sell out “within minutes.”
 
 
Simultaneously, other users commended Reddit’s marketing efforts, which successfully transformed the perception of non-fungible tokens, converting those who previously stood against NFTs to become neutral or in favor of them.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-extends-declines-on-thursday-falling-by-nearly-9/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-06T15:27:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was one of Thursday’s biggest movers, as the meme coin fell by as much as 9%. The decline comes as market sentiment begins to shift, following huge gains to start the week. Litecoin was also in the red today, with prices hovering near the $90.00 level.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) fell for a third consecutive session on Thursday, as market sentiment shifted bearish, following strong gains to start the week.
 
DOGE/USD dropped to a low of $0.08857 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24-hours after trading at a high of $0.09804.
 
The meme coin rose to a four-month high earlier in the week, after Twitter changed its logo to a cartoon image of Doge.
 
 
Since then, traders have appeared to abandon earlier long positions, instead opting to secure profits.
 
As a result of this latest decline in price, the relative strength index (RSI) has now fallen below a long-term floor at 60.00.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 59.59, with a strong chance of further declines.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Another notable mover on Thursday was litecoin (LTC), which fell towards the $90.00 level.
 
Following a high of $94.44 in yesterday’s session, LTC/USD dropped to a bottom at $90.22 earlier in the day.
 
Overall, it appears that this decline was a result of upwards momentum easing, as the token approached a key price point of $95.00.
 
 
In addition to this, the RSI also failed to break out of its own ceiling at 57.00, giving way to a resurgence of bearish activity.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 52.26, which is the weakest point for the index since March 31.
 
A floor at 51.00 is seemingly the target for bears, and should the point be reached, there is a good chance that LTC will be below $90.00.
