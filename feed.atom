        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is looking to enter into the $65,000 price terrain again amidst price volatility in the past 24 hours. The latest numbers from two different metrics suggest this could become a reality soon and Bitcoin could be on track to going on a price rally. As noted by a crypto analyst on social media, the Bitcoin funding rate and basis points to a “leg up.” 
 
Bitcoin Is Getting Ready
 
According to a post on social media by Will Clemente, a popular crypto analyst, both the funding rate and 3-month annualized basis for Bitcoin are starting to cool off after briefly reaching negative readings in the past few weeks. What this means is that long-position trades for the asset are starting to dominate as investors regain confidence in its potential price action in the coming weeks.

Evolution Of Account Abstraction On Ethereum
 
Ethereum’s account model includes two primary types: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts. EOAs are controlled by private keys and have limited capabilities and security features, which restrict their use in more complex transactions typically reserved for smart contracts.
