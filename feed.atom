Finally Challenges DCG in Court
According  
to the New York-based exchange, thousands of its users signed up for Gemini Earn Program under which  
they lent out their digital assets to Genesis in order to earn profit. However,

Despite challenging conditions due to extreme heat and high power demand in Texas, the firm was able to mine 460 BTC while significantly leveraging its power strategy. 
 
Riot’s Vertically Integrated Structure
 
According to the report, the company produced 460 BTC in June 2023. The average Bitcoin produced per day was 15.3 BTC, a 32% decrease from May 2023, but a 9% increase compared to June 2022.
 
 
Riot held 7,250 BTC at the end of June 2023, a 1% increase from May 2023, and a 9% increase compared to June 2022. A lot of this growth is attributed to the power strategy which the blockchain adopted not too long ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we wrap up the initial six months of 2023, the Bitcoin network inches closer to a significant milestone — the impending block reward halving, which lies just under 300 days ahead. Projections indicate that this event is slated to take place between April 21 and 27, 2024, leading to a substantial reduction of 50% in the earnings of mining participants. Such a development is bound to bring about a significant transformation in the landscape of mining distribution, as miners will witness a substantial decrease in the amount of bitcoin they receive compared to previous cycles.
 
Balancing Act: Can Bitcoin’s Halving Strike a Sustainable Equation for Miners and Network Security?

Organized by Fedi and Stak, the hackathon will take place remotely on the BOLT.FUN and Replit platforms from July 1 to July 31, 2023. Participants will have the opportunity to engage in workshops, coding sessions, tutorials and mentorships led by industry experts from both the AI and Bitcoin ecosystems.
The focus of the hackathon is to explore the integration of decentralized technologies with generative AI to promote access and adoption on a global scale. The organizers believe that this combination can empower individuals and communities, bridging the gap between different regions and creating opportunities for those in challenging environments.
"We’re at a critical moment in the development of generative AI that will help determine whether it is controlled by centralisers, censors, and legacy institutions, or by free and empowered people and communities," said the organizers in a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.
The event is presented in collaboration with Replit and has garnered sponsorship from companies such as Hivemind Ventures, Spirit of Satoshi, Zebedee and Prem. Additional support comes from Voltage, Lightning Labs, Blockstream, Alby, Bolt.Fun, Lightspark and Base58.
Companies interested in sponsoring projects and prizes can still participate, and those who wish to compete or collaborate can find registration information and updates on the Ai4ALL Hackathon website.
With the collaborative efforts of AI and Bitcoin communities, the hackathon aims to foster innovation and promote the accessibility of AI technology and Bitcoin worldwide.]]></summary>

This is coming after BTC mining stocks listed in the United States witnessed substantial growth this year, with their value more than doubling after enduring a downturn in the crypto market in 2022.
 
This remarkable resurgence has been attributed to two primary factors. The first factor is the robust performance of bitcoin prices, which is because of an enhanced investor sentiment resulting from the recent filing of exchange-traded-fund (ETF) applications by prominent institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity. These filings have instilled confidence in the market and contributed to the positive trajectory of bitcoin prices.

Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rallied for a second straight session on Friday, as the token rose above a ceiling at $20.00
 
SOL/USD hit an intraday peak at $21.22 earlier in today’s session, which came in response to the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.
 
As a result of the surge, solana hit its strongest point since June 5, when the price peaked at $22.06
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a resistance level of 65.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 68.30, which is its highest level since April 14.
 
The next visible point of resistance appears to be at the 70.00 level, and in the event it reaches this point, it is likely that SOL will hit $22.50.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) rebounded in today’s session, as the cryptocurrency snapped a three-day losing streak.
 
After falling to a low of $0.278 on Thursday, ADA/USD jumped to a high of $0.2874 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw cardano rebound from a one-week low, as bulls reentered the market close to a floor at $0.2875.
 
 
One of the catalysts of this rally was the 14-day RSI, which bounced on its own support point at the 43.00 zone.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 45.25, a point that is marginally below a ceiling at 46.00.
 
Earlier gains have somewhat eased as a result of this, with ADA now trading at $0.2842.
