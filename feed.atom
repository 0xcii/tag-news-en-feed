        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have suffered market crashes today after the Bitcoin price crash. Both of these meme coins have seen their prices fall more than 7% already, leaving investors bewildered as to what is causing the crash. All roads actually lead to Bitcoin and the massive sell-offs that have dominated the leading cryptocurrency.
 
Bitcoin Price sends Shiba Inu And Dogecoin Spiraling
 
While the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu price have been dropping, they are actually following the lead of Bitcoin, which has seen a lot of sell-offs recently. Bitcoin’s price drop to $57,000 was triggered by sell-offs from both the US and German government, causing the price to continue to drop.

Crypto analyst Daan Crypto hinted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin experienced this recent price decline to close the CME gap around the $60,000 range. The CME gap is the difference between BTC’s price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures market between when the market closed on Friday and reopened on Monday.
