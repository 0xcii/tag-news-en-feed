        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The decision to extradite Do Kwon to either the US or  
South Korea has been returned to the High Court after the appeal by the  
Terraform Labs’ Co-Founder, and that of his lawyers was granted by an appellate court  
in Montenegro.
Kwon's Appeal Granted
Montenegrin news outlet Vijesti reported today  
(Friday) that the country’s court of appeals accepted the arguments from Kwon’s  
lawyers. This action canceled a previous decision by the High Court and sent  
the case back for retrial. This move represents the latest legal strategy by  
Kwon’s team to postpone his extradition to either the U.S. or South Korea,  
where he faces multiple criminal charges.
The initial ruling from the High Court in Podgorica on  
April 8, 2024, determined that Kwon, a South Korean national, could be  
extradited for prosecution. However, the Court of Appeal found that this  
decision lacked decisive facts. Specifically, the High Court failed to provide  
valid reasons for its ruling, merely quoting an earlier decision by the Supreme  
Court without adequate explanation.
The Appellate Court highlighted the necessity of a clear  
decision based on legal and factual issues.  When multiple countries request the  
extradition of the same individual, specific criteria guide the decision. These  
criteria are detailed in various international agreements, including the  
European Convention on Extradition and the 1901 convention between Serbia and the  
United States. The first-instance court had not reportedly adequately examined  
these factors in Kwon’s case.
The High Court will now determine the case, ensuring  
Kwon's consent to extradition was voluntary, informed, and irrevocable.  Montenegro’s High Court now stands at a  
crossroads. The upcoming decision will determine whether Do Kwon will face  
justice in the United States or South Korea.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Yesterday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally gave the green light on all eight Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were awaiting approval.
 
Spot ETFs are basically investment vehicles that provide a way to gain indirect exposure to ETH’s price movements without actually owning any tokens.
