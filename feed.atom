As Bitcoinist reported, the dispute ended with Schwartz ignoring his counterpart while Wright threatened to submit a scientific paper on XRP to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as support in the lawsuit.
 
After a brief lull in the fight, the verbal dispute found a revival over the last two days. Wright, the leading figure behind Bitcoin SV (BSV), responded to a screenshot of a years-old tweet from Schwartz in which the Ripple CTO stated that Wright is not the inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.

This increase in crypto mining can be attributed to the Federation’s push to legalize the use of crypto as a means to conduct international trade. 
 
The Russian energy minister has admitted that the industry’s rising need for electricity may necessitate the installation of additional power plants in Siberia.
 
Russia has been the subject of controversy both domestic and international since the start of its “special military operation” in Ukraine. 
 
The country, already sanctioned by the European Union and the United States, now has international assets seized and its banking system cut from the SWIFT protocol.
