        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Per a report from crypto news outlet The Block, crypto exchange Coinbase will halt trading operations with the Binance-branded stablecoin, BUSD. The digital asset has been heavily scrutinized following the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Wells Notice against its issuer, Paxos.
 
 
Coinbase Succumbs To The Pressure?
 
As Bitcoinist has been reporting, Paxos was accused by the SEC of allegedly violating investor protection laws when issuing Binance USD (BUSD). The Commission claims that BUSD, and many other tokens in the crypto ecosystem, is a security.
 
Therefore, Paxos allegedly needed to register the product with the SEC. This legal action from the U.S. regulator forced the crypto firm to cut ties with its long-term partner, crypto exchange Binance, and to stop issuing BUSD.

While the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) opinion on the industry might not be the former, it is also not that far away from the latter. On Sunday, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva in an interview with Bloomberg expressed the organization’s stance on the cryptocurrency market. 
 
Crypto Ban Should Not Be Taken Off The Table
 
In the interview, Georgieva noted the IMF is firmly behind the idea of regulating the crypto market. She stated, “We are very much in favor of regulating the world of digital money.” Adding that this objectiv…]]></summary>

What are the best multisig wallets to store bitcoin
Your Bitcoin wallet is the access to your digital funds and should be kept secure and private at all times. Online threats like malware programs, hacks and phishing attacks are always lurking behind the screen, and so is the risk of losing your own private keys, which could lead to losing your funds with no way to recover them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu started the week trading marginally higher, despite cryptocurrencies mostly consolidating on Feb. 27. At the time of writing, the global market cap is currently up 0.83%, as volatility has intensified. Litecoin also rebounded on Monday, hitting a four-day high.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) continued to move away from a recent support point to start the week, as prices rose marginally higher on Monday.
 
Following a low $0.0000124 on Sunday, SHIB/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.00001307 earlier today.
 
This move comes as the meme coin bounced from its long-term price floor at the $0.00001230 mark.
 
 
Overall, SHIB is down 7% in the last seven days, and this comes following a downward cross of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) of 14 days has also failed to move past a ceiling at the 52.00 mark
 
The index is now tracking at 50.44, which comes after bulls rejected a breakout of a floor at 49.00.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
In addition to SHIB, litecoin (LTC) also climbed higher, hitting a four-day high in the process.
 
LTC/USD moved to a peak of $95.58 to start the week, after ending the weekend trading at a bottom of $93.79.
 
As a result of today’s gains, the token is now trading at its strongest point since last week, Thursday.
 
 
The initial move came following a breakout of a resistance point of 50.00 on the RSI indicator.
 
As of writing, the index is hovering slightly above this mark, with a current reading of 50.43.
 
LTC has since declined, and is now at $94.64, which appears to be a result of price strength tracking near a ceiling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Web3 and crypto go mainstream, several decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have fallen victim to hacking exploitations, losing millions of dollars in assets to criminals. While DeFi projects seek ways to avoid this menace, the crypto platform LendHub has succumbed to the same fate, losing $6 million in digital assets to an exploit in January.
 
The latest reports revealed that OFAC-sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash remains an escape route for bad actors who want to launder illegal funds. Blockchain security platforms, Beosin and PeckShield, reported that LendHub exploiters have moved $3.85 million in ETH into Tornado Cash.
 
Both firms shared the update via Twitter, noting the hack suspects sent about 2,415 ETH worth nearly $3.85 million to Tornado Cash.

After resigning from his position in 2019, Kano still maintains a notable influence on BitFlyer, given his stake as the firm’s largest shareholder.
