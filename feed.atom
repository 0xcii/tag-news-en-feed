Ethereum Has Declined Under The $1,600 Mark Recently
 
Around the start of this month, Ethereum enjoyed some sharp upward momentum as the cryptocurrency reached the $1,750 level. Since that peak, however, the coin has struggled, as its price has now declined again under the $1,600 mark.
 
Yesterday, ETH even retested a brief $1,550, but the asset quickly found a rebound and has so far held above the level, as the chart below shows.
 

 
 
The bounce has been small, however, meaning that Ethereum could be in danger of making another retest of the $1,550 level in the coming days. Something that may hold hints regarding if more decline is coming could be the investor…]]></summary>

And could this bigger cycle reflect the way humans adopt new technologies? And is it possible we have seen something similar before with another technology like the internet? In this article, we will be diving into a new theory that suggests that Bitcoin is moving through a larger 16-year cycle which can help us predict the direction of the Bitcoin price in the coming years. 
The Regular 4 Year Cycle
Bitcoin tends to go through 4-year cycles which are divided into 2 parts, the uptrend and the downtrend. A regular 4-year cycle consists of a 3-year uptrend followed by a 1-year downtrend also known as a bear market. So far Bitcoin h…]]></summary>

cryptocurrency exchange FTX enters its second week, his legal team has sought  
permission from Judge Lewis Kaplan to cross-examine Gary Wang, the Co-Founder of  
FTX, about the legal advice he received regarding loans obtained from Alameda  
Research. 
In a letter addressed to Judge Kaplan yesterday (Monday), prosecutors  
have already questioned Wang about the substantial loans he allegedly received  
from the hedge fund, which he used for venture investments and to buy a house in the  
Bahamas. SBF's defense argues that Wang believed these loans were legitimate  
and had been structured by lawyers. This perspective aims to challenge the idea  
that these loans were intended to conceal the source of the funds.

Speculation Abounds as Alameda  
Faces Questions over USDT Redemptions
During  
the peak of the cryptocurrency market bull run in 2021, the total value of USDT  
creation exceeded Alameda's recorded assets. This has led to speculation about  
how Alameda managed such significant redemptions.
Grogan  
also puts forward that a substantial portion of USDT redemptions ordered by FTX

XRP, has been one of the most carefully followed cases in the cryptocurrency

The SEC's  
Allegations in Context
The SEC's case  
against Ripple revolves around whether XRP, Ripple's digital asset, should be

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated recent losses on Tuesday, as focus shifts to Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. Traders will look for guidance from the report, to see the Fed’s stance on the economy, after opting to keep rates unchanged last month. Ethereum remains below $1,700 in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade below the $28,000 level on Tuesday, ahead of the release of last month’s FOMC minutes.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $27,715.85 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after hitting a low of $27,302.56.
 
Overall, although mid-term momentum appears to be bullish, bears seem to be looking to hit the $27,000 mark in the short-term.
 
 
The relative strength index (RSI) of 14 days remains on a downward trend, with a current reading at 54.95.
 
This comes as price strength attempts to find a floor, following a move away from a resistance level of 60.00.
 
Currently, BTC is trading at $27,518.86, however volatility will likely increase as we near tomorrow’s economic release.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) remained in the red, following the recent decision by the Ethereum Foundation to trade 1,700 tokens.
 
After a high of $1,596.97 to start the week, ETH/USD retreated to a low of $1,553.01 late in yesterday’s session.
 
This saw the cryptocurrency hit a one-month low, prompting bulls to buy the dip, pushing price to a current reading of $1,580.44.
 
 
From the chart, it seems that the recent decline has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average close to a downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In the event that this occurs, there will likely be further sell-offs, with ethereum almost certainly falling below $1,500.
