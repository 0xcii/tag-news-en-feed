Renowned crypto analysts, Miles Deutscher and Layergg, have provided a granular outlook on the tokens and trends poised to make headlines. Here’s a deeper dive into their analyses:
 
Bitcoin: On the Verge Of Breaking New Ground
 
Miles Deutscher has underscored the resilience and bullish momentum of Bitcoin (BTC), which is inching closer to surpassing its all-time high. “The recovery post-dip has been exceptionally strong, and structurally, Bitcoin looks poised for significant gains. The previous high at $73.8k is the major resistance level to watch,” Deutscher notes. This sentiment reflects the growing investor confidence in Bitcoin as it continues to demonstrate stre…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most people who understand bitcoin know that there are two kinds of bitcoin. One is bitcoin, the asset which has a fixed supply and is quite volatile, and the second kind of Bitcoin, the network and protocol that maintains an immutable ledger that has never been hacked and is bullet proof, bomb proof and tank proof. It is my opinion that too much focus is placed on the asset and not nearly enough on the network, protocol and immutable ledger. 
While listening to a recent podcast Peter McCormack had with Dhruv Bansal they discussed the network and protocol in a new way. 
I really liked Dhruv’s framing of how to view the fixed supply of bitcoin. The two versions can be simplified as follows:

In an interview with CNBC, Garlinghouse predicted that the total market capitalization of the crypto market could double by the end of 2024, reaching a staggering $5 trillion.
 
 
“I’ve been around this industry for a long time, and I’ve seen these trends come and go,” Garlinghouse said. “I’m very optimistic. I think the macro trends, the big picture things like the ETFs, they’re driving for the first time real institutional money.” 
 
This bullish outlook hinges on several key factors, including the recent arrival of the first US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the upcoming bitcoin halving event.

Predicts “$170000 for this cycle.” 🚀 pic.twitter.com/0uE4EAmwgS
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 8, 2024
  
  
  
Scaramucci has been a vocal Bitcoin proponent, with Skybridge investing heavily in Bitcoin. He cited increasing mainstream and institutional adoption as key drivers of Bitcoin's growth.
The prominent financier and former White House Communications Director highlighted the major impact of SEC-approved Bitcoin spot ETFs in unlocking billions in new investments this year. He compared the over $10 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows in Q1 favourably to the slower adoption of early gold ETFs.
Scaramucci also discussed the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will reduce daily supply and potentially dramatically impact prices. He believes the market has not priced in the halving, predicting a supply squeeze.
Although volatile, Scaramucci stressed Bitcoin's inflation-hedging ability over a 4-year investment horizon, touting its digital gold narrative. He sees potential for Bitcoin's market cap to reach 50% of gold's valuation.
Scaramucci has been an avid Bitcoin proponent, with Skybridge taking an early institutional interest in Bitcoin. The firm led a high-profile push to offer Bitcoin exposure in 401(k) retirement plans, underscoring its commitment.
Despite some mainstream scepticism over the years, Scaramucci has maintained a bullish long-term outlook on Bitcoin as an emerging digital store of value. He cites generational wealth transfers and Bitcoin-friendly demographics as setting the stage for massive growth.
Scaramucci also touched on the FTX collapse, its impact, regulatory issues, and his optimism regarding the Bitcoin industry's future maturation.]]></summary>

Bitcoin Halving And Its Influence On Floor Prices Of Mining Machines
 
The halving is a periodic event on the Bitcoin network where the block rewards received by the miners for successfully solving a block are permanently cut in half. This event automatically goes through every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years.
 
The reason the halving exists is that the block rewards serve as the only way to introduce new BTC tokens into circulation, so by periodically slashing them in half, the cryptocurrency’s production rate can be diminished, and thus, its inflation can be controlled.
