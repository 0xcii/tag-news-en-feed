is historically one of the worst months for Bitcoin (BTC) and the  
cryptocurrency market. This year, however, the oldest digital asset bucked the  
trend, rising by over 7% and defending the psychological level of $60,000. The  
lack of a clear direction for another consecutive month caused investor  
activity to decline significantly, and with it, the volumes of the top 10  
largest crypto exchanges. On average, they shrank by 20%.
Spot Volume of Leading  
Crypto Exchanges at Lowest Since November 2023
According  
to the latest analysis by Finance Magnates Intelligence, the total spot

Bitcoin Has Now Recovered To The $66,000 Level
 
The past day has been a great time for Bitcoin investors as the price has shown a sharp recovery surge, which has taken it to the $66,000 level for the first time since the end of last month.
 
 
The below chart shows what the asset’s recent price action has been like.
 
 
The graph shows that this 6% surge in the last 24 hours means that Bitcoin is now not too far from surpassing the high from September. Breaking that top would take the asset to the highest level since July.
