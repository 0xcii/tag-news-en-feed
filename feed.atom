Inflation in the US Remains High, Causing Uncertainty in Markets
 
Inflation in the United States exceeded expectations among analysts and economists for January 2023. The U.S. Labor Department released the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Feb. 14, which measures the value of goods and services across the country. From December 2022 to January 2023, the rate dropped from 6.5% to 6.4%. However, over the 12-month period, prices rose by 0.5%.

Elon Musk Tweets Cause Dogecoin To Jump 5%
 
This past weekend saw the completion of the Super Bowl LVII, which saw the iconic return of legendary singer Rihanna. During this event, billionaire Elon Musk was spotted with Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and CEO of News Corporation, and the owner of Fox News.
 
 
Responding to a tweet that included a picture of the pair at the Super Bowl asking users what they thought they were talking about, Elon Musk said they were talking about “Dogecoin.” As always, once this tweet went live,…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-sol-rebounds-trx-up-for-fifth-straight-session/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-14T16:42:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana was one of Tuesday’s notable movers, as the token rebounded from losses to start the week. The move comes despite U.S. inflation figures missing expectations. Consumer prices came in at 6.4%, higher than the 6.2% many had forecasted. Tron rose for a fifth consecutive session on Tuesday.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rose by as much as 5% on Tuesday, as prices climbed back above a recent support level.
 
SOL/USD surged to an intraday high of $21.70 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after trading at a bottom of $19.87.
 
Today’s move saw the token reenter its $20.00 price floor, after a failed breakout attempt to start the week.
 
 
Recent momentum in solana has been largely bearish, and comes following a downwards crossover of the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
However, bulls have moved to halt any further sell-offs, as the relative strength index (RSI) maintained a floor at 42.00
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 47.46, with the 50.00 mark the next visible point of resistance.
 
 
Tron (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) climbed higher for a fifth straight session on Tuesday, breaking out of a recent ceiling in the process.
 
Following a low of $0.06414 to start the week, TRX/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.06638 earlier in the day.
 
Tuesday’s surge pushed tron to its highest point since last Thursday, which comes after prices broke out of a ceiling at $0.06565.
 
 
Looking at the chart, overall sentiment in TRX has largely been bullish in recent weeks, with moving averages trending upwards.
 
This may be tested in upcoming days, with the RSI, which is currently tracking at 61.53, edging close to a ceiling at 63.00.
 
Previous bulls could look to secure gains as we approach this point, in turn giving way for sellers to re-enter the market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two civil lawsuits, stemming from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried will be paused until his criminal proceedings are complete.
 
US Attorney Requests Pause on SEC and CFTC Lawsuits to Prevent ‘Judicial Overlap’
 
According to the latest decision by a New York judge presiding over the criminal case of Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of FTX, the two lawsuits filed by the top two financial regulators in the U.S. will be put on hold. Bankman-Fried was indicted by a federal grand jury in New York after his arrest, and the SEC and CFTC also filed charges against the former FTX CEO. The SEC complaint alleges that “Bankman-Fried orchestrated a years-long fraud” dating back to the creation of FTX.
 
The CFTC alleges that customer deposits at FTX, including both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, were “appropriated by Alameda for its own use” throughout the relevant period. This week, Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, filed a motion to stay and asked the government entities to pause the lawsuits until the criminal case is settled. Williams argued that pausing the two cases would prevent “judicial overlap” and that the criminal case in Manhattan would have a “significant impact” on both lawsuits.
 
 
The New York judge deferred the SEC and CFTC cases until the trial in Manhattan concludes. Bankman-Fried’s trial in Manhattan is scheduled to begin on Oct. 3, 2023. The FTX co-founder is charged with eight financial crimes, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission and commit campaign finance violations.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed its plans to sue the blockchain firm. Also, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) ordered Paxos to stop issuing BUSD tokens.
 
In a new development, the SEC now targets crypto companies, even those with operational licenses. The regulator is working on a new proposal this week to determine the type of products and services digital assets firms will offer.
