US District Judge Jed Rakoff, presiding over the case in Manhattan, sided with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a lawsuit stemming from the downfall of the TerraUSD and Luna currencies.
 
Terraform Labs Heads To Trial 
 
According to a Reuters report, the judge’s ruling also denied summary judgment to both parties on the SEC’s fraud claims, setting the stage for a trial scheduled for January 29, 2024. 
 
However, Rakoff dismissed the SEC’s claims that the defendants illegally o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The prices of Shiba Inu and PEPE, although there has been movement in both of these assets, have not performed as well as expected. This could be attributed to the muted performance that Ethereum, the parent network of both assets, have put on recently, and thus, they have followed in its footsteps. However, as Ethereum begins to see better upside, things could change for both of these assets according to one analyst.
 
Watch Out For Shiba Inu As Ethereum Begins To Break Out
 
Ethereum has started moving up again and is currently trading above $2,400 at the time of this writing. Naturally, crypto investors expect its ecosystem tokens to follow the same path, and one of those is Shiba Inu, as pseudonymous crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo explains.

        <updated>2023-12-29T18:05:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In light of the ongoing dialogue around Binance’s removal of privacy coins, the cryptocurrency exchange Okx has declared the removal of various spot trading pairs linked to privacy tokens such as monero, zcash, and dash. Okx attributes its decision to remove these offerings to “feedback from users” along with the exchange’s established guidelines for delisting.
 
Privacy Tokens Take a Hit: Okx Joins Binance in Major Delisting Wave
 
Once more, privacy coins face removals as regulatory and compliance requirements intensified significantly throughout 2023. Okx revealed the removal of 20 trading pairs, set to cease operation after Jan. 5, 2024. Two days prior on Dec. 27, Okx halted deposits for ZEN, XMR, CAPO, DASH, FSN, CVP, ZKS, and ZEC. The suspension of withdrawals for these coins is slated for March 5, 2024.
 
“In order to maintain a robust spot trading environment, we constantly monitor the performance of all listed trading pairs and review their listing qualifications on a regular basis,” the exchange details. “Based on feedback from users and the Okx Token Delisting / Hiding Guideline, we will be delisting several trading pairs that do not fulfill our listing criteria.”
 
 
Advocates of privacy are expressing discontent with the delisting moves by Okx and Binance. Conversely, some argue that they are indifferent and that certain privacy coins will continue to thrive regardless of support from exchanges.
 

 
Following the announcement, a significant dip occurred in the value of many privacy coins on Friday, with the entire privacy coin market declining over 6% against the U.S. dollar. XMR fell 3.6%, ZEC decreased by 11.3%, and DASH lost 9% in a 24-hour period.

        <updated>2023-12-29T16:47:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VanEck, a prominent investment management firm, has unveiled a interesting new Bitcoin commercial, stirring excitement and speculation within the Bitcoin community. The release comes amidst mounting anticipation surrounding the possible approval of Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The commercial, showcases a high-quality production recorded at PubKey, a Bitcoin bar in New York City. "All Bitcoiners in NYC need to make the pilgrimage to PubKey if they haven’t checked it out yet," VanEck said.



This move by VanEck appears to be a prelude to the imminent decision on the much-anticipated Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Industry analysts interpret this release as an attempt to not only capture public attention but also to bolster confidence in Bitcoin-related financial products.
The commercial’s timing aligns with VanEck's continued efforts to secure regulatory approval for a Bitcoin ETF, signaling their readiness to enter the market should approval be granted. The SEC has been under increasing pressure to greenlight a Spot Bitcoin ETF, which would open the door for institutional and more retail investors to access Bitcoin exposure via traditional investment avenues.
As the Bitcoin community eagerly awaits the SEC’s decision, VanEck’s bold marketing move has ignited conversations, fueling optimism about the integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial services. The commercial aims to resonate with both seasoned Bitcoin enthusiasts and newcomers, emphasizing the potential significance of BTC in reshaping global finance.]]></summary>

As explained by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the Coinbase Premium Gap has been leading the BTC price during the recent price range.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pancakeswap community has sanctioned a governance vote to eliminate 300 million CAKE tokens from the crypto asset’s total supply. Records indicate that a substantial 97.88% of community votes supported the reduction of 300 million CAKE, decreasing the total supply from 750 million to 450 million CAKE tokens. 
 
Near-Unanimous Vote Cuts CAKE Supply
 
On Dec. 21, 2023, the Pancakeswap community received a governance proposal to deduct 300 million CAKE tokens from the total crypto asset supply. Voting commenced on Thursday and concluded on Friday, Dec. 29, 2023, culminating in the community’s endorsement of the supply cut.
 
A resounding 97.88% of the community voted in favor of the proposal, with a mere 2.12% opposing it. The action will reduce the supply from 750 million CAKE to 450 million. “With a current circulating supply of 388M CAKE, the Kitchen believes this new and lower cap will be sufficient to gain market share across all chains and sustain the VECAKE model,” stated the original proposal.
 
Following the governance vote, Pancakeswap’s CAKE surged 42.6% against the U.S. dollar over the previous week and achieved an over 62% increase for the month. Nonetheless, CAKE experienced a slight dip of about 2.4% against the greenback in the past day. Currently, CAKE boasts a market capitalization of $872 million, representing 0.05% of the total $1.75 trillion crypto economy.
 
 
Currently standing as the third-largest decentralized exchange (dex) globally by volume, Pancakeswap holds $1.66 billion in total value locked (TVL) within the protocol. The dex platform has seen a 16.81% increase over the past month. Despite a monthly surge of 62% in CAKE, the dex platform’s native crypto is still trading 91.80% below its all-time high of $43.96 per coin set on April 30, 2021. As of today, CAKE’s 24-hour intraday trading range has fluctuated between $3.49 and $3.83 per unit.

In anticipation, traditional financial institutions also applied to issue spot Ether ETFs. Since applicants like BlackRock have a near-perfect track record in obtaining SEC approval for their ETFs, spot Ether ETFs are likely to be approved, too. However, the SEC might approve them only after their Bitcoin counterparts, which would mean approval of Ether ETFs in late 2024 or early 2025.
