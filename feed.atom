        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto market is an intricate shade of varying investment strategies and market behaviors, weaving together patterns that create the volatile landscape that has come to be associated with digital currencies. 
 
One thread within this complexity is the activity of short-term Bitcoin holders, who, despite modest profit margins, are keen to sell as Bitcoin stalls around $30,000.
 
The recent price lull has sparked a reevaluation among investors, specifically those who’ve managed to turn a profit in the month’s relatively stagnant market. Short-term holders (STHs), defined as entities holding onto their Bitcoin for 155 days or less, are the ones primarily driving this shift in market behavior.

This move comes after several other major players in the financial industry have also made similar filings, cementing Bitcoin's position as a sought-after asset among traditional investors.
The momentum began with BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset management firms, filing for a spot bitcoin ETF application. Although they were not the first — ARK Investments and 21Shares had already filed for a spot ETF — they initiated the cascading effect now seen. Investment firms Bitwise and Invesco both refiled for their own spot ETFs, which they had submitted previously.

The 1+ years group forms a segment of a larger cohort: the “long-term holders” (LTHs). The LTHs include all investors who bought their coins more than 155 days ago. Therefore, the 1+ years group includes the more experienced…]]></summary>
