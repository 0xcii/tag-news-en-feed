HTX Sees More Outflows Than Inflows
 
Data from DefiLlama shows that HTX has seen over $200 million leave the exchange from a period dating from November 22 up until December 10. This is noteworthy because November 22 happens to be the time when the crypto exchange and blockchain protocol Heco Chain were hacked. This led to a loss of over $100 million in several assets.
 
 
HTX had to halt its operations following the hack. Before it resumed operations back on November 26, the exchange had released a statement in which it 100% guaranteed that users’ funds were safe. However, tha…]]></summary>

Ethereum
 
Today, ethereum’s (ETH) value hovers at $2,239, fluctuating within a 24-hour span between $2,217 and $2,376. This fluctuation underscores the notable instability witnessed in the last half-day. The current market value of ethereum, sitting at $269 billion, alongside a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $18.88 billion, underscores a vigorously active market.

Beginning January 29, 2024, the search giant's revised policy will permit advertisers offering "Cryptocurrency Coin Trusts" targeting the United States, provided they meet specific requirements and gain Google's certification.
This development marks a notable shift from Google's historically cautious stance toward cryptocurrency-related advertisements. The company had previously imposed embargoes on all manner of crypto ads, citing concerns about potential fraud and misleading promotions. However, as the Bitcoin landscape evolves and gains mainstream acceptance, Google appears to be recalibrating its approach.

According to the internet giant, violation of this new policy will not result in the immediate suspension of advertisers’ respective accounts, the multinational technology company said. 
 
Advertisers Must Be Certified by Google
 
Google has announced that starting on Jan. 29, 2024, advertisers of cryptocurrency coin trusts targeting the U.S. market will be required to meet certain requirements. Advertisers of such trusts must apply and get a certificate issued by Google before they start promoting their offerings to the public.
 
According to Google, the so-called cryptocurrency coin trusts are financial products that enable investors to trade shares in trusts holding large pools of digital currency. Google, which has not provided a comprehensive list of the requirements, reminded advertisers they still need to adhere to relevant local regulations.
 
“As a reminder, we expect all advertisers to comply with the local laws for any area that their ads target. This policy will apply globally to all accounts that advertise these products,” Google said.
 
 
However, violation of this new policy will not result in the immediate suspension of advertisers’ respective accounts. Instead, a warning will be issued seven days before the account suspension. To learn more about how to obtain the certificate as well as the restrictions on financial products, Google has asked advertisers to visit its ads policy help page on its website.
 
On this page, Google lists country-specific requirements that advertisers for crypto-related products must satisfy before promoting their products. Google’s issues with crypto advertising date back to 2018, when the company first introduced formal restrictions.
