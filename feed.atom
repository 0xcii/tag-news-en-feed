SEC Chairman Abused His Authority, Emmer Says
 
Through an X post on Friday, Emmer, who is also serving as the US House Majority Whip, once again voiced his displeasure on the SEC’s regulatory actions in the nation’s crypto space.
 
Emmer stated that Gary Gensler, incumbent chairman of the SEC, was misusing his authority at the expense of the American people. The US congressman believes the commission should be restricted from further “weaponizing taxpayer dollars” in its crusade against the digital asset industry.

        <updated>2023-09-09T14:04:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin moved away from a key price floor on Saturday, as the meme coin ended a three-day winless run. Price has traded in the red since Wednesday, leading to a collision with a support point of $0.0620. Stellar also rallied, nearing a one-month high in the process.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) snapped a three-day losing streak on Saturday, as bulls pushed price away from a recent support level.
 
Following a low of $0.06284 on Friday, DOGE/USD moved to a peak of $0.06382 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s gain in price saw the meme coin continue to move beyond its aforementioned floor at the $0.0620 region.
 
 
However, momentum has not fully shifted to the bulls, as a result of the relative strength index (RSI) tracking below a ceiling of 44.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 42.18, which comes as a crossover of moving averages looms.
 
Should the 10-day (red) moving average move beyond its 25-day (blue) counterpart, this could be the sign bulls are waiting for to reenter the market.
 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
Stellar (XLM) extended recent gains to a fourth straight day, as price broke out of a key ceiling in the process.
 
XLM/USD peaked at $0.1328 to start the weekend, following a low of $0.1242 during Friday’s session.
 
Today’s move saw stellar climb to its highest point since August 16, when price peaked at $0.1364.
 
 
As a result of the gain in price, the moving averages of 10-days and 25-days respectively, now also sit on the cusp of an upward cross.
 
This could further push the token higher, with bulls seemingly targeting a higher point of resistance at $0.1400.

The scorching heatwave that gripped the Lone Star State forced the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to take drastic measures to ensure uninterrupted power supply to its 25 million customers, accounting for a staggering 90% of the state’s grid load.
 
To alleviate the energy strain, ERCOT invoked emergency procedures, compelling specific power consumers, including Bitcoin miners, to curtail their energy consumption. The relentless heatwave pushed several mining outfits to temporarily suspend their operations.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-price-movement-in-btc-eth-stalls-to-start-the-weekend/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-09T12:51:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated for yet another week, as price entered Saturday around the same point at which it stood on Monday. Despite a brief rally on Thursday, which saw the price move above $28,000, the cryptocurrency has largely been unchanged. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin started the weekend trading close to the $26,000 level, as bulls attempted to break into this price zone.
 
Friday saw bitcoin peak at $26,414.01, however as the day progressed, price slipped, after bulls were unable to move past a key resistance point.
 
BTC/USD was trading at a low of $25,730.12 earlier in today’s session, however it has marginally risen, and now sits at $25,862.51.
 
 
The slight increase comes as the relative strength index (RSI) moved closer to a key resistance level of 45.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 39.66, after making a move towards a floor of 35.00 on Friday.
 
The 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages look set for a cross in the near future, which could trigger a rise in bullish sentiment.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) has been hovering near a key support point of $1,630 to start the weekend, as market volatility eased on Saturday.
 
Following a low of $1,624.48 on Friday, ETH/USD made marginal gains in today’s session, hitting a peak of $1,637.98 in the process.
 
Despite several attempts by bears to move beyond the aforementioned price floor, bulls have rejected these advances for the majority of the week.
 
 
However, in order for sentiment in the market to shift closer to being bullish, a breakout of the 42.00 level on the RSI would be needed.
 
Price strength is now sitting at 38.67, with ethereum somewhat flatlining around the $1,634 region.

This comes exactly a week after the payment technology platform argued that the court should not certify the commission’s interlocutory appeal.
 
On September 1, Ripple asked the court to deny the SEC’s request to appeal the court’s ruling, as the summary judgment “does not present a controlling question of law suitable for interlocutory appeal.” The financial technology company also stated that the commission’s appeal request lacked the “exceptional circumstances required for interlocutory appeal.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michael Barr, a high-ranking official at the US Federal Reserve, expressed concern over the growing use of “unregulated” stablecoins pegged to the dollar. Many popular stablecoins are designed to mirror the value of the USD.
 
Stablecoin Adoption Risky For US Payment System: Barr
 
In a prepared speech addressing attendees of a fintech conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Barr, who has been vice chair for supervision at the central bank since 2022, thinks if stablecoins become entrenched, they may supplant the USD. 
 
Digital assets could pose “significant risks to financial stability, monetary policy, and the US payments system.” Stablecoins, including USDT and USDC, are core to crypto and have been widely used since the first was issued in 2014.
 
 For instance, USDT, issued by Tether Holdings, has a market cap of over $83 billion and is the third most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ethereum. 
 
 
The second most valuable stablecoin, USDC, though its market cap had slumped over the past few months since March when it briefly depegged following the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), is the second most valuable stablecoin in the top 10. To illustrate its significance and adoption levels in crypto, USDC is worth more than Cardano and Tron.
 
While stablecoins are deployed on public blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon, they are minted by private entities that the Fed or any other global regulator does not directly regulate. Accordingly, the issuance of USDC or USDT is influenced by demand. The higher the demand, the more stablecoins are issued, an arrangement that is “deeply” concerning to Barr. 
 
 
In the speech, the Fed official suggested that stablecoin issuers of tokens that track the value of the world’s reserve currency, USD, should remain under the Fed’s direct supervision and authority. This way, like they guide banks under its preview, “the central bank can control these stablecoin issuers.”]]></summary>
