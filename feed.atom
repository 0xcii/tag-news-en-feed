        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vietnam has taken a significant step towards advancing its blockchain ecosystem by releasing its National Blockchain Strategy.
 
The strategy, announced by the Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) on October 23, outlines a roadmap for the country’s development of a decentralized network and aims to position Vietnam as a “regional leader” in the sector.
 
The strategy aligns with the goals of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a global initiative to integrate major technologies into economies.
 
 
Legal Frameworks And Digital Asset Recognition
 
As disclosed in the report published earlier today, the strategy by Vietnam lays out five core focus areas overseen by government agencies, including the MIC and the Vietnam Blockchain Association.

However, it does not scale in the way most decentralization purists desire. The network, trying to accommodate all its users, now relies mainly on off-chain solutions using roll-up techniques to process more transactions and relieve the mainnet.
 
The Ethereum Layer-2 Boom
 
The result has seen a boom with layer-2 platforms. According to L2Beat, all these off-chain solutions scaling Ethereum manage over $37 billion worth of assets. The largest of them all is Arbitrum, which controls more than $13 billion.
 
 
Despite the boom, the question of decentralization still lingers. Arbitrum, Base, and other layer-2s on Ethereum might be gaining traction, but most have yet to decentralize.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates in September, Bitcoin has been volatile yet predominantly bullish. Analysts and investors are now waiting patiently for the next leg up, as BTC recently stopped at the $69,400 mark and is finding strong support around $66,000. This level is key, as it could determine Bitcoin’s next price movement.
 
 
Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that the Bitcoin Average Profitability Index is currently at 202%, indicating that the price is roughly twice the realized price. This metric provides confidence to investors and traders who expect Bitcoin to continue rising. 
 
With profitability still well below levels that typically trigger mass profit-taking, it suggests more room for BTC to grow before significant selling pressure emerges.
