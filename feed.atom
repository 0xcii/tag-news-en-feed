        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a series of crackdowns on illegal crypto mining operations in the town of Miri on the island of Borneo, Malaysian authorities have seized a total of 171 cryptocurrency mining servers using stolen electricity.
 
The discovery of a covert mining operation was made possible through a tip-off from the public, and it sheds light on the challenges faced by energy suppliers and law enforcement in combating the growing issue of electricity theft for cryptocurrency mining.
 
 
The recent operation in Miri, spearheaded by Sarawak Energy, resulted in the seizure of 34 cryptocurrency mining servers that were found to be tapping into the local grid and utilizing approximately 6,000 Malaysian ringgits ($1300) worth of stolen electricity each month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week trading higher, as markets prepared for a big week of economic data in the United States. The headline announcement will be Friday’s nonfarm payrolls, in addition to services and manufacturing activity data. Ethereum continued to trade above a key support point on Monday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was in the green to start the week, with the price trading at its highest point since last Friday.
 
Traders are optimistic heading into August, which has historically been a bullish month for the cryptocurrency.
 
BTC/USD hit an intraday high of $29,489.87, which comes following a low at $29,059.50 during Sunday’s session.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Bitcoin bulls rejected a breakout below the $29,000 mark, just as the relative strength index (RSI) closed in on a collision with a resistance level at 46.00.
 
This ceiling appears to be a major obstacle preventing price from moving towards its obvious target at the $30,000 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the RSI is tracking at 45.97 with bitcoin at $29,362.66.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) remained above a key support level at $1,850 on Monday, as traders continued to target the $1,900 level.
 
Following a low of $1,851.73 on Sunday, ETH/USD jumped to a peak of $1,884.14 earlier in the day.
 
The world’s second largest cryptocurrency has now gone ten days since it last traded above the $1,900 mark.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Like with BTC, in order for ETH to make further upward strides, it will first need to break out of a current ceiling on the RSI.
 
The index is currently tracking at 47.72, which is marginally below a key resistance level at the 48.00 mark.

One of Bitcoin’s many superpowers is that it takes on different aliases in various cultural environments.

At the same time, any American who is underrepresented and underserved by the legacy financial system is more likely to find that Bitcoin is a means of transferring value without having to have a bank account.
