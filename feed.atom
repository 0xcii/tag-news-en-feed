Loom Network (LOOM) Takes The Spotlight
 
In an X (formerly Twitter) post on Friday, October 13, on-chain data tracker Santiment revealed that a little-known altcoin has been dominating crypto discussions on social media. According to the image shared by Santiment, LOOM is currently leading the list of trending tokens in the last day.
 
 
The discussions have been driven by the altcoin’s incredible performance over the last month. While most of the crypto market has succumbed to the bearish pressures over this time, LOOM put up a significant rally t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided not to appeal a recent court decision favoring Grayscale Investments' Bitcoin ETF conversion plans, according to a report by Reuters. The decision, which comes after a legal battle and months of anticipation, may signal a shift in the regulatory landscape towards the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC.
The decision, according to a confidential source close to the matter, was made internally at the SEC, following a federal court's verdict allowing Grayscale to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. This decision by the SEC not to pursue an appeal marks a significant milestone in the ongoing effort to introduce a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund to the U.S. market.
Grayscale's victory in court was seen as a crucial test case, as it could potentially set a precedent for other spot Bitcoin ETF applicants seeking to convert their products into ETFs. The move towards a Bitcoin ETF has been highly anticipated in the space, as it could provide institutional investors with an easier way to gain exposure to BTC.
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is currently one of the most popular investment vehicles for exposure to Bitcoin, but its structure differs significantly from a traditional ETF. A successful conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF would simplify the investment process and make it more accessible to a broader range of investors.
While the SEC's decision not to appeal is being celebrated by many in the Bitcoin community, it's worth noting that this does not equate to full approval of Grayscale's conversion proposal. The regulatory body will continue to evaluate the proposal within its existing processes, ensuring that it complies with securities laws and investor protection standards.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin did not appear out of nothing. For decades prior to Satoshi Nakamoto introducing his invention, a diverse group of computer scientists, privacy activists, and heterodox economists tried to create a digital form of money that could operate independently of government control. The Genesis Book tells the story of the people and projects that inspired the invention of the world's first successful peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” 
-Cover Sypnosis

Aaron van Wirdum’s long awaited book goes through the pre-history of everything that led up to the creation of Bitcoin. So many individual ideas and concepts went into the creation of Bitcoin that people tend to forget the history of those pieces before Satoshi glued them together into the Bitcoin protocol we know today. 
The Genesis Book gives the readers a long walk through the history of both the people and cultural movements spawned out of the early rise of the hacker community, and how these cultural movements and their respective ethoses shaped the technologies themselves that were produced. The ethos and mentality of the members of early counter-culture groups like the cypherpunks and extropians laid the ideological foundation of the cultures we see thriving in Bitcoin today. 
These same people also laid the technical foundations Bitcoin itself was built upon, through early attempts at digital cash systems like David Chaum’s ecash, to Wei Dai’s b-money. Concepts like Adam Back’s Hashcash and Hal Finney’s Reusable Proof of Work (RPOW) also began the slow road towards Bitcoin’s proof of work consensus system. 
For anyone who wants to truly understand the pre-history of Bitcoin, and the people and technological inventions that laid the groundwork for Satoshi’s gift to us, this book is a must read. 

The book is available for pre-order here, with shipments expected to go out starting on January 3rd, 2024.]]></summary>
