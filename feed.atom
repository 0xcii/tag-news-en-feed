        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data from CoinGeko shows that Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Jupiter recently surpassed Ethereum’s foremost DEX Uniswap in an important metric. This has created a narrative that the SOL network might indeed be ready to take over Ethereum’s position as the King of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). 
 
Jupiter Surpasses Uniswap In Trading Volume 
 
According to CoinGeko, Jupiter has recorded over $510 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours, surpassing Ethereum’s Uniswap V3 and V2, which recorded $455 and $76 million respectively. Jupiter’s recent dominance is believed to be partly due to the recent WEN airdrop that occurred on its launchpad.
 
 
This airdrop caused a splurge of new money into the Solana ecosystem and Jupiter in particular. While that may be the case, it also hi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bankrupt FTX significantly increased its cash holdings to $4.4 billion by the end of 2023 as the collapsed crypto exchange has moved towards repaying customers and creditors. The cash holding almost doubled from $2.3 billion at the end of October, according to Chapter 11 monthly operating reports.
Selling Crypto for Cash
First reported by Bloomberg, the bankruptcy administrators of the crypto exchange sold its crypto assets to raise $1.8 billion last month. The figure only considers the four largest affiliates, including FTX Trading Ltd and Alameda Research LLC, meaning it could go higher if all the affiliates are considered.
The exchange additionally confirmed trading derivatives to hedge exposure on its digital asset holdings and earned extra yield.

Scaramucci also foresees a long-term scenario where BTC could reach $400,000 and potentially near half of gold’s market capitalization, which would represent a 10x increase.
