Pioneers of zero-knowledge systems, the group has revealed plans to leverage OP_CAT in order to bring their STARK technology to Bitcoin. The soft fork proposal could allow zero-knowledge proofs to be verified natively, opening up an entirely new design space for developers.
The announcement is looked at by many as a significant technical milestone for the Bitcoin protocol. Here are my unsolicited 2 cents on the matter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw their second-highest daily inflow ever on Tuesday, taking in over $886 million. This marks the largest single-day haul for the funds since March.

NEW: 🇺🇸 #Bitcoin ETFs saw $886 million in inflows yesterday, the 16th straight day of inflows.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 5, 2024
  
  
  
The ETFs have now seen 16 straight days of inflows, sparking talk of a "second wave" of demand. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund led inflows with $378.7 million, followed by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust at $274.4 million.
In total, the spot Bitcoin ETFs hold over $60 billion worth of BTC. Analysts cite renewed institutional interest and Bitcoin's price resurgence back above $70,000 as drivers of the latest wave of inflows.
It's the highest daily intake for the funds since March 12, when they took in a record $1.04 billion. The next day, Bitcoin went on to hit an all-time high of $73,679, showing the potential impact of the inflows.
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust also saw a rare inflow day of $28.2 million, just the seventh since converting to a spot ETF in January. It joins the renewed enthusiasm despite bleeding funds for most of the year.
With major firms like Fidelity and BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETFs now holding tens of billions in assets, the infrastructure for institutional Bitcoin investment continues maturing.
The latest inflow wave follows Australia, the U.K., and Thailand's recent approval and listing of Bitcoin-regulated funds. With the regulatory climate warming worldwide, Bitcoin ETFs are attracting capital once again.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto industry is stepping up its political game ahead of the upcoming US elections. Leading the charge is Coinbase, the popular US-based crypto exchange, which has donated a whopping $25 million in USDC to the Fairshake Super PAC. This marks Coinbase’s second major contribution to the advocacy group, which aims to promote pro-crypto candidates.
 
 
According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the urgency to support Fairshake’s “stand with crypto” initiative is vital to counter the growing opposition to digital assets among some congressional leaders.
 
In a recent announcement, Armstrong said:
 
 
“The best way to get regulatory clarity in democratic countries is to elect pro-crypto candidates on both sides of the aisle and to vote anti-crypto candidates out of office.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) is poised for a spectacular close to 2024, according to industry heavyweight Mike Novogratz. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, the Galaxy Digital CEO forecasted a price surge to $100,000 by year-end, fueled by a confluence of factors.
 
 
Breaking Through Barriers: The $73,000 Threshold
 
Novogratz’s prediction hinges on a crucial price point – $73,000. He believes surpassing this resistance level in the coming weeks could trigger a domino effect, propelling Bitcoin towards the coveted six-figure mark. His reasoning draws on the concept of “market ranges,” suggesting that once the top crypto establishes a foothold above $70,000, psychological factors could propel it further into the $100,000 territory.
