        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[REvoRevolut, a  
London-based neobank, plans to wrap up its crypto trading offering to users in  
the United States by October 3, CoinDesk reported today (Friday). Users have until September 2 to purchase digital assets on the platform, and another one month to sell their crypto holdings. 
Revolut to  
Quit US Crypto Market
According  
to CoinDesk, the challenger bank blamed the “difficult decision” on the  
“evolving regulatory environment” in the United States. In recent months, the  
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has intensified its crackdown on  
“crypto-asset securities” offered by “unregistered” trading platforms such as Binance and Coinbase. 
In the lawsuit against  
Binance filed in  
early June, the SEC listed 13 tokens, including Cardano’s ADA, Polygon’s MATIC,  
and Solana’s SOL, as unregistered securities. The move forced several platforms including Revolut, Robinhood and eToro, to move towards delisting some of the tokens from their platforms. 
Revolut, which suspended the purchase of ADA, MATIC and SOL on its platform, initially gave its US users until September 18 to sell their holdings. With the deadline several weeks away, Revolut has decided to instead shut down its entire crypto services in the country.
However,  
Revolut in a statement shared with CoinDesk noted that its users from other regions are not affected by  
the decision. It emphasized that the move will impact less than 1% of  
its crypto customers across the world.
“This  
decision has not been taken lightly, and we understand the disappointment this  
may cause,” Revolut stated.

        <updated>2023-08-04T12:40:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is trading near a support point of $29,000, ahead of today’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report. It is expected that 200,000 jobs were added to the economy last month, down from 209,000 in June. Ethereum was marginally lower on Friday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated around the $29,000 level on Friday, as traders readied themselves for the upcoming U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.
 
BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $29,375.71 in today’s session, following an earlier low of $29,066.24.
 
Earlier gains have since faded, however, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency now trading at the $29,145.77 mark.

The decline comes as the relative strength index (RSI) fell back towards a support point of 42.00.
 
After hitting a ceiling above 51.00 in recent days, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 43.71.
 
There is still optimism that bulls could reenter the market after today’s report, with the $29,500 level an initial target.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was once again trading below a key support level during today’s session, as price fell for a third straight day.
 
Following a high of $1,856.41 on Thursday, ETH/USD slipped to a bottom at the $1,828.88 mark earlier in the day.
 
The decline saw ethereum drop below a support point at $1,850, with sellers once again attempting to take price under $1,800.

From the chart, the RSI has also dipped, and fallen below a floor at the 45.00 level for the first time in over a month.
 
Currently the index is at a reading of 42.16, with overall sentiment mostly bearish.
