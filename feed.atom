        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Colorado Securities regulator has accused the pastor of an online-only church of illegally pocketing $1.3 million which was raised via the sale of a cryptocurrency he created. A judge in Colorado has since ordered the closure of the pastor and his wife’s bank accounts for 14 days. 
 
‘The Lord Brought This Cryptocurrency to Me’
 
The securities regulator in Colorado has charged Reverend Eli Regalado, creator of the cryptocurrency INDX coin and pastor of the online-only Victorious Grace Church, with selling “worthless” INDX coins for $3.4 million sometime in 2022 and during the first half of 2023. Tung Chan, Colorado’s securities commissioner, filed a lawsuit on Jan. 16, accusing Regalado of ensuring that investors in his coin did not recoup their investment.

One method of tracking and quantifying this work is by counting the number of “commits” (where a commit is any change recorded in the repository). However, this methodology has an issue: it fails when accounting for forked projects.

This continues the crypto token’s decline, which began around the time the Spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved. Interestingly, a recent development indicates that the defunct crypto exchange FTX has greatly contributed to this price dump. 
 
Why Bitcoin Dropped Below $40,000
 
According to a Bloomberg report, FTX sold off a majority of its shares in Grayecale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) after the Bitcoin ETF conversion. This means that it has partly contributed to Grayscale’s unending BTC sales in a bid to fulfill these redemptions. Grayscale’s move in the market is believed to be the reason why Bitcoin’s price has continued to plummet.

The fund, founded by experienced venture capitalists, will not only invest in outstanding projects but will help nurture them.
 
New Fund Backed by Leading Industry Figures
 
A new blockchain venture capital (VC) fund, Paper Ventures, has been launched with an initial fund of $25 million earmarked for investment in early-stage Web3 and blockchain projects. The fund was mobilized from traditional hedge funds, family offices, exchanges, founders, and high net worth (HNW) crypto OGs.
 
The VC, which claims to have the backing of some prominent industry figures, said it not only seeks to fund but also to nurture outstanding projects. According to a statement, Danish Chaudhry, Oliver Blakey, and Ivailo Jordanov are the founders of Paper Ventures. The three are experienced in investing in Web3 projects.
 
Some of the projects which the trio helped to secure early funding include Frax Finance, SEI, Polygon, Injective, Polkadot, Moonbeam and Cosmos.
 
 
Commenting on the launch of the fund, co-founder Blakey, a former poker pro, said:
 
“We are more than just investors. Our mission at Paper Ventures is to be at the very forefront of innovation, fostering groundbreaking ideas that redefine the boundaries of technology and finance. We believe in the transformative power of blockchain and are committed to supporting those who are as passionate about its potential as we are.”
 
Fellow co-founder Chaudhry expressed his delight and readiness to invest in not only groundbreaking ideas but also to do his part in elevating the brilliant minds behind them. Through Paper Ventures, the co-founders plan to avail their extensive industry experience and network, which can help provide the portfolio projects with the connections they need to succeed.
