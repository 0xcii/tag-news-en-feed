        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Hector Alvero, a Bitcoin educator who serves as co-host of the Broward County Bitcoiners meetup and whose family has worked in the beauty industry for decades.
We all look for ways to educate others about Bitcoin and raise awareness about its benefits. However, time is scarce, so we can't talk to everyone. But what if you could multiply your efforts and help someone close to you benefit from Bitcoin in the process? If you're looking for an orange-pilling opportunity with the most asymmetric upside, consider talking about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network with your barber or stylist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bank of England made an impactful move last Thursday, June 22, 2023, as it raised the benchmark bank rate to 5%, marking a significant 0.5 percentage point increase. This decision catapults the central bank’s rate to its highest level since 2008 and represents the most substantial surge in three months. Coinciding with this development, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) published a study on the same day, asserting that the escalated interest rates would translate into elevated mortgage payments, potentially pushing 1.2 million households in the U.K. towards insolvency in 2023.

His conviction stems from his involvement in a SIM swap attack targeting a high-profile cryptocurrency exchange executive in April 2019, resulting in the theft of digital assets valued at approximately $794,000.
 
Having initially been apprehended in Spain in July 2021, PlugwalkJoe was extradited to the U.S. on April 26, 2023, to face justice. Demonstrating a willingness to cooperate with authorities, he entered a guilty plea in May.

Maximalist Ideology
 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt recently riled altcoiners after he suggested that bitcoin will outperform and outlast what he described as “make-believe cryptos wannabees.” Brandt made the remarks after Mike Cautillo — a private investor at e-Holdings — concurred with his earlier tweet about BTC’s impending “decisive breakout.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the latter half of 2022 and continuing into 2023, the concept of de-dollarization has gained significant traction, making its mark on the mainstream media. This surge in attention can be attributed to the concerted efforts of BRICS countries such as Brazil, China, and Russia, who are endeavoring to diminish the dominance of the greenback, preventing it from reclaiming its former position as the alpha currency. Although a prevailing sentiment suggests that the U.S. dollar’s global reserve status is on the brink of dissolution, there are dissenting voices asserting that the hype surrounding de-dollarization has been exaggerated.

Ferrari Seized From Car Dealer
 
Australian authorities have charged two alleged masterminds of a cryptocurrency scam that defrauded $5.5 million from two unnamed companies, a report has said. One of the men, Fabio Sa Alves, was arrested on June 16 in Sydney, and a day later, 6 luxury and classic vehicles, 11 motorcycles, cryptocurrency wallets, and designer watches were confiscated.
 
According to a local report, law enforcement agencies have seized luxury vehicles valued at $2.7 million, including a Ferrari worth $600,000 taken from a car dealer in Marrickville. Australian law enforcement said Alves used the crypto scam to steal from the two companies in 2021. His accomplice, an unnamed 67-year-old, is accused of authorizing the funds and hiding the Ferrari.
 
 

Residents Told to Deal With Approved Exchanges Only
 
For his actions, Alves has been charged with three counts of “dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception” and for attempting to conceal the stolen funds. A court in Parramatta has since rejected Alves’ bail application and his next appearance is set for Aug. 24. However, Alves’ accomplice was granted bail by a court in Manly.
 
Meanwhile, Gordon Arbinja, the Financial Crimes Squad Commander Detective Superintendent, told residents looking to invest in digital assets to work with approved crypto platforms.
 
“When buying or selling crypto, make sure you use a digital currency exchange that is approved by AUSTRAC and always scrutinise all the details,” Arbinja reportedly said.
