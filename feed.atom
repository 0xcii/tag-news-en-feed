        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many commentators compare Bitcoin with gold, the idea being that its finite supply makes it an attractive long-term store of value. There have been historical examples of broad adoption of gold currencies, such as the British Empire’s sovereign and half-sovereign. However, adoption of the sovereigns was often promoted and directed by the British imperial government, much to the dismay of local administrators who often suffered currency shortages. Bitcoin has no nation state to promote its adoption, so the comparison between it and gold sovereigns is a weak one. One of the world’s most heavily used silver currencies, the Spanish silver dollar, may offer a better comparison.

Why Dogecoin Does Not Need An ETF
 
The popular Dogecoin enthusiast recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to outline an extensive list of why Dogecoin, a meme-based cryptocurrency would succeed without joining the ETF hype. 
 
 
According to the crypto expert, Dogecoin’s inherent status as a meme coin would significantly deter it from being completely acknowledged by renowned financial institutions. As a result, the possibility of the cryptocurrency becoming an ETF is unlikely.

In a surprising move that startled the cryptocurrency market, Circle’s USDC dollar-pegged stablecoin momentarily depegged from its $1 value, falling as low as $0.76 on the Binance exchange platform. This incident occurred during a market-wide sell-off, which was spurred by skepticism over the potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF this month. Notably, USDC experienced three distinct price drops against its tether (USDT) trading pair on Binance between 12:10 and 12:21 UTC, hitting lows of $0.76, $0.803, and $0.8…]]></summary>

SEC Modifies Legal Strategy Against Binance
 
The SEC’s argument hinges on the Terra case’s interpretation of the “investment contract” definition within the context of cryptocurrency offerings. The SEC posits that the court’s application of the Howey Test to classify UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR as investment contracts, and therefore as securities, is directly relevant to the products and services offered by the exchange.
