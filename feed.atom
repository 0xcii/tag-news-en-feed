This grassroots initiative fits with the recent Bitcoin Act proposal by Senator Cynthia Lummis, which seeks to create a distributed network of safe Bitcoin vaults run by the US Treasury.
 
 
Using current Treasury money, the project suggests that the US government purchase one million Bitcoin, or roughly five percent of the whole quantity. Proponents contend that this strategic reserve might be a key instrument for lowering national debt and fighting inflation, thereby establishing the US as a leader in financial creativity.

CrediBULL Crypto mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that PEPE has been holding up quite well despite the downtrend in the broader crypto market. As such, he added that he won’t be surprised if the meme coin witnesses another leg up to take some untapped liquidity before it moves along with the current bearish trend in the market.
