A month after a promising technical breakout above $65.5K, which briefly touched $70K, Bitcoin experienced a sharp reversal, suggesting a possible cycle top. Edwards notes, “Never before has Bitcoin broken a new all-time high and had two retests instead of printing new highs.” This pattern, according to him, indicates a potential size-related consolidation but is generally a sign of market weakness.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a case against Binance. In a post shared by

SEC's Key Claims Rejected
Specifically, the court's decision dismissed the  
contention that crypto tokens, including Binance's native BNB and its  
fiat-backed stablecoin BUSD, could be categorized as securities. Judge Amy  
Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia  
has ruled that these tokens do not meet the criteria for securities, thereby
