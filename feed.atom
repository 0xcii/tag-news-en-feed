        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polkadot (DOT) bulls were in luck this week. After overcoming a hot sell pressure zone, they’ve been able to push the crypto up by 70%, building on the impressive upswing in the last month.
 
Here’s a quick glance at how DOT has been performing lately:
 
 
DOT price up by 0.43%
 
Polkadot bulls eyeing $8

Gemini Co-Founder on Next Crypto Bull Run
 
Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, believes that the next crypto bull run will come from the East. He tweeted Sunday:
 

My working thesis [at the moment] is that the next bull run is going to start in the East. It will be a humbling reminder that crypto is a global asset class.
 
“The West, really the U.S., always only ever had two options: embrace it or be left behind. It can’t be stopped. That we know,” he emphasized.

A recent Merge “upgrade” to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and other changes raised discussion of a possible “flippening” — a situation where Ethereum unseats Bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency in the market. 
 
Instead, Ethereum’s dominance could be in “grave” danger, if an ominous-sounding Japanese candlestick pattern is a prelude of what’s to come across the crypto market. 
 
Lagging Performance Against Crypto Leaves ETH.D Exposed To Danger
 
While Ethereum might be up by 90% from its bear market low compared to Bitcoin’s 50%, when comparing year-to-date returns BTC’s 50% gain against USD beats ETH’s mere 40%. From this metric alone, it’s obvious that Ethereum has been lagging behind Bitcoin.

Galois joins the ranks of BlockFi, Sequoia Capital, Genesis and other firms that have been caught in the FTX crossfire.
 
It takes time for dominos to fall, and despite FTX’s collapse being nearly 4 months in the making, Galois’ collapse is not a surprise for some. Let’s review what’s been revealed in the early stages of the firm’s shutdown.
 
Early Stages: What We Know So Far 
It’s a large fall from grace from what was one of crypto’s largest hedge funds; Galois at one point managed nearly a quarter of a billion dollars worth of assets at it’s peak. In November, immediately following FTX’s fall, it was largely believed that G…]]></summary>
