        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many operators, high market volatility has turned Bitcoin mining into a real rollercoaster. But, some operators enjoy a smooth ride: in just one week, miners reported more than $3.40 million in profits.
 
 
This surge in profit comes at an important time after a period of uncertainty in the cost of operation and the value of Bitcoin, to which miners had to promptly adapt in view of the changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market.
 
Data from the analytic platform CryptoQuant outlined notable surges in miner’s realized profit. One of those surges happened in mid-July when early miners profited more than $1.8 million.

The figure represents about half of the A$382 million ($259 million) losses to all investment scams in the 2023-24 financial year, putting into light a growing threat in the digital space of investing.
 
Contrary to general perceptions, the current targets of these scams are really young people. The AFP claims that 60% of scam victims are under 50 years of age. That dispels the myth on how older people are the most vulnerable ones.
 
According to AFP Assistant Commissioner Richard Chin, scammers have now started using sophisticated tactics like “pig butchering” and deepfak…]]></summary>
