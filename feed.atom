Currently testing the crucial psychological level at $60,000, the cryptocurrency faces a critical phase where investor sentiment is shifting from fear to cautious optimism. 
 
 
This transition comes as many anticipate a potential rally in the coming weeks. Top macro and on-chain analysts, including experts from CryptoQuant, have highlighted that if Bitcoin can break through the significant resistance at $69,500, it may trigger a substantial move toward new highs. 
 
The data suggests that such a breakout could ignite a bullish uptrend, pushing Bitcoin into previously uncharted territory. This critical price point, therefore, could be the key to determining direction in the near te…]]></summary>

The spotlight is on the potential for an interest rate cut, and many traders and investors have been speculating about it for some time now. 
 
Although the exact magnitude of the rate cut has not yet been confirmed, there is widespread anticipation that the FOMC will opt for either a 25-basis point reduction or a more substantial 50-basis point cut. According to a prominent economist, FOMC’s decision could either lead to a sell-the-news event for risky assets like Bitcoin or give them a boost.
