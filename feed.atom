a court filing on Wednesday (yesterday), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)  
firmly opposed the renewed motion for temporary release filed by Sam  
Bankman-Fried, the Founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, ahead of his  
upcoming trial. 
The  
motion sought his temporary release with stringent restrictions.  However, it has been met with strong  
resistance from prosecutors. They contend that the arguments put forth by  
Bankman-Fried's legal team lack specificity and fail to establish a compelling  
case for his release.

Layer one or L1 refers to a base blockchain protocol like Bitcoin or Ethereum. These networks operate on a decentralized ledger secured by proof-of-work (PoW) mining or proof-of-stake (PoS) staking. L1 chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum offer unparalleled security. However, during peak times, both of these chains grapple with sluggish transaction speeds and steep fees.

Public Bitcoin Miners Control Around 28% Of The Total Hashrate
 
In a new post on X, Bloomberg Intelligence market analyst Jamie Coutts discussed how the mining industry has evolved. The first thing Coutts talked about is what the share of the global Bitcoin hashrate is looking like between private and public miners.

This exploration sheds light on the transformative power of tokenization, emphasizing its potential benefits and financial stability implications.
