Paul’s metaphorical ‘crypto spring’ marks the beginning, leading into various phases such as altcoin season, decentralized finance (DeFi) season, explosive growth, and a harsh crypto winter, according to Paul.
 
 
Paul elaborates on the intricacies of these cycles, noting the recurring patterns that seem to define the crypto landscape. “It seems to be always DeFi season.,” he observes, highlighting Ethereum’s (ETH) pivotal role as it begins outperforming Bitcoin during periods of heightened global liquidity…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The year 2023 marked a significant surge in the  
crypto investment landscape, witnessing a staggering $2.2 billion inflow into  
digital asset investment exchange-traded products (ETPs). 
This surge, unveiled by CoinShares' data cited by  
Coindesk, showcased a significant shift, notably driven by the escalating  
anticipation surrounding spot Bitcoin ETFs.
According to James Butterfill from CoinShares, the  
surge in the final quarter was propelled by mounting enthusiasm as the SEC  
hinted at potential approvals for Bitcoin spot-based ETFs in the United States.  

Bitcoin Records Soaring Inflows
The momentum of this surge in investment was  
observed in the final week of 2023. During this period, there was an influx of  
$243 million into digital asset ETPs, underlining the heightened investor  
interest in cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin emerged as the frontrunner in these  
investments, capturing the largest share of $1.9 billion in inflows,  
representing a remarkable 87% of the total $2.2 billion. This dominance,  
unprecedented in the crypto investment landscape, marked a significant shift,  
surpassing the previous high of 80% in 2020.

The price rally of Bitcoin through the year  
contributed substantially to this surge, witnessing a notable 155% climb and  
concluding 2023 at an impressive $42,000.
While Bitcoin led the charge, Solana (SOL) also  
showcased a robust performance in 2023, garnering $167 million in net inflows.  
Ethereum (ETH), however, lagged with a comparatively modest $78 million  
in the same period.

There have been historical examples of broad adoption of gold currencies, such as the British Empire’s sovereign and half-sovereign. However, adoption of the sovereigns was often promoted and directed by the British imperial government, much to the dismay of local administrators who often suffered currency shortages. Bitcoin has no nation state to promote its adoption, so the comparison between it and gold sovereigns is a weak one. One of the world’s most heavily used silver currencies, the Spanish silver dollar, may offer a better comparison.

The popular Dogecoin enthusiast recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to outline an extensive list of why Dogecoin, a meme-based cryptocurrency would succeed without joining the ETF hype. 
 
 
According to the crypto expert, Dogecoin’s inherent status as a meme coin would significantly deter it from being completely acknowledged by renowned financial institutions. As a result, the possibility of the cryptocurrency becoming an ETF is unlikely.
