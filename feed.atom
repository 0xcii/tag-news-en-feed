        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was one of Friday’s notable crypto gainers, rallying to a one-month high earlier in today’s session. Bullish sentiment returned to end the week, with the global market cap trading nearly 1.5% higher as of writing. Solana also surged, moving back above the $20.00 mark.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was one of today’s biggest movers, climbing by as much as 5% earlier in the day.
 
Following a low of $0.5036 yesterday, XRP/USD raced to a peak of $0.5455 during Friday’s session.
 
This resulted in the token hitting its highest point since August 29, which is the last time price hit a ceiling of $0.5490.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that the move came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose beyond a ceiling of its own at 56.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 58.67, with the next visible point of support near the 60.00 mark.
 
In the event the 60.00 ceiling is broken, there is a good chance that XRP will climb beyond $0.5500.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
In addition to XRP, solana (SOL) also rallied strongly on Friday, rising above $20.00 in the process.
 
SOL/USD climbed to a high of $20.32 earlier in today’s session, following Thursday’s low at $19.22.
 
This surge has seen solana hit a nine-day high, which comes after three straight days of bullish momentum.
 
 
Overall, the uptrend comes as the 10-day (red) moving average rose above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Bulls are likely now targeting a higher resistance level of $21.00, which would result in a four-week high.

        <updated>2023-09-29T15:46:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry, Su Zhu, co-founder of the failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), was arrested at Changi Airport in Singapore while attempting to leave the country. 
 
Zhu’s arrest led to a subsequent court order sentencing him to four months in prison, as confirmed by 3AC’s joint liquidator, Teneo.
 
 
Three Arrows Capital Co-Founder Apprehended 
 
According to reports, While Zhu now serves his prison term, the liquidators will actively engage with him to address matters concerning Three Arrows Capital. 
 
Their primary focus will be on recovering assets belonging to 3AC or acquired using the fund’s resources. The liquidators seek to maximize returns for the hedge fund’s creditors and will initiate further court proceedings as necessary.
 
The arrest and subsequent sentencing of Zhu follow the earlier granting of a committal order on September 25. This order was obtained due to Zhu’s intentional non-compliance with a court directive that required his cooperation with the liquidators’ investigations. 
 
Specifically, Zhu was obligated to provide a detailed account of his activities as a co-founder of 3AC and its former investment manager.
 
A similar committal order was also issued against Kyle Davies, the other co-founder of Three Arrows Capital. However, Davies’ current whereabouts remain unknown, according to Teneo.
 
 
The liquidators have consistently prioritized the recovery of 3AC’s assets and maximized returns for its creditors throughout the process. Their efforts focus on retrieving 3AC’s property and assets acquired using the fund’s funds. 
 
Lastly, Teneo emphasized that they will continue to work diligently towards these objectives, potentially seeking additional court orders to facilitate the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to trade above the $27,000 level on Friday, after a surge beyond this point towards the end of yesterday’s session. Ethereum rallied to a one-week high.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin remained above the $27,000 level on Friday, following a late rise in bullish sentiment towards the end of Thursday’s session.
 
Following a low of $26,424.95 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $27,259.50 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, bitcoin rose to its highest level since September 20, when price peaked at $27,393.00.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
However, earlier gains have since edged lower, largely due to a collision which took place on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Looking at the chart, the index was unable to push past a resistance level of 58.00, and has since fallen to a reading of 56.57.
 
Traders could be awaiting the release of this afternoon’s consumer sentiment report in the United States, prior to deciding their next move.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) continued to trend higher on Friday, breaking out of a key resistance level in the process.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,687.28 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after trading at a low of $1,620.68.
 
This surge has resulted in ethereum climbing over a long held ceiling at $1,670, hitting a one-month high in the process.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
The latest uptrend coincided with the relative strength index moving beyond a ceiling of its own at 57.00. It is now tracking at 58.61.
 
Bulls will likely remain unsatisfied until they take ethereum back above $1,700, which hasn’t happened since the end of August.
