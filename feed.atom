According to a notice published on Friday, SEBC will terminate its operations at the end of May and will start to offer crypto exchange services under the tentative branding of Binance Japan in June.   

As such, the local Japanese exchange requested its customers to liquidate their cryptocurrency holdings and withdraw fiat to their bank accounts. Otherwise, the platform will automatically liquidate all crypto holdings on June 5 and return the money to customers’ linked bank accounts.

A single individual has been identified as the brains behind the release of 114 questionable meme coins in just two months, according to reports.
 
ZachXBT, along with other internet sleuths, discovered that only one person was responsible for 114 meme coin frauds.
 
The wallet address in question is 0x739c58807B99Cb274f6FD96B10194202b3EEfB47, and the same deposit address is used each time funds are taken.

The figure declined due to a decline in Bitcoin price and an increase in the global hash rate.  

Argo Blockchain's 2022 Results  

The company mined 2,156 Bitcoins in 2022, which is a decrease of 5 percent, while its hash rate capacity increased 55 percent. At the end of the year, it held 141 Bitcoins, out of which 116 were Bitcoin Equivalents.  

Argo, listed in London and New York, closed in 2022 with an adjusted EBITDA of £1 million ($1.2 million), which is down from £55 million ($74.2 million) in 2021. Its mining margin came down to 54 percent from the previous year's 84 percent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cybercriminals have reportedly breached AT&T email accounts and are using the access gained to steal crypto assets from their victims. While a spokesperson for AT&T has denied claims that hackers have gained access to the company’s internal systems, a report suggests that as much as $20 million worth of crypto may have been stolen.
 
Criminals ‘Used an API Access’
 
Cybercriminals have reportedly gained access to AT&T email accounts and are using this to hack into targeted victims’ crypto exchange accounts. According to a Techcrunch report, the criminals using this modus operandi may have stolen crypto assets worth between $15 million and $20 million.
 
Although two victims are said to have confirmed the theft, a spokesperson for AT&T has in the meantime rejected suggestions that criminals have gained access to the company’s internal systems.
 
“There was no intrusion into any system for this exploit. The bad actors used an API access,” said Jim Kimberly, the spokesperson for AT&T.
 

 
As explained in the Techcrunch report, unknown parties are thought to have found a way of hacking into personal AT&T email accounts that use att.net, sbcglobal.net, and bellsouth.net addresses. To achieve this, the hackers reportedly use access to the telecommunication company’s internal network which then enables them to create mail keys for any user.
 
Having gained a targeted person’s keys, the criminals are then able to login and reset the victim’s passwords including those on crypto exchange apps. To prove that cybercriminals have indeed gained access to AT&T’s internal systems, a whistleblower is said to have shared a list of the hackers’ alleged victims.
 
While AT&T has acknowledged the “unauthorized creation of secure mail keys,” the spokesperson insisted that the company had responded to this by updating its security controls. The company said it has locked some email accounts to force the owners to reset passwords.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking News: As Reuters just reported, US officials are currently coordinating urgent talks to rescue the troubled First Republic Bank (FRC) – for Bitcoin, this could mean rally-time once again if history repeats itself as it has in recent weeks. Already on Tuesday, BTC experienced a sudden rally after First Republic Bank released its quarterly report with devastating numbers.
 
Thus, the narrative that first surfaced on March 10 repeated itself. After the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate, news of a bank failure served as a trigger for several upward moves in Bitcoin. And First Republic Bank could be another argument boosting confidence in Bitcoin and eroding trust in the banking system.

The crypto giant had looked into the relocation option due to regulatory scrutiny and lack of clarity from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
In previous efforts to get the needed clarity to operate freely and offer crypto services to their US customers, the US-based crypto trading platform asked the SEC for reasonable crypto rules and regulations for Americans. This move made by Coinbase was met with legal threats from the regulator and a Wells notice.

In a historic verdict, US District Judge Lee Yeakel has ordered a South African executive to pay more than $3.4 billion in restitution and fines for a fraud scheme involving Bitcoin. 
 
Cornelius Johannes Steynberg, the founder and CEO of Mirror Trading International Proprietary, was involved in a global “fraudulent multilevel marketing scheme” to solicit Bitcoin from people for participation in an unregistered commodity pool operated by Mirror Trading.
 
The scheme resulted in the solicitation of at least 29,421 Bitcoin, worth more than $1.7 billion in March 2021, from at least 23,000 individuals in the United States and from around the world.

The Bitcoins were linked to Helix, an online Bitcoin mixture run by Larry Harmon, Gary Harmon’s brother. Gary effectively transferred those Bitcoins, then valued at $4.8 million, using his brother’s credentials to a wallet he controlled to prevent law enforcement from forfeiting them. He then used two Bitcoin mixing services to hide the trail to these Bitcoins before using them to ‘finance large purchases and other expenditures’.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
