This surge in value has been accompanied by a surge in another key metric: transaction fees.
 
 
Ethereum Network Feeling The Heat Of Increased Demand

Since early March, Ether has seen a dramatic increase in transaction volume, with a single day recording a staggering $50 billion – the highest level since 2022. This surge in activity has pushed transaction fees to a …]]></summary>

The convertible bond, initially sold during the pandemic as demand for tech and growth stocks soared, has now reached a two-year high, benefiting from the recovery in digital asset prices. 
 
According to Bloomberg, this resurgence in the bond’s value mirrors a broader resurgence in the appetite for convertible bonds, particularly in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, where some firms have successfully issued bonds with no coupon.
