        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent revelation by a SlowMist security researcher has highlighted a new type of attack aimed at cryptocurrency holders using Apple devices. The researcher disclosed that a malicious phishing program has been detected on the Apple App Store which he described as the newest form of attack targeting Apple IDs.
 
Cryptocurrency users have been warned to be particularly cautious as many of them rely on iCloud to back up their wallets. This is because, in the event of an attack, their assets could be at risk of loss if their 2FA gets compromised.
 
The malicious phishing program is able to do this by replicating normal applications. And subsequently, the attacker adds their own number to the trusted two-factor authentication list, thereby gaining control over the account permissions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded from a one-month low Tuesday, as markets prepare for the upcoming U.S. consumer confidence report. The confidence index is expected to increase to a reading of 111.5 in July, up from 109.7 the month prior. Ethereum also bounced higher, after colliding with a key price floor.
 
Bitcoin
 

 
After dropping to a one-month low to start the week, bitcoin (BTC) rebounded in today’s session.
 

 
BTC/USD jumped to a peak at $29,327.86 earlier in the day, following Monday’s drop to a bottom of $28,934.29.
 

 
Bitcoin bulls rejected the pressure to settle at a support point of $28,800, and now seem to be targeting a ceiling of $30,000.
 

 

 

 
One reason why the price appears to have stabilized is the relative strength index (RSI), which found a floor of its own around 42.00.
 

 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 41.90, with the next point of support around the 37.00 mark.
 

 
Currently, it appears that price will remain marginally stable above $29,000, however this could change following this afternoon’s report.
 

 

 
Ethereum
 

 
Ethereum (ETH) bounced from a support point of its own on Tuesday, after slipping to a multi-week low on Monday.
 

 
Following a bottom at $1,836.85 to start the week, ETH/USD marginally rose to an intraday high of $1,862.43 in today’s session.
 

 
The bounce came after ethereum moved away from a recent support point at the $1,830 mark, with $1,900 now the likely target.
 

 

 

 
Similar to bitcoin, ETH’s RSI settled at a floor around 43.00, which has played a big part in halting yesterday’s sell-off.
 

 
Now tracking at 45.00, the next visible point of resistance lies at 50.00, and a move to this point will almost certainly send ETH to $1,900.

In an exciting revelation, the platform announced on Twitter its acceptance of a submission from these two remarkable “on-chain sleuths,” awarding them a bounty payment of 9,519.2625 Arkham (ARKM), valued at approximately $5,000.
 
Since its launch on July 10, Arkham Intel Exchange has not been without its critics within the crypto community.

University education is expensive. Even within the U.K., tales of students leaving with £90,000 (about $115,000) of debt are not uncommon, which raises the question of the value that can be realized by a university degree when offset by this considerable cost. 
To help manage the scale of this expenditure, it is now common for students to have part-, if not full-time, jobs, with recent figures showing this is the case for the majority of students in the U.K. The same article also stated that the time some students spend on university work suffers as a result of the time they dedicate to paid employment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the hype of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) may have centered around skyrocketing sales and celebrity purchases, a less-publicized metric has been quietly mounting: royalties. Fresh insights into this critical element of the NFT ecosystem reveal that royalties paid to NFT projects on Ethereum have reached roughly 699,816 ETH.
 
An in-depth analysis by on-chain data analytics firm Nansen has found that these royalties, at current prices are worth $1.3 billion, and at the time of the NFT sale the royalties amount to approximately $1.8 billion.
 
 
At current prices, that translates to approximately $1.3 billion USD. But it’s important to note that when we price ETH at the time of NFT sale, lifetime royalties are much higher at $1.8 billion USD
