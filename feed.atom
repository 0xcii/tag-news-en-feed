        <updated>2024-02-13T10:01:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wall Street is on a Bitcoin buying spree, acquiring the digital asset at a staggering rate 12.5 times greater than its daily production, according to industry expert Anthony Pompliano. This relentless accumulation hints at big money’s growing conviction in the cypto’s future, fueled by the approaching “halving” event and the recent green light for ETFs.
 
 
Imagine printing money, then cutting production in half. That’s essentially what happens with Bitcoin’s halving, scheduled for April 2024. Every four years, the reward for mining new Bitcoins gets slashed, gradually reducing the total supply to a predetermined 21 million. This built-in scarcity is a major draw for institutions, who anticipate a price surge as demand outpaces supply.

CZ’s Sentencing Postponed
Zhao pleaded guilty to one count of money laundering last November and agreed to step down from the role of CEO at Binance as a part of the plea deal. He further paid $50 million personally in penalty for compliance lapses.
Meanwhile, Binance settled with the US Department of Justice, paying over $4.3 billion, and agreed to terminate all operations in the countr…]]></summary>
