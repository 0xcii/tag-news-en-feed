It provides for a Joint Advisory Committee consisting of participants from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It would, therefore, look to harmonize the sometimes-conflicting regulations existing presently between the two agencies for digital assets, coming under both securities and commodities jurisdictions.
 
Rose argues that the “regulation-by-enforcement” approach stifles innovation and drives investment overseas, requiring the United States to create an environment friendlier to digital asset development.
