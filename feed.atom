U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has requested a summary judgment  
from a federal judge in its case against Do Kwon and Terraform Labs, in a move

SEC's  
Case against Terraform Labs and Kwon
The  
SEC's filing states that there is no dispute regarding the fact that purchasers

The crypto market witnessed a remarkable surge in SHIB’s value as Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new milestone at $35,000, though it subsequently pulled back to the $34,000 level. 
 
This substantial upward momentum spurred investors to act swiftly and secure positions in anticipation of what promises to be an exciting bull run. However, as we enter November, the crucial question looming over the market is whether these gains can be sustained.
 
 
Shiba Inu Recent Performance
 
Shiba Inu came tantalizingly close to initiating a fresh recovery phase, aiming to break through resistance at the $0.000008 mark. Still, profit booking and, potentially, a lack of buyers led to a minor pullback. As of the latest…]]></summary>
