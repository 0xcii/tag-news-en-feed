A Healthy New Year For Everyone
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Kusama wished everyone in the community a “healthy new year.” He also used the opportunity to send out his condolences to those in Japan who have been victims of the earthquake that recently struck the country. The developer sounded zen as he wished for a new year “filled with hope and peace.”
