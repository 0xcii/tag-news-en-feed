        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto.com and UEFA announced today (Wednesday) a new multi-year  
partnership, making Crypto.com the first and exclusive global cryptocurrency  
platform partner of the UEFA Champions League. Under this agreement, Crypto.com  
will serve as an official global sponsor for the league.
Unveiling UEFA Partnership
The partnership includes efforts to enhance fan engagement  
by creating specific experiences at matches. Both organizations plan to focus  
on integrating football and cryptocurrency through in-stadium activations,  
broadcast features, and advertising campaigns. 
The first instance of this  
collaboration will be seen at the UEFA Super Cup on August 14, 2024, where  
Crypto.com’s branding will be displayed.
This sponsorship is part of Crypto.com's efforts to expand  
its presence in sports and entertainment. The company has previously entered  
into partnerships, including deals with Formula 1, UFC, and FIFA, as well as  
securing naming rights for the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.

These blockchains, mainly Solana, allow users to deploy smart contracts cheaply, all while remaining trustless and, to some extent, reliable.
 
Bot Activity Is Not After All Bad–Here’s Why
 
However, while Solana and some Ethereum layer-2 platforms have drawn users, they are also a hive of bot activity. The near-zero fees in Solana explain the spike in bot activity, both useful and malicious, drawing the attention of analysts.

BREAKING: 🇺🇸 Goldman Sachs reports holding over $400 million in spot #Bitcoin ETFs in new SEC filing 👀 pic.twitter.com/n4nWDfCm6w
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 14, 2024
  
  
  
In a quarterly filing, the Wall Street titan revealed investments in 7 different Bitcoin ETFs available in the U.S. market. Its largest position was in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), worth nearly $240 million.
Goldman also held shares of the $79.5 million Fidelity Bitcoin ETF, $35.1 million in Grayscale BTC, $56.1 million in Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin, $8.3 million in Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, and smaller stakes in funds from WisdomTree, Ark Invest.
The disclosure highlights surging institutional demand for Bitcoin products as Bitcoin gains mainstream adoption. With its sizable and diverse Bitcoin ETF holdings, Goldman aims to benefit from Bitcoin's upside potential without direct ownership.
Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs' head of digital assets called Bitcoin ETFs an "astonishing success," signalling a pivot after years of the Wall Street giant's scepticism about Bitcoin.
As legacy finance gradually embraces Bitcoin, Bitcoin ETFs have become a prime gateway for institutional participation. ETFs offer familiarity and liquidity while muting Bitcoin's volatility swings.
Eventually, most major financial institutions will likely hold significant Bitcoin exposure to meet client demand. Goldman's Bitcoin ETF bet signals an understanding that Bitcoin is here to stay.]]></summary>

According to the report, the Australian man named Jatinder Singh, aged 39, and his “then-partner” Thevamanogari Manivel, 41, were sent roughly $10.47 million by Crypto.com due to a clerical error involving an Excel spreadsheet mistake by a Bulgarian-based employee.
 
As reported by local news media, this mishap happened when the employee mistakenly typed Singh’s bank account number as the amount to be refunded, leading to an enormous deposit into their account.
