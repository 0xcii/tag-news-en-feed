        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, investor sentiment has improved, pushing Bitcoin’s (BTC) price to a year high amid a spree of spot ETF applications by top US-based asset managers. Since the ETF buzz, the crypto asset has been fighting to sustain new-found support while claiming higher positions.
 
Amid this development, several analysts predicted a massive price surge for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. A top analyst, managing partner, and founder of Fairlead Strategies, Katie Stockton, dropped a bold price prediction for BTC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano was one of the notable gainers on July 4th, as the token jumped to a ten-day high in today’s session. The move came as the global cryptocurrency market was mostly in the green, despite the lower than usual market volume. Polygon also hit a multi-week high.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) climbed to a ten-day high on Tuesday, despite the market volume being low as a result of Independence Day in the United States.
 
ADA/USD rose to a peak of $0.3009 earlier in the session, which comes a day after dropping to a bottom at $0.2917.
 
Following today’s rally, cardano jumped to its highest level since June 25, when the token was above $0.305.
 
 
As seen on the chart, Tuesday’s move pushed ADA marginally above a ceiling of $0.295, however bears have rejected a full breakout.
 
The token is now hovering close to this point, with the relative strength index (RSI) below a ceiling of its own at 51.00.
 
Price strength is currently at a reading of 49.91, after earlier momentum faded.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) remained near a four-week high in today’s session, following a five-day bulls run.
 
MATIC/USD bulls pushed the price to a peak of $0.7193 late on Monday, with traders consolidating these gains today.
 
The token dropped to an intraday low of $0.6829 earlier in the session, after reaching its strongest point since mid-June the day prior.
 
 
One of the catalysts of the drop appears to be a collision with a ceiling at 55.00, which is on the RSI indicator.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now at a reading of 51.60, which is marginally above floor at 51.00.
 
Should this floor fail to hold in the coming days, it is likely that more bears will reenter the market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved back above the $31,000 level on July 4th, as U.S. traders celebrated the Independence Day holiday. As a result of the rally, the cryptocurrency remained near a one-year high in today’s session. Ethereum consolidated after Monday’s gains.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved closer to a fresh one-year high on Tuesday, as U.S. markets closed in celebration of the July 4th holiday.
 
Following a low of $30,586.51 to start the week, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $31,375.61 earlier in the session.
 
The move saw bitcoin edge closer to last Friday’s high at $31,443, which was its strongest point since June last year.
 
 
Earlier momentum has since faded, as the relative strength index (RSI) collided with a resistance level at 70.00.
 
The index is now tracking at 68.43 and appears to be heading for a support point at the 66.00 mark.
 
Should it reach this point, there is a strong possibility that bitcoin will be trading around the $30,500 level.
 
 
Ethereum
 
After moving towards $2,000 on Monday, ethereum (ETH) slipped in today’s session, falling below $1,950.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,949.15 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after peaking at $1,974.78.
 
The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has since rebounded and is once again closing in on a multi-month high.
 
 
In order to get there, ETH bulls will need to take price strength above an upcoming ceiling at the 64.00 zone.
 
Currently, the RSI has a reading of 62.59, which is its highest level since April 19, when the price was above $2,100.
 
Some believe that ETH could head back toward this point in the coming weeks.

For years, you could basically only do two things on the Bitcoin network: You could save BTC or you could spend it. Then, a late 2021 privacy upgrade had the unintended consequence of allowing data storage on the Bitcoin blockchain, resulting in NFT-like inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens, both applying Ordinal Theory for asset tracking. 
The popularity of NFT-like Ordinal inscriptions and the experimental BRC-20 token standard has driven up transaction costs across the Bitcoin network. The frothy demand for “stamping” limited block space with new data pushed transaction costs so high that in May 2023, Binance twice had to pause BTC withdrawals, a risky and undesira…]]></summary>
