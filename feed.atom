This is noteworthy because November 22 happens to be the time when the crypto exchange and blockchain protocol Heco Chain were hacked. This led to a loss of over $100 million in several assets.

This development marks a notable shift from Google's historically cautious stance toward cryptocurrency-related advertisements. The company had previously imposed embargoes on all manner of crypto ads, citing concerns about potential fraud and misleading promotions. However, as the Bitcoin landscape evolves and gains mainstream acceptance, Google appears to be recalibrating its approach.
