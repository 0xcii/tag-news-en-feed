Miners Fueled BTC ATH Rally
 
On Tuesday, March 5, 2024, BTC hit a new all-time high, soaring to $69,200, and surpassing its previous peak in November 2021 when the price of the cryptocurrency traded at around $69,000.

On February 22, the bill passed the Senate's Third Reading in a 16-13 vote, and is now being reviewed by the House for the second time. 
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
The proposal emphasizes the importance of monitoring developments in Bitcoin ETFs, while also urging ASRS and PSPRS to consider the implications of including such assets in their portfolios. This includes consulting with firms approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer Bitcoin ETFs.
Additionally, ASRS and PSPRS would be required to submit a comprehensive report on the feasibility, risks, and potential benefits of directing a portion of state retirement system funds into Bitcoin ETFs. The report, which would include options and recommendations for safely investing in the asset class, would be submitted to key state officials at least three months before the beginning of the Fifty-Seventh Legislature, First Regular Session.
The proposal aims to provide ASRS and PSPRS with the information needed to make informed decisions about integrating Bitcoin ETFs into their investment strategies, potentially diversifying their portfolios and exploring new avenues for growth.]]></summary>

What Bitcoin On-Chain Data Says
 
One of the core metrics, Bitcoin’s Energy Value, now places BTC’s value at $70,000. Edwards explains, “Bitcoin’s intrinsic value priced from the pure Joules of energy into the network only. Currently at $70K, making Bitcoin fairly valued for the first time in 2 yrs.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a surprising twist, Binance, the crypto exchange behemoth, has hit the brakes on Solana (SOL) withdrawals due to a colossal surge in network activity. The Solana blockchain, known for its lightning-fast transactions, finds itself entangled in a web of congestion, prompting Binance to announce a temporary suspension of withdrawals, effective since March 4, 2024.
 
The temporary pause in withdrawals comes as the decentralized finance (DeFi) buzzes with activity. DeFiLlama data reveals a remarkable surge in Solana’s total value locked, skyrocketing to $2.6 billion from $1.65 billion just a month ago.
 
 
Binance’s decision, born out of necessity, comes as transaction volumes on the Solana network reached unprecedented heights, causing operational hiccups that demand immediate attention. Bi…]]></summary>

It Is Officially Altcoin Season When This Happens, Cardano Founder
 
Hoskinson mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that it is officially altcoin season when Dogecoin (DOGE) flips Cardano (ADA). The Cardano founder’s post is significant, considering that ADA and DOGE are going head-to-head, with both tokens presently ranking as the 8th and 9th largest tokens by market cap. 
 
 
The altcoin season (going by Hoskinson’s belief) may have already kickstarted since DOGE momentarily surpassed ADA in market cap on March 5. However, the meme coin quickly dropped below ADA once again…]]></summary>

The surge is attributed to increased demand for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), providing a less risky entry into the crypto market. Investors are drawn to bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset, making it appealing for portfolio diversification.
 
Spot bitcoin ETFs offer direct exposure to bitcoin without physical ownership, distinct from traditional ETFs using futures contracts as underlying assets.
