        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zion’s latest funding round brings the decentralized social platform company’s valuation to $53 million.
Miami-based startup Zion has launched a new version of its app providing access to the Web5 decentralized social network, alongside the raising of $6 million in a funding round led by XBTO Humla Ventures.
The Zion protocol is designed to allow creators to own their communities while users have control over their online identity, and is based on Jack Dorsey’s Block’s Web5 standards and the Bitcoin Lightning Network. According to the release, Zion's v2 app has a waiting list of over 60,000 users and a valuation of $53 million. The latest round of funding was backed by a range of investors, including footballer Aaron Rodgers and motivational speaker Tony Robbins.
The new app provides a "universal standard for social data exchange" based on "decentralized identities, communities and social content" and "interoperable peer-to-peer relationships.” Its features include a decentralized identifier system, decentralized web nodes and a Bitcoin Lightning wallet. Zion claims to have already served over 3,000 creators, while processing more than 120,000 transactions between creators and fans using Lightning.
Founder and CEO Justin Rezvani said that the company's business model was "based on giving you a product that you can use to build your audience, that you can own and monetize". The aim, he added, is for Zion to be "the last platform you ever have to build an audience on". The protocol, Rezvani said, was a response to the "large-scale censorship of speech and a ceaseless array of data breaches, globally" that has resulted from centralized social media platforms.
Greg Carson, managing partner at XBTO Humla Ventures, said the team at Zion combined "a deep understanding of creator communities and scalable peer-based content technology" with a Lightning payments network, making the company "a unique and exciting investment for the ecosystem".]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-shib-surge-as-elon-musk-tweets-dog-ceo-pictures/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-15T17:03:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin rallied on Feb. 15, as Elon Musk tweeted a picture of a Shiba Inu dog, with the caption: “The new CEO of Twitter is amazing.” Following this tweet, both dogecoin and shiba inu surged, extending recent gains. Overall, the global cryptocurrency market cap is 2.42% higher as of writing. 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) rose by as much as 6% on Wednesday, as markets reacted to tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
 
DOGE/USD surged to an intraday high of $0.08707 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after trading at a bottom of $0.08141.
 
Today’s move saw the meme coin climb for a second straight session, breaking out of a resistance level at $0.0840 in the process.
 
 
Upside momentum comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) surged, and as of writing it is tracking at 50.81
 
Price strength has now risen to its highest point in nearly a week, and is fast approaching a ceiling at 52.00.
 
As a result of this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, with dogecoin now trading at $0.08656.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) also rose for a second consecutive day, breaking out of a resistance level of its own.
 
Following a low of $0.00001222 on Tuesday, SHIB/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.00001313 earlier in the day.
 
Like with dogecoin, today’s rally saw the meme coin race past a ceiling at $0.00001285, climbing by nearly 6% in the process.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, there was also a breakout on the RSI indicator, which moved beyond a ceiling at 55.00
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 56.95, with the nearest point of resistance at the 61.00 mark.
 
There is a chance that early bulls will opt to take profit close to this point, as overall market sentiment remains partially bearish.

What BUSD’s Crackdown Means For Wider Crypto Market
 
A couple of days back, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells Notice to Paxos for issuing an unregistered security, the stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD). Following the notice, Paxos has made an announcement that the company will stop the issuance of new tokens of the stablecoin from February 21, 2023.
 
Since BUSD is one of the biggest players in the market (currently sitting at 7th in the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap list), investors have been wondering what impact this debacle might have on the sector. In its latest weekly report, Arcane Research has tackled t…]]></summary>
