        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The price of Cardano (ADA) could be gearing up for a substantial price rally to new highs as a crypto analyst has identified an “insane bullish divergence” in the ADA/BTC price chart. This unique technical pattern has sparked expectations of a potential 10X rally in ADA’s price. 
 
Why Cardano Price Could Surge 10X
 
Dan Gambardello, a popular crypto analyst has relayed his optimistic projections of the price of ADA, the native token of the Cardano ecosystem. While analyzing the ADA/BTC price chart, Gambardello uncovered a bullish divergence pattern which suggests that a price rebound may be imminent for ADA.
 
 
 
Typically, a bullish divergence occurs when the price of a cryptocurrency, in this case Cardano, makes a new low but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator does not. This c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum has witnessed a drop towards the $2,350 level as on-chain data reveals the whales have been making large exchange inflows recently.
 
Ethereum Exchange Netflows Have Been Positive Recently
 
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the ETH Exchange Netflow has been positive recently. The “Exchange Netflow” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the net amount of Ethereum that’s flowing into or out of the wallets connected to centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric is positive, it means the investors are depositing a net number of tokens into these platforms. As one of the main reasons holders may transfer their coins to the exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this trend can be bearish for the asset’s price.
