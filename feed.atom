Knesset member Dan Ilouz is the sponsor of the bill, which has garnered strong support from the ruling coalition parties, according to Ilouz himself.
 
Highlights Of The Crypto Bill
 
The bill aims to bring equity to the treatment of crypto bonuses for employees by reducing the existing tax rate of 50% on such bonuses to 25%, aligning it with the tax rate applied to stock options.
 
Before this bill, employees in the crypto industry were subject to double the tax rate on their options compared to their counterparts in the traditional high-tech sector. Additionally, foreign investors in th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose to a fresh one-year high on Thursday, as markets reacted to the release of June’s FOMC minutes. The report on last month’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed that “almost all participants” are in favor of further hikes this year. Ethereum also rebounded following the minutes.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) climbed higher on Thursday, as traders continued to react to the latest FOMC minutes report.
 
The minutes revealed that “Almost all participants noted that in their economic projections that they judged that additional increases in the target federal funds rate during 2023 would be appropriate.”
 
BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak at $31,460.05, which comes following a low at $30,225.61 earlier in today’s session.
 
 
As a result of this high, BTC rose to its strongest point since last June, when the price was trading above $32,000.
 
Bulls appear to be once again targeting this point, however will first need to break out of a ceiling at $31,500.
 
So far they have been unable to do this, pushing the price to a current level at $30,750.56.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) briefly rose in today’s session, however has since slipped, as market momentum began to shift.
 
Following an earlier high at $1,956.01, ETH/USD has dropped to a bottom at $1,909.66 at the time of writing.
 
The downturn came as traders once again failed to breach a key resistance level at the $1,960 mark.
 
 
This came as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to break a ceiling at the 61.00 level, earlier in the week.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 55.43, and seems to be heading for a floor at the 53.00 mark.
 
Should it reach this point, there is a good chance that the ETH will be trading below $1,890.

On August 15, 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would end the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold. Since then, central banks around the world have started operating a fiat-based monetary system with floating exchange rates and no currency standards at all. The money supply has been rising steadily ever since. This forced market participants to look for ways to invest their money to protect against this inflation and one of the most popular investment assets has been real estate.
