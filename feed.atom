        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pro-freedom technologies advocate and software developer Jason Dreyzehner recently spoke with Bitcoin.com News via email about the upcoming Bitcoin Cash network upgrade on May 15. One of the most talked about improvement proposals set to go through on that date — which proponents view as a boon to economic freedom — is the Cashtokens CHIP. Beyond UTXO-level token creation, the upgrade will allow for “advanced on-chain applications like higher-security vaults, decentralized exchanges, and bridged sidechains,” comparable to ethereum, more scalable, and cheaper, according to Dreyzehner.

Although several lawyers from the XRP community had estimated the chances of a verdict by the end of April to be very high, Judge Torres of the District Court in the Southern District of New York has still not issued a ruling.
 
But a few hours ago, a rumor now surfaced on Twitter that could imply that a decision in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC is near. However, since this is an unconfirmed rumor from an anonymous source, it should be taken with a grain of salt.
 
The Twitter account Blockchain Daily stated that Ripple and the SEC are reportedly holding an undisclosed meeting on May 8. The speculation now circulating on Twitter is t…]]></summary>

Digital infrastructure provider Mawson Infrastructure Group Inc. (Mawson) has signed an agreement for a new site in Corning, Ohio, with an initial capacity of 24MW.
According to a press release, the site, signed on a long-term lease, has an additional 26MW of potential capacity upside, subject to further infrastructure investment, which would take the total site to 50MW. 
The site is expected to go live in Q3 2023 and will initially host 12 modular data centers (MDCs) and 7,056 miners. The new site will expand Mawson's potential capacity to up to 290MW, highlighting the company's focus on the Pennsylvania and Ohio region.
Mawson's CEO James Manning said, “This is the first of several smaller sites the Mawson team has been working on, with a focus to deploy low cost, quick to market mining facilities.” COO Liam Wilson added, “We are actively planning for the halving event, and plan to have the most efficient fleet possible — as always, focusing on shareholders return on capital. We are focused on this region for various reasons and look forward to seeing which ASIC units perform best before ordering in bulk.”
The new site is an addition to the existing 240MW of capacity that Mawson has online and under development in the surrounding area. The company's goal is to provide a possible increase in deployable hashrate of up to 1.0 EH/s. Mawson's infrastructure includes a proprietary modular data center (MDC) design that aims to reduce deployment time and capital expenditure.]]></summary>

Now Marco Santori, the company's chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
