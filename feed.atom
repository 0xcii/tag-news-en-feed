stablecoin issuers signals a significant shift in its financial oversight  
landscape. By implementing a robust framework, the city aims to safeguard

Initially, the government planned to impose a 20% tax on profits from crypto investments exceeding 2.5 million won (approximately $1,875) starting January 2023. This timeline was subsequently pushed to 2025, and now further delayed to 2028.
