Bitcoin Transaction Count Has Observed A Sharp Increase Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the BTC blockchain activity has significantly gone up recently. The indicator of interest here is the “transaction count,” which measures the total number of Bitcoin transactions taking place on the network right now.
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means the chain is seeing a high amount of usage from the holders. This kind of trend suggests traders are active in the market right now.
 
On the other hand, low values of the indicator suggest the BTC blockchain is seeing low activity currently. Such a trend can b…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-surges-to-strongest-point-since-november/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-22T16:02:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp moved to its highest point since November, as markets reacted to news suggesting a verdict could be near in Ripple’s case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Cardano was also higher on Wednesday, hitting a one-month high.
 
XRP
 
XRP rose to its highest point since November, as markets continued to react to the latest news surrounding Ripple’s case with the SEC.
 
Following a low of $0.4199 on Tuesday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4914 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the strongest point that the token has reached since November 6, when prices were retreating from a high above $0.50.
 
 
Overall, earlier gains have since eased, which comes as bulls failed to sustain a breakout on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 65.14, which is below the aforementioned ceiling at 70.00.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average remains in an uptrend despite the marginal decline, which sees XRP currently trading at $0.4459.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was once again higher in today’s session, as the token jumped to a one-month high.
 
ADA/USD moved to a peak of $0.387 on Wednesday, which comes a day after falling to a low at $0.349.
 
Today’s surge saw bulls push cardano to its highest level since February 23, when price was at a peak of $0.393.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that the climb coincided with the 10-day (red) moving average crossing over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the 14-day RSI is now tracking at 60.93, which is its highest reading since mid-February.
 
A ceiling at 53.00 may await for bulls should momentum continue in this current direction, which could put a stop to the run.

The proposed legislation seeks to prohibit the Federal Reserve from creating its own CBDC or supporting the development of any digital currency. The idea is to preserve the privacy of crypto investors throughout the country.
 
Ted Cruz Introduces CBDC Bill
 
This is not the first time Senator Cruz has attempted to block CBDCs. He previously introduced similar legislation in 2022 but failed to gain traction in Congress. However, with the increasing interest in CBDCs from central banks worldwide, including the Federal Reserve, Senator Cruz is renewing his efforts to prevent their implementation in the U.S.

In light of recent events, many in the Bitcoin community are looking for regulatory clarity now more than ever. Questions such as “who should regulate Bitcoin?” and “will the U.S. allow Bitcoin innovation or pursue a central bank digital currency (CBDC)?” are at the top of the list.

McGlone explained that the high-profile collapses of banks have raised concerns about the stability of the traditional financial system. This has led investors to seek out alternative assets, such as Bitcoin, that are not tied to traditional banking institutions.
 
As more investors seek to diversify their portfolios and hedge against potential economic downturns, the crypto’s unique properties, according to McGlone, make it an increasingly attractive option.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved closer to a fresh nine-month high on Wednesday, as markets prepared for today’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision. The Fed is expected to hike rates by 0.25%, despite inflation falling last month to 6%. Ethereum briefly rose above $1,800 in today’s session. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) closed in on a fresh nine-month high in today’s session, as markets continued to anticipate today’s Federal Reserve rate decision.
 
Following a low of $27,785.11 on Tuesday, BTC/USD surged to an intraday peak of $28,439.56 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move sees bitcoin move back towards a recent nine-month high, which was recorded earlier in the week.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This latest surge in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) attempted to break out of a ceiling at 72.00
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 71.70, which is its highest reading since early-February, and deep in overbought territory.
 
Traders are likely waiting for this afternoon’s announcement prior to attempting to move beyond this point.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also back in the green on Wednesday, following a brief stint of consolidation the day prior.
 
ETH/USD moved to a high of $1,836.29 on hump-day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,761.67.
 
Similar to bitcoin, Wednesday’s rally in price saw ETH near a recent high of $1,846, which is its strongest point since last August.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
The 10-day (red) moving average (MA) has continued to trend upwards, extending its crossover with the 25-day (blue) MA.
 
However, price strength seems to be a barrier to further gains, with the index now tracking below a ceiling at 64.00
 
In order for bulls to extend gains, there will likely need to be a breakout of the aforementioned resistance level.
