        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US  
prosecutors have fingered two Russian nationals as the masterminds behind the 2011 hack of  
Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin (BTC) exchange in the world at the time. The  
Department of Justice (DOJ) in an indictment unsealed on Friday, charged Alexey  
Bilyuchenko, 43, and Aleksandr Verner, 29, with conspiracy to launder about 647,000  
bitcoins following their hack of the  
exchange. 
DOJ Indicts Two Russian Nationals
According  
to the prosecutors, Bilyuchenko and Verner stole the vast majority of bitcoins  
belonging to Mt. Gox customers between September 2011 and at least May 2014. This contributed to the eventual shut down  
of the platform in February 2014. 
The DOJ in  
a statement unsealed charges against both Russian nationals in both New York  
and California, following ongoing multi-agency investigation into the case.  
This is even as the prosecutor accused Bilyuchenko of partnering with Alexander Vinnik to run  
another defunct Bulgaria-based cryptocurrency exchange, BTC-e, with ‘ill-gotten  
gains’ from his Mt. Gox hack.
BTC-e, according  
to the prosecutor, for years aided criminals across the world, ‘to launder  
billions of dollars.’ These included computer hackers, ransomware actors,  
narcotics rings and corrupt public officials.

Assange, who is wanted on 18 charges related to the release of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables, will, however, renew his appeal next week according to a report by Reuters. The British High Court ruled that Assange had no legal grounds to challenge the extradition decision.
Previously, a British judge ruled against Assange's extradition, citing concerns about his mental health and the risk of suicide if held in a maximum security prison. However, the decision was overturned on appeal after the U.S. authorities provided assurances, including the possibility of transferring Assange to Australia to serve any sentence.
