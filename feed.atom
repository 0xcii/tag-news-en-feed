In addition to bolstering the financial inclusion rate, the central bank claimed that the CBDC would “widen the size and stability of banks’ deposit base.”
 
Nigeria’s Financial Inclusion Rates
 
According to a new Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) study, the country’s nearly two-year-old e-naira central bank digital currency (CBDC) poses a risk to financial stability. This is despite the fact that such a digital currency can potentially help improve Nigeria’s “financial inclusion rate from 64.1 percent recorded in 2021 to the 95.0 percent target for 2024.”

Taking to X, the social media platform, Hoffman said Solana distributes roughly $1.8 million worth of SOL daily while only capturing a fraction in fees at approximately $40,000.

In blockchain, bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transferred every second. This figure varies with legacy networks, including Ethereum and Bitcoin, having some of the lowest in the sphere.

Worldcoin Achieves Milestone in Chile; More Than 1% of the Population Reportedly Registered
Worldcoin, the project that uses biometric iris scanning as “proof of personhood,” has reached a milestone in Chile. The organization reported having signed up 200,000 Chileans since its launch.

The Road To Re-Pegging USTC
 
A proposal was submitted to the Terra Classic community to stop the minting of USTC which was originally a stablecoin. The proposal which was submitted on September 14, 2023, asked that all minting and reminting of tokens should be halted unless the community approves it.
 
 
The proposal goes further into the mechanism of USTC such as in the case where users are able to use xUST to mint USTC. This would close one of the most impactful loopholes in the minting mechanism …]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-26T22:05:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a strongly-worded letter addressed to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, a group of prominent U.S. Congressmen are calling for the immediate approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). The bipartisan letter, signed by representatives Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), and Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.), emphasizes the urgency of expanding access to Bitcoin investment options and highlights the potential benefits for American investors.
"We write to ensure the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not continue to discriminate against spot bitcoin exchange traded products (ETPs)," the letter states. "The SEC is responsible for making certain that products that comply with investor protections are made available to investors." 
The lawmakers assert that spot Bitcoin ETFs would offer a regulated and secure way for investors to gain exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. Such ETFs would allow investors to buy and sell Bitcoin on traditional stock exchanges, simplifying the investment process and potentially attracting a broader range of participants.
One of the key points made in the letter is the need for regulatory clarity. The Congressmen argue that the absence of a spot Bitcoin ETF has led to investors seeking exposure through unregulated and potentially riskier avenues. Approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs would provide a clear regulatory framework for these investments.
"A regulated spot bitcoin ETP would provide increased protection for investors by making access to bitcoin safer and more transparent. Congress has a duty to ensure the SEC approves investment products that meet the requirements set out by Congress," says the letter.
The SEC seems to have responded to this call from Congress by delaying Cathie Wood's ARK Invest application early, which a decision was not due until November 11.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moneygram, a leading money transfer company, announced plans to launch its own non-custodial digital wallet in partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation. The wallet will enable users to convert between fiat and digital currencies when sending cross-border payments.
 
Moneygram Partners With Stellar to Launch Non-Custodial Digital Wallet
 
Set to launch in the first quarter of 2024, the new digital wallet will allow Moneygram customers to cash out their digital assets at any participating Moneygram location worldwide. Additionally, the wallet will let users send digital assets to other wallet users. However, privacy advocates might take issue with the fact that Moneygram will apply its compliance screening to all wallet users.
 
“Our vision to connect the world’s communities by empowering our customers through innovative financial solutions takes another step forward today,” said Alex Holmes, CEO of Moneygram. Holmes added, “The Moneygram non-custodial digital wallet advances this mission even further.”
 
Offered without fees until June 2024, the non-custodial wallet will use Stellar’s blockchain network and integrate with Moneygram’s existing fiat on- and off-ramps. Moneygram plans to expand the wallet’s capabilities after its launch, introducing new features that further connect global money transfers with blockchain payments.
 
Building on Moneygram’s 2022 ventures in the crypto space, the company launched a USDC crypto-to-cash program last June, allowing users to cash out digital currencies. In November, Moneygram began permitting customers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly within its money transfer app. The non-custodial wallet represents the company’s most recent effort to increase access to digital assets.
