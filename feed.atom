        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant development, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) convened with applicants seeking approval for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) today, according to Eleanor Terrett and Charles Gasparino of FOX Business. 



Terrett revealed sources who attended the meeting said the SEC was "making sure everyone is doing cash creates," and "asked issuers to remove all hints of in-kind redemptions from their filings." This meeting assumes paramount importance amid the ongoing discussions and evaluations regarding the approval of such ETFs.
Terrett's post hinted at the collaborative nature of the meeting, suggesting efforts to bring all stakeholders onto the same page regarding the nuances, prerequisites, and potential implications associated with their spot Bitcoin ETF applications. While details about all the specifics remain undisclosed, the meeting likely focused on addressing concerns, clarifying regulatory expectations, and streamlining the evaluation process for these ETF applications.
The SEC's engagement with applicants reflects a commitment to comprehensively assess the viability and regulatory compliance of the proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs. The outcome of this meeting could significantly influence the trajectory of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, potentially paving the way for a more structured framework for institutional participation in this burgeoning industry. 
As market participants await further developments, this meeting stands as a crucial milestone in the potential approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Yesterday, FOX Business reported that BlackRock made receiving an approval for their spot Bitcoin ETF a "key corporate priority," and that the ETFs will have a SEC decision by January 10.]]></summary>

Users of Phantom have the ability to integrate their existing bitcoin wallets, allowing them to manage their Bitcoin-centric digital collectibles and fungible tokens through the Web3 platform’s interface.
 
From Solana to Bitcoin: Phantom Wallet’s Latest Expansion Embraces Inscriptions and BRC20s
 
In 2023, Ordinals and BRC20 tokens, developed atop Bitcoin, have gained considerable traction, leading numerous companies to adopt the supporting infrastructure. As of December 21, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain boasts over 50 million inscriptions.
 
On Wednesday, Phantom, the Web3 wallet that secured $109 million in Series B funding from key investors last year, announced its foray into the Bitcoin realm. Phantom acknowledges Bitcoin’s foundational role, stating that without it, there would be no Solana, Ethereum, or Web3.
 
“Introducing Bitcoin on Phantom,” the company said in a post shared on X. “You can now buy, sell, trade, transfer, and HODL Bitcoin, Ordinals, and BRC20 tokens with your favorite multi-chain wallet.”
 
Phantom’s integration of Ordinals and BRC20s coincides with a surge in demand for Bitcoin digital collectibles and fungible tokens. Recent data from cryptoslam.io reveals that Bitcoin-based NFT sales have exceeded $400 million in the past week.
 
Phantom’s Bitcoin feature is currently in beta and available on an opt-in basis. Users can also link with the NFT marketplaces Magic Eden and Unisat, and Phantom indicates that additional “trusted” applications will be introduced shortly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a groundbreaking statement, Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Diana Mondino, has confirmed the country's stance on embracing Bitcoin for contractual agreements.



Mondino's declaration outlined the government's willingness to accept and formalize contracts denominated in Bitcoin, heralding a pivotal moment for legal recognition of BTC within Argentina. The move demonstrates Argentina's progressive approach towards integrating Bitcoin in the country.
"And also any other crypto and/or species such as kilos of steer or liters of milk," Mondino continued. "Art 766. - Obligation of the debtor. The debtor must deliver the corresponding amount of the designated currency, whether the currency is legal tender in the Republic or not."
This announcement arrives a month after Javier Milei, who has made very positive comments about Bitcoin in the past, won Argentina's presidential candidacy. Milei has previously stated, "The central bank is a scam, a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax.” Then saying Bitcoin "represents the return of money to its original creator, the private sector,” and that "it prevents politicians from robbing you through inflation."
The Minister's assertion further underlines Argentina's efforts to leverage the potential of Bitcoin to stimulate economic growth and innovation. By accepting Bitcoin as a valid form of contractual agreement, the government aims to foster an environment conducive to investment and business development within the country.
While the details regarding the implementation and legal nuances remain to be outlined, Mondino's statement marks a crucial step forward in legitimizing Bitcoin as a recognized means of conducting formal agreements within Argentina. The move may also serve as a catalyst, encouraging other nations to consider similar initiatives in integrating Bitcoin into their legal frameworks.]]></summary>
