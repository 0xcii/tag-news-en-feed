Doge-1 Satellite Rebooking Fee Paid In Dogecoin
 
The CEO of Geometric Energy, Samuel Reid, confirmed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that they “had” to repay the rebooking fee to Elon Musk’s SpaceX in DOGE. This suggests that his company had no other choice but to use the meme coin to pay if they still intended to move on with the Doge-1 mission.
 
 
While it is unclear why the payment in Dogecoin was mandatory, it was worth mentioning that Geometric Energy made the initial payment (in 2021) to launch the Doge-1 satellite in Dogecoin. As such, S…]]></summary>

A Rare Bitcoin Buy Signals Prints
 
According to a crypto analyst on X, the ADX/DI indicator formed a bullish crossover on the monthly chart for the first time in eight years. The trend and momentum-following tool is used mainly because of its ability to identify trend strength and potential reversals. 
 
 
Sharing a chart, the analyst noted that the current formation is “eerily similar” in structure to when the same pattern was printed in 2016. Following this pattern in 2016, Bitcoin prices floated higher the next year, sparked by…]]></summary>

Most attributed this drop to curtailment activity in Texas. While Texas does represent 17% of the global bitcoin hashrate, ERCOT data shows that some of the curtailment activity was a combination of higher prices and “good grid citizenship.” In ERCOT, and to a lesser extent in other ISOs, prices are the best proxy for grid stress. There are other proxies such as PRC (physical responsive capability) but prices are a better measure for most situations. For that reason, in order to prevent swings in prices and create more challenging gird conditions, an optimal environment is one in which the price does not swing wildly up and down.
