        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a significant spike in a major metric, which signals a bullish outlook for the second-largest meme coin by market cap. Despite this, Shiba Inu’s price has failed to react positively, which can undoubtedly be a concern for token holders. 
 
Shibarium Sees Increase In Active Accounts 
 
Data from Shibariumscan shows that the number of active accounts on the layer-2 network rose from 1290 on April 27 to 3,839 on April 28, representing over a 144% increase. Such development is bullish for Shiba Inu, considering how the layer-2 network has been integral to the meme coin’s success since it launched last year.

Previously, Bitcoin transfers on Coinbase were processed on-chain, which often took a “significant” amount of time, ranging from 10 minutes to 2 hours, and was more expensive.
