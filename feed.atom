        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Puell Multiple is close to setting new highs for 2023, a sign that a top may be becoming more likely for BTC.
 
Bitcoin 7-Day MA Puell Multiple Has Surged Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Puell Multiple is currently at the second highest level for the year. The “Puell Multiple” is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the daily Bitcoin miner revenue and the 365-day moving average (MA) of the same.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the miners are currently earning more than the average for the past year. On the other hand, the indicator being below the mark suggests these chain validators are making less than usual right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On November 19, 2023, Argentine voters elected Javier Gerardo Milei, an Austrian economist known for his candid and unconventional style, as their new president. He ran on a platform promising substantial reforms: cutting spending, reducing government intervention, addressing inflation, and eliminating the central bank.
Milei's path to victory was unexpected. In the general elections, he secured second place with 30% of the vote, trailing Sergio Massa of the Peronist establishment, who garnered 37%. Patricia Bullrich, former Minister of Security under President Macri's administration, obtained 24%. These results forced Balotaje, or a run-off election between Massa and Milei.
On the run-off election night, it became apparent early on that Massa's camp wouldn't prevail, leading him to conced…]]></summary>
