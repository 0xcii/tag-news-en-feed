        <updated>2023-12-07T20:34:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the notable appearance of a mega whale on December 4, another block reward from the Satoshi era was moved on December 7, at a block height of 820,156. This transaction marks the 21st block reward from 2010 to be spent in the initial week of December.
 
Sleeping Bitcoin Stash Stirs After a Decade
 
On Thursday, December 7, 2023, a dormant stash of 50 bitcoin (BTC) stirred into action for the first time in over ten years. This movement of the so-called ‘sleeping bitcoins’ was detected by the blockchain parsing platform btcparser.com. Echoing the activity seen on December 4, where a series of 20 blocks were utilized, the original address divided the funds between two separate Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) addresses.
 
The originating address, known as “18JkK,” was established on July 24, 2010. From this, it transferred 1 BTC to the address labeled “32Xas” and a further 48.99 BTC to “3DD4X.” Nevertheless, the transaction was conspicuous in terms of privacy, garnering a low privacy score of 5 out of 100 from Blockchair’s privacy analysis tool. This was attributed to identifiable issues like matched inputs and outputs.
 
While the transfer of 50 BTC may seem modest compared to the 1,000 BTC moved by the spender of 20 block rewards on December 4, its current value of $2.18 million is striking, especially when contrasted with its July 2010 worth of just $15. Moreover, instances of moving bitcoins from 2010 have become notably scarce in 2023, with more frequent sightings of 2012-era bitcoins.
 
 
The specific block reward, number 69,986, spent on that Thursday marked its first movement in over a decade. Importantly, it wasn’t part of the collection of block rewards linked to Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Notably, Satoshi was active during that July but departed the community permanently in December 2010.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tether, the leading stablecoin by market capitalization, has seen its supply increase by 5.5% in the last month, achieving a significant market valuation of $90 billion.
 
Since 2015, Tether’s Market Cap Has Swelled by 35,912,812%
 
Since the dawn of 2023, tether (USDT) has experienced substantial growth. Starting the year with a market value of $66.3 billion on January 1, 2023, it has surged to $90 billion in 340 days. This expansion represents more than a 35% increase, adding $23.7 billion to USDT’s market capitalization since the year’s commencement.
 
Tether’s market capitalization now represents 5.369% of the total $1.68 trillion crypto economy. Not only does tether hold the third position among over 10,000 digital currencies in terms of market valuation, but it also leads in daily trading volume with $23 billion. USDT’s principal trading pairs involve major fiat currencies such as the USD, EUR, TRY, MXN, and THB.
 
While year-to-date data indicates a more than 35% rise in USDT’s market cap, 5.5% of this upswing occurred in the preceding month. According to Tether’s transparency page, of the $90 billion total, the Tron network accounts for $47.82 billion and Ethereum for $41.01 billion, with the remainder distributed across various other blockchain platforms.
 
 
Looking back to March 16, 2015, USDT’s market value was a modest $251,000. Over eight years, the coin’s market cap has soared by a massive 35,912,812%. Tether’s aggregate market valuation is on the brink of entering the world’s top 100 assets, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and companies, in terms of market capitalization. In order to achieve this feat, USDT will need a market cap of more than $130 billion.
