        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paris-based Bubblemaps, a firm specializing in blockchain data visualization, announced on Monday that it had secured $3.2 million in seed funding from a group of investors. Bubblemaps stated that the newly acquired funds would be directed toward a mission to increase access to blockchain data, serving both individuals and institutions.
 
Bubblemaps Raises $3.2M to Boost Blockchain Data Access
 
Bubblemaps secured $3.2 million in a seed funding round, with INCE Capital leading the investment effort. Other contributors to the fundraising initiative included Cronos Chain, Avalanche, V3ntures, Momentum 6, Lbank, Stake Capital, and others.
 
“We’ve successfully raised €3M to accelerate blockchain data innovation,” announced Bubblemaps on the social media platform X.
 
The platform offers users vibrant bubble visualizations linked to onchain data for blockchains, decentralized finance (defi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Bubblemaps dubs the platform the “first supply auditing tool for defi tokens and NFTs.” Bubblemaps has established partnerships with various blockchain projects, including Polygon, Fantom, Cronos, BNB, Arbitrum, and Avalanche.
 
 
In the past two years, companies specializing in blockchain and crypto-related analytics have secured substantial investments. In August 2021, Messari raised $21 million, while just a few months earlier in May, Coin Metrics obtained $15 million. February 2022 witnessed Dune Analytics raising $69.4 million, and the preceding month, Cryptoslam secured $9 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With a market valuation of almost $520 billion and a current price of $26,690, Bitcoin has reclaimed the limelight. It now accounts for more than half of the entire cryptocurrency market.
 
This turning point is important because it occurs at a time when many alternative cryptocurrencies are stagnating or declining. It’s worth noting, though, that Bitcoin is still nearly 5% lower than its June high and 23% below than its January 2022 peak, despite the recent uptick.
 
Looking at the market more broadly, the alpha coin’s market dominance ranged between nearly 40% and 49% for more than two years before it finally reached the 52% level in June, when asset manager BlackRock’s application for a spot BTC exchange-traded fund sparked expectations about releasing significant inflows into the asset…]]></summary>

The MFSA has launched a public consultation until 29 September on the proposed changes.
Crypto Regulations in Malta
Malta was one of the early jurisdictions to adopt crypto regulations with the establishment of its Virtual Financial Assets (VFA) framework in 2018, aiming to attract companies in the booming industry to the island. Although some big names initially moved to Malta, the program failed to attract the masses.
Now, the proposed changes to align its requirements with MiCA will ease many existing rules. One of the highlighted changes is removing the systems aud…]]></summary>

Late Monday’s announcement signified a pivotal alteration to the list that enumerates approved tokens for DFS-licensed firms.
 
Prior, this greenlist boasted 25 tokens, including heavyweight names such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, XRP, and the emergent PayPal Dollar. However, post yesterday’s overhaul, the roster has been notably truncated, spotlighting only eight tokens. Remarkably Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the only non-pegged coins, besides Gemini Dollar (GUSD), GMO JPY (GYEN), GMO USD (ZUSD), Pax Gold (PAXG), Pax Dollar…]]></summary>
