        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data shows that the Bitcoin miners’ revenue from transaction fees has dropped 90% as the BRC-20 token frenzy has slowed.
 
Bitcoin Miners Are Now Making Just $1.7 Million In Transaction Fees
 
Bitcoin miners earn revenue through two main sources: the block rewards they receive for solving blocks on the network and the transaction fees they earn for handling individual transfers.
 
In the last couple of years, the latter’s contribution towards the total revenue had been quite small, meaning that the miners had to survive on the block rewards alone.
 
Recently, however, the transaction fee revenue of these chain validators observed explosively high values, thanks to the BRC-20 tokens frenzy that had taken over the market.
 
Generally, the transfer fee remains low when there is little traffic…]]></summary>

Australians traded bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies at discount on Binance Australia compared to other exchanges operating in the country on Tuesday.

The event will increase the circulating supply of OP tokens by over 100%. Analysts opine that the upcoming unlock event might affect OP’s price negatively.
 
OP Price Might Dip As Early Investors Cash In
 
Token unlocks in the crypto market are scheduled events that release early investors’ locked tokens after freezing them for a specific period. 
 
Crypto communities use token locks to avoid large asset sales in low liquidity periods. Selling during these periods could have an impact on the price of the token.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dr. Saifedean Ammous, prominent economist and author of "The Bitcoin Standard," is poised to take on a new role as an Economic Advisor to El Salvador's Bitcoin Office. This appointment comes after El Salvador made history by becoming the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021.
“Having Saifedean Ammous on team El Salvador is fantastic,” Max Keiser, Senior Bitcoin Advisor to the country said in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine. “Ammous brilliantly captured the role of Bitcoin as, ‘The alternative to Central Banking’ in his now classic, ‘The Bitcoin Standard’ as well as the philosophy of Bitcoin including popularizing the idea of 'time preference' as a life-hack. This news makes me very happy.”
Ammous, known for his expertise in Bitcoin and monetary economics, is expected to provide valuable guidance and insights to the Bitcoin Office as it navigates the implementation and integration of Bitcoin into the country's economy. His extensive knowledge and research on the subject have earned him recognition within the community and beyond.
The Bitcoin Law, proposed by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele and approved by the Legislative Assembly, has set the stage for a new era in the country's financial landscape. With Ammous joining as an Economic Advisor, El Salvador aims to leverage his expertise to maximize the benefits and address potential challenges associated with adopting bitcoin as legal tender.
The Bitcoin Office, established to oversee the implementation of the Bitcoin Law, will likely benefit from Ammous' insights on monetary policy, sound money principles and the potential economic implications of embracing a decentralized digital currency. His appointment signals El Salvador's commitment to incorporating expert opinions into their strategy and decision-making process.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP rallied to a six-week high in today’s session, as the token extended a recent bull run to a sixth day. Prices have risen by as much as 10% in that period, with the latest surge sending the cryptocurrency above $0.50. Solana was also higher, hitting a multi-week high of its own.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly known as ripple, was one of the biggest movers in cryptocurrency markets on Tuesday, as it rose above $0.50.
 
XRP/USD raced to a peak of $0.5049 earlier in today’s session, after starting the week trading at a low of $0.4779.
 
As a result of this surge, the token moved to its strongest point since April 19, when it hit a high of $0.5390.
 
 
Today’s rally has also led to the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hitting its highest reading since March 31.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 67.55, which is marginally below a ceiling of 68.00.
 
In the event this upcoming ceiling is broken, there is a reasonable chance that XRP moves closer to March’s high.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was also in the green, as it moved close to a key resistance level of $21.50.
 
After trading at a low of $20.30 during Monday’s session, SOL/USD bulls took the token to a high of $21.37 today.
 
This surge saw SOL hit its highest level since May 8, when the token was trading above $21.80.
 
 
Following recent gains, solana is now trading 7% higher than at the same point last week, with today’s rally sending the RSI to a ceiling at 55.00.
 
As of writing, the index is hovering marginally below this point, which has resulted in a drop from today’s peak.
 
Bulls will firstly need to overcome the ceiling at 55.00, and should they achieve this, SOL will likely move above $22.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Umbrel, the company behind umbrelOS, has introduced a new home server solution called Umbrel Home with the intent of providing users control over their data, privacy and digital lives, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Priced at $699, Umbrel Home is aimed at making self-hosting accessible to everyone. By leveraging umbrelOS, users can eliminate the need for third-party cloud services by utilizing a wide range of self-hosted apps available in the Umbrel App Store including a Bitcoin/Lightning node, Nextcloud, Plex and Home Assistant.
 
         
         
         
         
    
According to the press release, Umbrel Home offers accelerated performance, featuring a 2.9GHz Quad-Core Intel CPU, 2TB NVMe SSD, 16GB dual-channel RAM, and an active cooling system while consuming just 10 watts of power. This compact home server outperforms a Raspberry Pi 4-based solution in terms of CPU performance, SSD read and write speeds, RAM and memory bandwidth the release states.
Mayank Chhabra, Umbrel's Co-founder and CEO, highlighted the company's vision for Umbrel Home, saying that "Building a plug-and-play home server that was specifically engineered for umbrelOS has been our dream since day one. With the recent challenges in Raspberry Pi pricing and supply chain, we knew it was time to bring our vision to life, set a new benchmark in self-hosting, and make it accessible to users of all skill levels."
With privacy and data ownership concerns on the rise, self-hosting presents a modern solution that allows users to take ownership of their data, storage, access and sharing. In addition, Umbrel Home’s zero-configuration and one-click app installations from the Umbrel App Store make it easy to build a customized ecosystem tailored to individual needs.
Pre-orders for Umbrel Home are now available on umbrel.com, with shipping set to begin in June 2023. With its exceptional performance, user-friendly features and affordability, Umbrel Home aims to make self-hosting accessible to a global audience.]]></summary>
