        <updated>2024-04-15T21:07:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven consecutive weeks of inflows totaling $12.3 billion, the cryptocurrency market saw a significant shift. CoinShares reported roughly $942 million in outflows in its latest report, marking the first outflow following the notable inflow streak.
 
In addition, despite trading volumes remaining high at $28 billion for the week, it represents a substantial decline compared to the prior week, according to the report.
 
 
Investors Show Reticence Amid Price Declines
 
According to Coinshares Head of Research, James Butterfill, the recent price correction from the overall crypto market led to a decrease of $10 billion in total assets under management (AuM). However, they still exceed previous cycle highs, reaching $88 billion.
