Ethereum Faces Criticism
 
Celebrated for his insights into financial markets, Peter Brandt spared no punches as he castigated Ethereum, arguing that it lacks the essential characteristics required for long-term success.
 
 
His remarks underscored ETH’s perceived weaknesses as a store of value and its struggles with layer-2 solutions and high gas fees, factors he believes contribute to its inferiority compared to Bitcoin.
 
To support his assertions, Brandt posted an Ethereum/Bitcoin price chart and his criticism of ETH, showing the asset’s consistent decline relative to Bitcoin in the past …]]></summary>

If adoption projections are anything to go by, the figure could exponentially increase in the coming months, possibly propping up ADA prices.  
 
Cardano Treasury Rising: Bullish For Development
 
The Cardano Treasury exists by design. It serves as a war chest to fund ongoing development. 
 
 
A fixed amount of ADA is set aside per epoch—that is when a block of transactions is confirmed—and sent to the treasury. Every epoch is completed roughly after five days.

As we approach the conclusion of the third epoch, the countdown to the next Bitcoin halving is firmly underway. The halving (also known as the “Halvening”) is one of the most important and innovative features of Bitcoin. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network issues new bitcoin and approximately every four years (every 210,000 blocks, to be precise) the amount issued (the “block subsidy”) is cut in half. The block subsidy is the reward miners receive for validating and recording new transactions on the blockchain.
The halving of the block subsidy is a critical factor in bitcoin’s eventual capped supply of 21 million bitcoin. In addition, miners also collect transaction fees that users attach to their transactions to encourage miners to include them in the next block. Therefore …]]></summary>
