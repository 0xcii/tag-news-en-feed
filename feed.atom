        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid the banking chaos of the 21st century, some are looking back more than 600 years ago, to the Medici Bank — one of the most powerful banks of its time. It established its business and became one of the most respected banks in Europe during its prime, and the prominent Italian family of bankers were early adopters of fractional reserve banking, a practice that Medici Bank customers were unaware of, and that ultimately led to the financial institution’s failure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Statistics recorded on April 15, 2023, show that the number of coins in circulation for the stablecoin BUSD dropped below the 7 billion range to 6.68 billion, marking the lowest number of BUSD in circulation since April 2021. Furthermore, data indicates that the supply of BUSD has shrunk by 19.8% over the past 30 days.
 
BUSD Stablecoin Supply Hits Lowest Point in Two Years
 
BUSD, which was once among the largest stablecoins, remains the third-largest USD-pegged token. However, on February 13, 2023, Paxos announced that the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) had directed the company to stop issuing BUSD. On that day, around 16.1 billion BUSD tokens were in circulation, and since then, 9.42 billion stablecoins have been redeemed.

This proposal looked to overturn the unpopular decision of Arbitrum’s Foundation to transfer $1 billion worth of governance tokens to itself despite not receiving the DAO’s approval.
 
Arbitrum, the largest Layer 2 network by TVL, is now governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which voted largely against AIP-1.05. According to certain reports, some governance token holders saw the proposal as too unrealistic and ‘myopic’.
