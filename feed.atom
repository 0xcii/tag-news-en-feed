Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply 30-Day Change Has Been Negative Recently
 
As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the BTC long-term holder supply hasn’t been showing any signs of growth recently. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have held onto their coins for over 155 days.
 
 
The LTHs comprise one of the two main divisions of the BTC market based on holding time, with the other cohorts being known as the “short-term holders” (STHs).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a scathing assessment of Bitcoin, the largest digital asset by market capitalization, popular crypto analyst and trader Mags has warned BTC investors, highlighting that the crypto asset may drop as low as $50,000 in the short term.
 
Will Bitcoin Drop To $50,000 Soon?
 
Mags has identified a crucial element that Bitcoin must manage to avert a drop below the $50,000 price level. This warning comes amidst a wave of pessimism and increased uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market, which has experienced sharp swings and an overall negative view in recent weeks.
 
 
The analyst bases his forecast on the long-term trend of Bitcoin around the range low, which may result in a rise or a fall in value. According to Mags, the digital asset is testing the range low for the fifth time since March.
