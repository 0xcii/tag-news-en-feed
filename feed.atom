Despite the double appearance of the deadly sounding technical trigger, it might not spell certain doom for ETHUSD, as we’ll explain.
 
What To Expect From The Ethereum Double Death Cross
 
All eyes are now on Ethereum as another 1W death cross has appeared. The signal comes just weeks after a weekly golden cross, which immediately followed the first ever death cross in ETHUSD.
 
A death cross usually tells long-term trend traders that the trend will soon be pointed downward, and generates a sell signal in a moving average (MA) crossover trading system.

This will result in hyperinflation, a spike in interest rates to compensate for the loss of purchasing power, and falling asset prices, further accelerating U.S. decline,” he described.

They carry out their nefarious ways by releasing counterfeit tokens across various blockchain networks.
 
As of Tuesday, data from DEXTools reveals that more than 66 counterfeit tokens have emerged on networks such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Base. The majority of these bogus tokens have been introduced on Ethereum, where the genuine PYUSD token is established.

Argentine Peso Bleeds as Investors Take Cover in U.S. Dollars
The Argentine peso plunged to new historic lows Monday, less than a week before the PASO elections, in which parties elect their representatives for the October general ballotage. The Argentine fiat currency reached 597 units per dollar on its free “blue” exchange rate, jumping 22 pesos in just one day.

This latest lawsuit adds to a long list of legal battles directly or indirectly to the defunct crypto exchange. 
 
Was Fenwick & West LLP In On All Of It?
 
FTX’s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), had previously hired the legal services of Fenwick & West LLP in a move to strengthen his defense. The California-based law firm acted as the primary outside counsel for the defunct FTX US.
