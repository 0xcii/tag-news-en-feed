After a lull of slightly over six years, an individual splurged 359.92 BTC, equivalent to $9.2 million, across eight distinct transactions. Moreover, on Wednesday, September 6, an untouched trove of 500 bitcoins was mobilized for the first time in nearly seven years.
 
Dormant for Years, $21 Million in ‘Sleeping Bitcoins’ Spring to Life
 
Many bitcoin enthusiasts keep their coins tucked away for years, sometimes even spanning decades. However, at the owner’s discretion, these dormant bitcoins occasionally see the light of day, either being spent or shifted for various motives.

In that now-famous article, penned for The New York Times on September 7, 2011, Krugman criticized and dismissed the cryptocurrency, which was then trading at an average of $7.03 per Bitcoin across exchanges. 
Fast forward to today, and Bitcoin's remarkable journey has proven Krugman's skepticism to be one of the most costly missed opportunities in financial history, as demonstrated by the reaction to an X post today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo.
When Krugman's article was published, Bitcoin was still in its infancy. The digital money, created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, had only been around for a couple of years. It was largely unknown to the mai…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was a notable gainer in today’s session, as the cryptocurrency rose for a second straight session. The global market cap is marginally higher at the time of writing, as prices mostly consolidated. Solana retreated from a near one-week high.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was in the green for a second session running, following a bounce from a recent point of support.
 
Price rallied to a peak of $0.000007757 earlier in the day, which comes after Tuesday’s low at $0.0000076.
 
As referenced earlier, the surge occurred after SHIB bears rejected a breakout below a price floor at the $0.00000735 mark.
 
 
This came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also avoided a drop of its own, near support of 35.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 39.07, with the next point of resistance around 43.00.
 
Should bulls manage to push the price closer to the aforementioned zone, there is a good chance SHIB can climb over $0.00000800.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
After trading close to a one-week high earlier in the session, solana (SOL) retreated from this point, falling under $20.00 in the process.
 
SOL/USD moved to a bottom at $19.41 on Wednesday, a day after it hit an intraday high of $20.55.
 
The decline sees solana now on the cusp of colliding with a support point at the $19.00 mark, which has been the floor for the past two months.
 
 
Today’s downtrend came as the RSI was unable to break out of a resistance zone of 44.00, falling to a current reading of 38.97 instead.
 
In the event that momentum remains bearish in the coming days, a target of 36.00 could act as a level of stability.
