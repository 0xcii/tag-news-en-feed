Wang visited the luxury complex, which also operated as living quarters for some of FTX’s staff, two months before the company went bankrupt. At that time, Sam Bankman Fried was still a champion for the industry and a poster boy for “effective altruism” and the “next Warren B…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-postpones-verdict-on-ark-21shares-and-global-x-spot-bitcoin-etfs/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-27T16:09:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. securities regulator recently announced a delay in its verdict on the Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF. Consequently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has marked January 10, 2024, as the decisive day to either greenlight or reject the proposed amendment.
 
SEC Pushes Back Decision on 2 Spot Bitcoin ETFs
 
A statement from the U.S. securities authority highlighted its decision to push back its judgment on the Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF, an asset-backed fund aiming for public listing. The filing for this ETF was jointly presented by Cboe BZX Exchange, 21shares, and Ark Invest on April 25, 2023.
 
This ETF joined the ranks of several spot bitcoin ETF applications, with industry giants like Invesco, Blackrock, Fidelity, Vaneck, Valkyrie, Wisdomtree, and Franklin Templeton all in the queue. Notably, the SEC had previously postponed its decision on seven of these filings, including the Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF, on August 31, 2023.
 
Upon a detailed examination of the proposal and subsequent modifications, the SEC said on Tuesday that it chose to prolong the evaluation phase to guarantee a comprehensive review. “The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 3, and the issues raised therein,” the SEC detailed.
 
 
“I’m shocked they went this early on Ark and 21Shares. My assumption is they’re worried about the government shutdown and trying to get ahead of that,” Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said on Tuesday. In addition to the Ark 21shares filing, the securities watchdog also deferred its decision on the spot bitcoin ETF filing submitted by Global X and its listing partner Cboe BZX.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent comments by Danny Ryan, often referred to as the beacon chain’s mastermind, have sent ripples through the Ethereum community. In a candid interview, Ryan called out Lido and similar protocols, claiming they pose a systemic threat to Ethereum’s foundational values and its core consensus mechanisms.
 
The crux of Ryan’s concern revolves around Lido’s growth. Lido has now amassed nearly one-third of all ETH staked. In the world of consensus mechanisms, surpassing thresholds like one-third or half gives a participant significant influence, potentially enabling them to disrupt consensus in fatal ways. This doesn’t just signify a potential centralization risk; it could erode Ethereum’s value proposition as a decentralized platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash was once again a big mover, as the cryptocurrency rose by nearly 10% during today’s session. The move saw price climb to its highest level since mid-August, and came as U.S. dollar strength pushed the S&P 500 to a three-month low. Chainlink also rallied strongly on Wednesday.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) continued to climb higher for a third straight session on Wednesday, as prices surged by nearly 10% in today’s session.
 
BCH/USD peaked at $234.94 earlier in the day, which comes a day after falling to a low of $211.95.
 
This is the strongest point that the token has hit since August 10, when price was trading above $240.00.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came following a breakout of a point of resistance at the $225.00 level.
 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) also broke out of a ceiling at 60.00, and is now tracking at 65.52.
 
The next target now seems to be at the $250.00 mark, which could be hit if current momentum extends for the remainder of the week.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
In addition to BCH, chainlink (LINK) was also in the green on Wednesday, rising to a multi-week high of its own.
 
After falling to a low of $7.26 on Tuesday, LINK/USD surged to an intraday high of $7.82 during today’s session.
 
Like with bitcoin cash above, today’s peak pushed the cryptocurrency to its highest level since August 9.
 
 
Overall, the rise occurred as price strength moved past a resistance level of 67.00, with a current reading of 67.22.
 
LINK bulls are now likely looking to hit a ceiling of $8.00, as the 10-day (red) moving average maintains a recent uptrend.

But mainstream economics research has tended to downplay the importance of energy in economic growth.

If energy is so important to any and every economy, why is it so aggressively avoided in research and discussion? Going further, why such heavy over politicization and division in the industry?

The Byzantine Generals Problem is a game theory problem that reveals the challenges of achieving consensus among a group of mutually suspicious entities using unreliable communication channels. Game theory refers to the best strategy adopted by independent and competing actors in decision-making.
This article explores the concept of the Byzantine Generals Problem, its foundation, how it applies to networked systems and money, and how Bitcoin’s combination of its different elements enables the best-suited consensus to resolve the issue.
The Byzantine Generals Problem is particularly experienced in distributed computing, where it’s more difficult for decentralized parties to reach a consensus without relying on a trusted central party.
