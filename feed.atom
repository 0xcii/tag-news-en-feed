        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foundation Devices, a leader in Bitcoin-centric tools, has announced the launch of its Envoy mobile app as a standalone Bitcoin mobile wallet with enhanced features for account management and privacy.
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, this update is part of Foundation's mission to make digital sovereignty more accessible and to lower the barriers to bitcoin self-custody. The new Envoy app introduces what Foundation is calling “Envoy Magic Backups,” a simplified setup and backup process for mobile wallets. The press release described how users can now start using the wallet in just 60 seconds without seed words and easily restore their wallet on any device with a few taps.
Zach Herbert, Co-Founder and CEO of Foundation, expressed his excitement about the update, stating, "With this update, we are excited to bring our best-in-class design, intuitive and approachable user experience, and peace of mind to smartphone users across the globe — no Passport required." 
In addition to the introduction of the Envoy app, Foundation has also announced a price reduction for its Passport hardware wallet, now priced at $199. Customers who ordered within the last 90 days are eligible to claim a $50 gift card for the Foundation store. 
Alongside this, Foundation released a major update to the Passport hardware wallet, introducing the Key Manager extension that enables powerful new tools such as child seeds and Nostr keys.
Herbert emphasized Foundation's commitment to accessibility, stating, "Foundation is committed to making Bitcoin and decentralized technologies accessible to everyone. These updates mark significant advancements in our mission to empower individuals to reclaim their digital sovereignty."]]></summary>

This new offering allows users to make one fee-free bitcoin purchase per month for up to 100 CHF/EUR. By offering a zero-fee purchase option to its user base of over 70,000 individuals, Relai hopes to encourage more individuals to explore the benefits of owning bitcoin and participating in the digital economy.
Julian Liniger, Relai CEO and co-founder, expressed his excitement about the new offering in a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, stating, "We are thrilled to offer our users the zero fee purchase option. It's a testament to our commitment to simplifying Bitcoin investments and making it accessible to everyone." He further emphasized the importance of providing fair and secure access to bitcoin, calling it the "best savings technology ever invented."
In addition to the zero-fee trading launch, Relai explained that it recently made improvements to its user interface, making it even easier for users to onboard and use core functions like buying and selling. The press release states that these efforts have contributed to the company's success, with March 2023 being its best month to date according to the company. Relai reported a 215% year-on-year revenue growth since March 2022, along with a 53% increase compared to February 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin rose to a one-week high on Wednesday, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly moving lower. As of writing, the global crypto market cap is trading nearly 1% lower. Xrp also surged, climbing by over 6% in today’s session.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was able to climb to a one-week high in today’s session, despite markets mostly trending lower.
 
Following a low of $0.07177 on Tuesday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.07422 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s rally saw dogecoin climb for a second straight session, which pushed the meme coin to its highest point since May 8.
 
 
As a result of the move, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a key resistance level of 40.00.
 
Although the index has moved marginally above this point, and is currently tracking at 40.40, DOGE has lost slight momentum.
 
The meme coin is now trading at $0.073, which is relatively lower than today’s earlier high.
 
 
XRP
 
Another notable gainer on Wednesday was XRP, formerly ripple, which rose by as much as 6% today.
 
XRP/USD rose to a peak at $0.4596 earlier in the day, which follows on from a low of $0.4202 during yesterday’s session.
 
This has resulted in the token climbing for a fourth consecutive day, reaching its strongest level since May 7.
 
 
Looking at the chart, and similar to DOGE, a collision has occurred on the RSI, with a failure to break a wall at 48.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is at the 47.33 mark, with the price now at $0.4457.
 
Should this point be broken, there is a good chance that XRP could be heading to a resistance of $0.48350.

Congress continues to negotiate terms of a potential increase to the limit, before the U.S. government runs out of cash on June 1. Ethereum also dropped, breaking out of the $1,800 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved below the $27,000 level on Wednesday, following yesterday’s U.S. Retail Sales report.
 
BTC/USD moved to a low of $26,785.41 earlier in today’s session, which was following Tuesday’s peak at $27,223.07.
 
Today’s sell-off comes as bitcoin was unable to move beyond its key price ceiling at the $27,300 mark, leading to a shift in bearish sentiment.
