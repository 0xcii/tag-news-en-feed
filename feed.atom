Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain took to X (formerly Twitter) recently to unveil two Satoshi-era whale wallets which have been inert for 10.7 years suddenly showing signs of activity. The on-chain data analysis tool disclosed that the anonymous whale wallets, identified as “16vRqA” and “1DUJuH” had cumulatively transferred a total of 1,000 BTC valued at $60.9 million in the span of 20 minutes.

users can deposit their coins to earn rewards,  has intensified  
competition among exchanges in South Korea, The Korea Times reported. This service has

Crypto Staking Gain Momentum
Staking services, where investors deposit their coins  
to validate blockchain networks and receive rewards, have recently gained traction in  
the cryptocurrency market. Unlike traditional bank deposits, exchanges do not  
manage the coins but act as proxies and charge brokerage fees for the service.

While the government boasts billions of dollars in transactions and enthusiastic city trials, a closer look reveals a hurdle – a lukewarm reception from the very people it’s meant to serve.
 
 
Digital Yuan: Early Adopters Turn Away
 
A recent report by the South China Morning Post throws cold water on the e-CNY’s immediate success. State employees in some cities, receiving a portion of their salaries in digital yuan, are quickly converting it back to cash. The reasons? A lack of incentive and practicality.
 
Sammy Lin, an account manager at a Chinese state bank, said:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[El Salvador made history in 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender under the leadership of President Nayib Bukele. This groundbreaking decision has enabled significant financial improvements across the small Central American nation. 
Yesterday, El Salvador launched its website to track its national Bitcoin treasury holdings to further its commitment to Bitcoin transparency.

JUST IN: 🇸🇻 El Salvador released a new website that tracks their #Bitcoin Treasury.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 13, 2024
 
 
 
The platform is hosted at bitcoin.gob.sv, provides real-time data on the nation's bitcoin reserves. 
Using public information from Bukele's tweets and blockchain data, the site details how the country has accumulated over 5,748 BTC worth roughly $360 million. 
This stash has been built up since 2021 through daily purchases of 1 BTC, larger bulk buys, and mining via geothermal energy.
Earlier, Bukele had released a Bitcoin address for people to monitor the nation's holdings. Now, the new website validates this information and offers public proof of reserves. 
Launching this platform represents a major step towards financial transparency in government operations.By leveraging Bitcoin's innate audibility, El Salvador continues leading the way.

Despite short-term fluctuations, the country already sits on $57 million in unrealized profit due to effective dollar cost averaging.
El Salvador's Bitcoin treasury tracker promotes openness and confidence in its pioneering Bitcoin strategy. 
This economic experiment and embrace of Bitcoin set an example for other nations to follow. The website should also help attract further Bitcoin investment and innovation in El Salvador.]]></summary>
