        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After climbing by over 20% on Friday, litecoin extended gains to start the weekend, surging to its highest point in over a year. The move comes as momentum surrounding the token’s listing on EDX markets continues to grow. Dogecoin also recorded a strong start to the day.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 

 
Litecoin (LTC) was once again a big mover in cryptocurrency markets, as the token rallied to a multi-month high.
 

 
Following a low of $91.73 during Friday’s session, LTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $111.76 earlier today.
 

 
As a result of the rally, litecoin peaked at its strongest point since April 7 last year, when price reached a top at $116.00.
 

 

 

 
After breaking out of a ceiling at 61.00 on the relative strength index (RSI), LTC bulls took the index past yet another ceiling.
 

 
This time at the 68.00 level, with price strength peaking at 73.91 to start the weekend, which is its highest point since January.
 

 
Litecoin has since gone on to retreat from today’s high, and as of writing, is trading at $110.17.
 

 

 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 

 
Another notable gainer on Saturday was dogecoin (DOGE), which climbed to a three-week high to start the weekend.
 

 
DOGE/USD jumped to a peak of $0.07079 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after falling to $0.06264.
 

 
The move saw the world’s largest meme coin jump nearly 5% higher, hitting its highest level since June 10 in the process.
 

 

 

 
As can be seen from the chart, Saturday’s surge saw dogecoin collide with a key resistance level at $0.07000, before dropping lower.
 

 
DOGE is now trading at $0.06835, with the RSI hovering around the 56.00 mark, which is marginally above a ceiling at 55.00.
 

 
A target of $0.0750 likely remains on the agenda for bulls, however they face some challenges this weekend in order to reach this point.

Celsius, a company that declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022, acknowledging its substantial debt of up to $10 billion, temporarily halted withdrawals just prior to the bankruptcy filing. 
 
Since then, Celsius has been actively collaborating with regulatory authorities to facilitate the repayment of funds to its debtors. 
 
Now, with the court’s decision, individuals who are owed money can initiate the process of converting their altcoins into Bitcoin and Ether, providing them with an opportunity to retrieve their assets.
