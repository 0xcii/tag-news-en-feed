Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Has Witnessed A Large Positive Spike
 
As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the BTC Coinbase Premium Index has registered a high value recently. The “Coinbase Premium Index” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the percentage difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).
 
When the value of this metric is positive, it means the price of the cryptocurrency listed on Coinbase is greater than on Binance right now. Such a trend implies the presence of a higher buying pressure (or just a lower selling pressure) on the former exchange than the latter one.

While a staggering three-fifths (60%) of Germans surveyed admitted to having never encountered information about the digital euro, half (50%) expressed a willingness to potentially use it if offered as an additional payment option. This openness, despite a lack of familiarity, suggests a public appetite for innovation in the payments landscape.
