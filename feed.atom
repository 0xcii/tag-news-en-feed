        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After trading hours on Wednesday, Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States have exceeded expectations despite a dramatic market weakness earlier this week by producing a notable $98 million influx. For these ETFs, this was the second day in a run of net inflows, highlighting their high use case in the face of market volatility.
 
 
With around $109.9 million, BlackRock’s ETHA topped the inflow and brought its overall holding near to $900 million. Among other noteworthy inflows were Grayscale’s Mini trust with $4.7 million and Fidelity’s FETH with $22.5 million. By comparison, Grayscale’s ETHE went through a $39.7 million outflow in the same frame, figures from Farside Investors UK show.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin has officially signed a law that legalizes cryptocurrency mining in Russia. According to a report by Russian news agency TASS, the law introduces several key concepts, including digital currency mining, mining pools, and mining infrastructure operators. Mining activities are now recognized by Russia as part of turnover rather than the issuance of digital currency.
The new legislation specifies that only Russian legal entities and individual entrepreneurs registered with the government will be allowed to engage in cryptocurrency mining. However, individual miners can participate without registration, provided their energy consumption remains within government-set limits.
Additionally, the law permits the trading of foreign digital financial assets on Russian blockchain platforms. However, the Bank of Russia retains the authority to ban the placement of certain assets if they are deemed a threat to the country’s financial stability.
According to TASS, during a recent government meeting, President Putin emphasized Russia needs "to seize the moment" in establishing a legal framework for digital currencies. He highlighted the potential of digital currencies to contribute to Russia's economic development, stressing the need for proper regulation and infrastructure.
The law is set to take effect ten days after its official publication, except for specific provisions that may have different implementation dates.]]></summary>

Trump’s Plan For National Bitcoin Reserve Faces Backlash 
 
At the Bitcoin 2024 conference on July 27, Trump announced his intention to create a centralized repository for all Bitcoin held or acquired by the US government, which he envisions as a long-term national asset for the benefit of all Americans.
 
This proposal, however, has raised red flags among former prosecutors and legal professionals, who argue that Trump’s plan could potentially divert seized digital assets away from their intended purpose of compensating victims of crime.
