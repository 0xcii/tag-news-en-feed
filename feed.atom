        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-hashrate-records-new-ath-surpassing-740-eh-s"/>
        <updated>2024-09-03T12:11:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin network hash rate reached a new all-time high on September 3rd, surpassing 740 exahashes per second (EH/s). This comes even as Bitcoin prices trade below $60,000.
  
                    
  
                          
                    
  
                      
                
A higher hash rate reflects more computational resources spent processing transactions and mining new Bitcoin. This is despite Bitcoin sliding over 10% this week, which highlights the disconnect between network fundamentals and short-term pricing.
Leading mining companies such as Whatsminer and MicroBT are launching advanced machines to take advantage of the surge in hash rate. Whatsminer has introduced four new mining rigs and a forthcoming solar-powered mining container system. Meanwhile, MicroBT has rolled out its M6XS+ miners, capable of processing between 190 and 450 terahash.
Riot Platforms also purchased Block Mining for $92.5 million to enhance its hash rate and broaden its market presence. Additionally, miners are looking into AI integration and potential acquisition opportunities to address persistent identity challenges in the industry.
Bitcoin's rising hash rate indicates strong confidence in its long-term sustainability. With significant advancements in mining technology and supportive political conditions enhancing profits, miners are rapidly expanding their infrastructure to handle transactions and secure the Bitcoin network.
While the hash rate doesn't directly influence Bitcoin's price, it reinforces the underlying network security. Hashrate milestones also tend to precede bullish market moves and Bitcoin's halving events.]]></summary>

Five justices have rendered their judgment unanimously in relation to Musk refusing to comply with laws in the land – more specifically, the need to appoint a legal representative in Brazil.
 
This ban does not only affect Musk’s operations but also most seriously calls into question free speech and the roles of foreign entities in local jurisdictions.

Alderoty, has criticized the United States Securities and Exchange Commission

Ripple Lawyer Slams SEC
The criticism follows a recent SEC filing  
on August 30. In the filing, the SEC warned that it might challenge any  
proposal by the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX to use stablecoins to repay  
creditors. The SEC noted that FTX’s portfolio includes “crypto asset
