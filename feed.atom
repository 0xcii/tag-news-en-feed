        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin, the popular meme-based cryptocurrency, has once again captured public attention in recent days despite the bearish trend gripping the broader crypto market. DOGE experienced a brief surge following a cryptic post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk last week, which appeared to allude to the token, albeit in an indirect way.
 
Despite this temporary rally, the underlying market sentiment toward Dogecoin remains largely unchanged. The reaction to Musk’s post has not been enough to inspire lasting optimism, particularly among major investors. In fact, large holders have been offloading their positions at a noticeable rate alongside an increase of DOGE inflows to cryptocurrency exchanges.

The Current Trend In Short And Long-Term Holders
 
Short-term holders have seen a significant decline in their net positions over the past two weeks, according to the CryptoQuant analyst.

However, a crypto analyst is offering a glimmer of hope, encouraging investors to remain patient despite the market downtrend, as the next few months could present a bullish turnaround for Bitcoin. 
 
A Ray Of Hope For Crypto Investors
 
As said by many crypto analysts, the month of September is historically a difficult period for Bitcoin, characterized by severe downward momentum, volatility and instability. Rekt Capital, a crypto analyst, told his over 500,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin’s price has plummeted by approximately 8% this September.
