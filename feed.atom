Coinbase To Assist SEC With Cybersecurity
 
On Tuesday, January 9, the cryptocurrency market was shaken up by an unexpected post from the official X (formerly Twitter) account of the US regulator. The post claimed that the agency had approved all Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).
 
However, the regulatory watchdog later announced that the SEC’s X account had experienced a hack. This ultimately allowed the hackers to share false information on the approval of Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock and Ark Investment Management's recent  
move to slash fees for their planned spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  
BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has lowered its fee from 0.30% to 0.25%,  
while Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF reduced its fee to 0.21% from the initial 0.25%.
BlackRock and Ark submitted the revised filings to  
the regulator shortly after a false message briefly appeared on the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC)  
social media account, falsely asserting the approval of the long-awaited ETF.
Despite this, most issuers remain optimistic about  
the SEC's potential approval by Wednesday afternoon, anticipating trading  
commencement as early as Thursday morning, Reuters reported.
