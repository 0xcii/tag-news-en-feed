The SEC had alleged that Ripple had raised over $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP to investors, which should be classified as securities.¬†
 
However, the court noted that programmatic XRP sales did not constitute investment contracts, as they lacked the economic reality of institutional sales, which cut in favor of finding ‚Äúa reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.‚Äù

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon jumped to a five-week high on Thursday, as founders of the token proposed an upgrade that will create a new coin, POL. If approved, MATIC will be replaced with the new token that will function on all Polygon networks. Litecoin also rallied, hitting a one-month high.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) jumped to a multi-week high on Thursday, as traders reacted to the news that some of the project‚Äôs founders have proposed replacing the network‚Äôs MATIC token.
 
If successful, POL will be the new official token of Polygon, and this news has been boosting the price of MATIC/USD to a peak of $0.7668 today.
 
As a result of this, MATIC moved to its highest point since June 9, when price reached a high at $0.7890.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge in price came after the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 60.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 62.34, with the next visible point of resistance at the 70.00 level.
 
In the event this ceiling is hit, MATIC will likely be trading above $0.8000.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) also surged higher in today‚Äôs session, as traders pushed price above the $100.00 mark.
 
Following a low of $94.79 on Wednesday, LTC/USD raced to an intraday peak at $101.45 earlier in the day.
 
Overall, this is the strongest level the token has hit since last Thursday, when it peaked at $105.95.
 
 
The jump comes after bulls rebounded following a breakout below a support point at $95.00, with the RSI hitting a floor of its own at 53.00.
 
Currently, price strength is at a reading of 57.88, with LTC continuing to record higher highs as the day progresses.
 
A ceiling of $102.00 is now the obvious target, and should the price push past this point, there is a good chance LTC hits $105.00 in the coming days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that stablecoin sharks and whales have been strongly accumulating recently, something that could be positive for Bitcoin.
 
Sharks & Whales Of Stablecoins Like DAI & USDP Are Accumulating
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, large holders of some stablecoins have been expanding their holdings recently. The relevant indicator here is the ‚ÄúSupply Distribution,‚Äù which measures what percentage of the total supply of an asset (in this case, a stablecoin) is being held by which wallet groups in the market.
 
The addresses are divided into these wallet groups based on the total number of coins that they are currently carrying in their balances. The 1-10 coins cohort, for instance, includes all addresses holding between 1 and 10 tokens of the asset.

recover $323 million paid to the leadership of FTX Europe, a subsidiary of the

According to a court

FTX CEO and the FTX Group, allegedly paid the money for the acquisition of  
DAAG, a Swiss company that was later renamed FTX Europe.
According to the

The announcement, made through a blog post, introduces POL as a next-generation protocol token that aims to become a major driving force for the coordination and growth of the ecosystem, positioning it as the Value Layer of the Internet.
 
Polygon: MATIC Becomes POL
 
The proposal, outlined in a comprehensive white paper by a group of Polygon founders and researchers, introduces POL as a third-generation native asset, characterized as a hyperproductive token. According to them, POL enhances the functionality of native tokens by allowing validators to validate multiple chains and enabling each chain to offer multiple roles and corresponding rewards to validators.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin retreated from recent gains on Thursday, as traders were unable to sustain a breakout of a key resistance level. Market volatility has risen following yesterday‚Äôs U.S. inflation report, which dropped to a two-year low. Ethereum was marginally lower, slipping below $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated below the $31,000 level in today‚Äôs session, as traders continued to digest the latest inflation report.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $30,228.84 earlier in today‚Äôs session, a day after peaking at $30,959.97.
 
The drop came as bulls were unable to sustain a breakout above a key resistance level at the $30,800 zone.
 
 
From the chart, this coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failing to break out of its own ceiling at 61.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 59.30, with a floor of 55.00 a possible target should momentum continue to slip.
 
Should this occur, there is a good chance that bitcoin will move below $30,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
After a brief stint above $1,900, ethereum (ETH) also moved lower on Thursday, with a moving average crossover close to occurring.
 
Following a high of $1,901.15 on Wednesday, ETH/USD fell to a bottom at $1,864.50 earlier in today‚Äôs session.
 
Similar to BTC, this drop came as ethereum fell below a recent resistance level of $1,890, and towards a floor at $1,850.
 
 
One of the reasons for this was due to the RSI failing to move past a ceiling at 53.00. It is currently hovering at 52.56.
 
Overall, momentum seems to be bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average likely to race past the 25-day (blue) trend line momentarily.
 
In the event this takes place, bears could target exits at $1,795.
