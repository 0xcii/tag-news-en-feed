        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the January 10 deadline for the approval of the much-anticipated spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) draws near, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly grappling with an overwhelming amount of paperwork. An approval by the end of today seems rather unlikely, although the latest surge in the Bitcoin price shows that market participants are of a different opinion.
 
Eleanor Terrett, a journalist for FOX Business, shared insights on the situation via X (formerly known as Twitter), noting the unpredictable nature of the SEC’s decision-making process. She remarked, “While the SEC is surely unpredictable, it would surprise me if approvals were to happen tomorrow.”

There are many ways the investors can be grouped based on on-chain data, with one popular method being through holding time. The Bitcoin market is broadly divided into two cohorts using this criteria: the “short-term holders” and “long-term holders.”
 
The cutoff of 155 days is used for separating the two groups. Any address holding its coins for less than this period is put inside the STH cohort, while the rest of …]]></summary>

23-Year-Old Russian Bitcoin Miner Kidnapped for Ransom
 
On Dec. 25, in a rapid sequence of events, it was reported that the crypto miner was kidnapped and subjected to coercion. The ordeal began when he was abruptly seized from his dwelling and shoved into a Niva car, a model noted for its durability on Russian terrain. Ren TV disclosed that the kidnappers, including one acquainted with the victim, warned of grave repercussions unless the 15 million rubles ($166,000) ransom was promptly delivered.
 
The captors swiftly relayed their ransom demands via the Telegram messaging app, reaching out directly to the victim’s brother. They leveraged threats of fabricated criminal charges to hasten the payment, stating their intent to frame the victim as a drug smuggler by planting narcotics on him and then alerting the police.
 
The culprits, identified as individuals with a history of robbery and extortion, are currently facing severe legal consequences. The gravity of the charges mirrors the Russian judiciary’s approach to this type of abduction scenario. The report indicates that the perpetrators could be sentenced to as much as 12 years of incarceration for their actions.
 
 
Regrettably, since 2014, over 100 physical assaults have targeted crypto holders. Initially, these incidents were sparse, but as the value of crypto assets soared, so did the frequency of violent acts against their owners. These attacks encompass methods like kidnappings, assaults, and home invasions. In Nov. 2023, Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, commonly referred to as CZ, revealed that criminals had kidnapped a Binance client, coercing them to drain their crypto wallets.
