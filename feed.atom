Ethereum Exchange Deposits Have Spiked Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst on Twitter, there are signs of increased short-term selling pressure in the ETH market at the moment. The relevant indicator here is the “Ethereum active deposits,” which measures the daily total number of exchange addresses that are taking part in some deposit activity currently.
 
This indicator only keeps track of the unique number of such addresses, meaning that it only counts an address once even if it has been involved in multiple deposit transactions in a single day.
 
The advantage of this limitation is that unique addresses are analogous to unique users on the network, so …]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/average-bitcoin-transaction-fees-skyrocket-to-19-20-per-transfer-as-over-440000-transactions-remain-unconfirmed/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-08T14:46:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin transaction fees have surged significantly in the past 24 hours, with the average fee reaching $19.20 per transfer. The increase in fees can be linked to a backlog of transactions trapped in the mempool, as over 440,000 unconfirmed transactions are currently awaiting confirmation.
 
Block Reward Dethroned: Bitcoin Transaction Fees Surpass Mining Subsidy for the First Time Since 2017
 
On Sunday, May 7, 2023, bitcoin transaction fees exceeded the block reward for the first time since December 2017 at block height 788,695. Subsequent block heights 788,700 and 788,702 also witnessed fees surpassing the subsidy.
 
At present, over 440,000 bitcoin transactions are pending confirmation with 193 blocks left to mine for clearing them all. Fees soared past the $25 mark per transaction on Sunday, and current data displays an average fee of 0.00069 BTC or $19.20 per transaction.
 
According to bitinfocharts.com data, the median-sized fee is 0.0004 BTC or $11.05 per transfer. High-priority transactions are paying upwards of $22.90 per transaction and individuals are paying $19.95 for medium-priority transactions.
 
Block intervals or mining times have been exceeding the ten-minute average lately. The most recent block time was approximately ten minutes and 34 seconds. Slower block times may result in another decline in difficulty — an estimated drop of around 5.3% is anticipated to occur on May 18, 2023.
 
 
The average hashrate over the past 2,016 blocks is roughly 338 exahash per second (EH/s). The network’s hashrate has dipped below the 300 EH/s range on some instances and is presently running at 385 EH/s at the time of writing.
 
What impact do you think the surge in bitcoin transaction fees and the backlog of unconfirmed transactions will have on the future of cryptocurrency adoption and scalability? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.]]></summary>

Faster and affordable transactions
The potential  
for speed and cost savings over more conventional ways makes adopting  
cryptocurrencies in real estate transactions one of their main advantages. Real  
estate transactions can take weeks or even months to complete using  
conventional procedures. Transactions involving cryptocurrency can be finished

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recent shift of meme coins to the BRC-20 standard has changed Bitcoin’s network fees. More emerging meme coins flock to BTC’s BRC-20 standard as more coins emerge. 
 
Notably, the hype and frenzy about meme coins spiked due to the impressive performance of Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Wojak (WOJAK). The influx of these projects has congested the BTC network. As a result, BTC’s transaction fees surged to a multi-year peak.  
 
BRC-20 Tokens Fees Hit Multi-Year High
 
With the growing hype around meme coins, the activities surrounding the tokens within the Bitcoin network keep rising. According to the crypto data analytics platform Dune Analytics, the daily minting fees on BRC-20 hit a record high of 247 BTC on May 7. The value shows that the fees reached their highest level in two years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Jonathan Buck, founder of JB & GS Mining GmbH, a German bitcoin mining hosting company.
Argentina is currently in the midst of a crippling inflation crisis, with the national currency, the Argentine peso (ARS), losing value at an alarming rate. Just one year ago, the exchange rate from the U.S. dollar to the ARS was 115.75, and at the time of this writing, it stands at 224.52. Reports indicate that on the black market, people are paying more than double this rate. The country's annual inflation rate has skyrocketed to a staggering 104%, presenting significant challenges to both its economy and citizens. In response, the country’s central bank has raised interest rates to an astounding 81%.
As the peso's value continues to nosedive, Argentinians urgently need…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-05-08T13:15:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below $28,000 to start the week, as markets continued to react to last Friday’s United States nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report. The payrolls report came in at 250,000 versus expectations of 180,000 jobs. Ethereum was also lower, as prices fell back below $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved lower to start the week, as cryptocurrency markets continued to react to the latest nonfarm payrolls report.
 
The number of jobs added to the U.S. economy came in higher than expected, in many’s eyes justifying the Federal Reserve’s decision to hike interest rates by 0.25%.
 
As a result, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $27,691.26 earlier in today’s session, following a peak of $29,119.38 the day prior.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, BTC has now fallen for a third straight session, with this latest drop sending prices to a one-week low.
 
One of the catalysts for the decline was a breakout which took place on the relative strength index (RSI), which fell below a floor at 47.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.32, with a floor of 42.00 a potential target for bears.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also in the red on Monday, with prices plunging below $1,900.
 
Following a high of $1,934.00 on Sunday, ETH/USD dropped by almost $100, hitting a low of $1,839.89 earlier in the day.
 
Similar to bitcoin, today’s decline saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency fall for its third consecutive day.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that ethereum bears are now attempting to take the RSI to its own point of support at 45.00.
 
Currently, the index is at the 47.02 level, having recently moved below a higher support point at 49.00.
 
Should price strength hit the target of 45.00, there is a possibility that ETH will be trading under $1,800.

Investors Await CPI Data Release
 
The latest iteration of the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) is scheduled to be released later this week and crypto investors seem to be waiting for this before taking any action. The release will happen on May 10, 2023, and will show if inflation in the country increased, decreased, or stayed the same, which can have a great impact on financial markets.
 
 
If inflation were to come in higher, the Fed could retake a hawkish stance which would be brutal for risk assets such as Bitcoin. However, if…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spanish law enforcement recently nabbed three individuals who befriended and eventually kidnapped a Syrian cryptocurrency dealer. Following their arrest, the kidnappers, who were demanding a ransom of over $1.1 million, were found in possession of weapons and fake identity documents. 
 
Syrian Crypto Dealer’s Captors Were His Party Friends
 
Spanish law enforcement recently freed a Syrian cryptocurrency dealer from three kidnappers that were demanding a ransom of $1.12 million (or €1 million). According to a report by a Spanish-language publication, the captured trio was set to appear in court on May 6 where they were expected to face kidnapping as well as illegal possession of weapons charges.
 
As revealed in the report, the unnamed Syrian crypto dealer had partied with the trio before the kidnapping. However, when they four met on May 3, the Hungary-based crypto dealer’s party friends pounced and started demanding the ransom money. According to the report, the crypto dealer whose company is based in Dubai, was told to access applications that he uses to manage his crypto business and to contact the intended recipient of the ransom money.
 
 
However, whilst in captivity, the Syrian crypto dealer is said to have taken a picture through the window and sent this over to a colleague who was negotiating his release. The colleague, in turn, then sent this to the victim’s other acquaintance who then forwarded this to law enforcement.
 
Upon receiving the information, Spanish law enforcement launched an investigation which eventually led to the raid on a luxury villa located in Benalmádena. In addition to finding weapons and gardening tools, law enforcement agents also found one of the kidnappers in possession of several fake identity documents. In addition, two of the Syrian crypto dealer’s captors had fake Greek Passports.
