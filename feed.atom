The temporary pause in withdrawals comes as the decentralized finance (DeFi) buzzes with activity. DeFiLlama data reveals a remarkable surge in Solana’s total value locked, skyrocketing to $2.6 billion from $1.65 billion just a month ago.
 
 
Binance’s decision, born out of necessity, comes as transaction volumes on the Solana network reached unprecedented heights, causing operational hiccups that demand immediate attention. Bi…]]></summary>

The Cardano founder’s post is significant, considering that ADA and DOGE are going head-to-head, with both tokens presently ranking as the 8th and 9th largest tokens by market cap.
