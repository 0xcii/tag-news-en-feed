        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Terra community isn’t relenting in its efforts to revive the LUNC and USTC tokens and take them back to their old glory days. This time, the community has proposed a proposal to ensure that the Luna Classic’s (LUNC) circulating supply data is well documented. 
 
Terra Community Proposes All Allnodes As An Official Organization
 
The text proposal titled ‘Change official CS API endpoint to Allnodes FCD’ aims to make Allnodes an official organization of the Terra community. Allnodes will be responsible for “hosting the endpoint, providing the correct circulating supply data for Luna Classic.” The proposal also aims to get an agreement from community members about how this circulating supply should be calculated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After five weeks of fleeing the digital asset market, investors are cautiously dipping their toes back in, with Bitcoin (BTC) emerging as the clear favorite. A recent report by CoinShares reveals a net inflow of $130 million into crypto investment products, marking a potential turning point after a period of sustained outflows.
 
 
US Investors Lead The Charge
 
The United States emerged as the primary driver of this shift, contributing the lion’s share of the inflows. This trend can be attributed, at least partially, to a slowdown in selling pressure from Grayscale, the world’s largest digital currency asset manager. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) witnessed its lowest weekly withdrawals in five months, further bolstering investor confidence.
