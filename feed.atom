The price is retracing at the moment, and there are possibilities that it could still move downward. At this point, it could be that BTC’s price is losing steam and headed for a downward shift.
 
At the time of writing, the price of BTC was up by 0.9%, trading around $67,734 below the 4-hour 100-day moving average in the last 24 hours. However, in the daily timeframe, the price is still trading above the 100-day moving average.
 
Bitcoin On The 4-hour Chart
 
Looking at the 4-hour timeframe chart, Bitcoin is already trading below the 100-day moving average and trying to break below the trend line. The price could start a new trend downward if it manages to break below the trend line.

Bitcoin is often compared to the internet in the 1990s, but I believe the better analogy is to the telegraph in the 1840s.[1]
The telegraph was the first technology to transmit encoded data at near-light speed over long distances. It marked the birth of the telecommunications industry. The internet, though it is bigger in scale, richer in content, and manyto-many instead of one-to-one, …]]></summary>

The price of Bitcoin, which has been mostly moving sideways over the past few days, fell below the $67,000 mark for the first time in more than a week.
 
As a result of the abrupt decline, the crypto market has witnessed nearly $900 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours. According to Futures market data from Coinglass, losses from leveraged Bitcoin and Ether positions are responsible for the larger chunk of the liquidations.
 
On-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed the driving factor behind the latest decline in the Bitcoin price and the general crypto market downturn.
