        <updated>2023-05-12T16:18:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu moved close to a five-month low on Friday, as meme coins reacted to news that Elon Musk has found a new Twitter CEO. Musk tweeted, “Excited to announce that I’ve hired a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks.” Dogecoin neared a two-month low today.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) neared a five-month low on Friday, as markets reacted to the news that Elon Musk will be stepping down as CEO.
 
Musk, who acquired the social media company last year, has been at the helm since the takeover, but has now found a long-term replacement.
 
Following a high of $0.000008746 on Thursday, SHIB/USD dropped to a bottom of $0.000008549 earlier in the day.
 
 
As a result of this sell-off, shiba inu moved close to Monday’s low at $0.00000835, which was the weakest point the meme coin has hit since January.
 
Looking at the chart, this latest move occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) moved deep into oversold territory, with a current reading at 23.02.
 
This does give hope to longer-term bulls however, that a reversal could be on the cards.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) also moved lower in today’s session, as the meme coin neared a multi-month low of its own.
 
DOGE/USD fell to an intraday low of $0.06957 earlier on Friday, hours after trading at a peak of $0.07268.
 
Similar to SHIB, today’s decline almost led to dogecoin recapturing a low of $0.0692, which was its weakest level since March.
 
 
DOGE has since bounced back from this earlier low, after bulls rejected a full breakout of a support point of $0.07000.
 
As of writing, the price is now at $0.07127, which seems to have occurred as traders moved to buy the dip.
 
Should today’s low be the hard floor, there will likely be a stronger rebound in the coming days.

Ethereum Network Experiences Temporary Transaction Processing Issue
 
The Ethereum blockchain was unable to process ETH transactions and reach consensus for approximately 25 minutes on Thursday, just after 4 p.m. (ET). Ansgar Dietrichs, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation said: “The beacon chain had a brief period of non-finalization just now. Good illustration for the robustness of the chain — while there was some slowdown of blocks, transactions continued to be processed as usual. We are back to normal now.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell to a seven-week low on May 12, as prices dropped below the $27,000 level in today’s session. Friday’s decline came as a red wave swept through cryptocurrencies, with the market cap down 2.75% as of writing. Ethereum also slipped to its weakest point since March. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $27,000 level in today’s session, pushing prices to a seven-week low.
 
Following a high of $27,589.92 on Thursday, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday bottom at $26,166.87.
 
As a result of this drop, bitcoin fell to its lowest level since March 17, when price was below the $25,000 mark.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, this latest sell-off coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) breaking out of yesterday’s floor of 43.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 35.07, which is its lowest point in over two months.
 
Should momentum continue in this current trajectory, there is a possibility that BTC could move toward $25,000 this weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also in the red on Friday, as bears continued to control market sentiment.
 
ETH/USD slipped to a low at $1,742.40 on Thursday, following an earlier peak of $1,835.62 the day prior.
 
Similar to bitcoin, today’s drop in price saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency hit its lowest point since March.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
A major catalyst to the move was also a breakout on the RSI, which fell out of a support point at the 44.00 zone.
 
Currently, the index is at a reading of 39.04, which is its weakest level since March 11, when ETH traded below $1,500.
 
Ultimately, this could be a long-term positive for bulls, who may move to buy the current dip in price.
