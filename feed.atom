        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent legal development, New York Attorney General Letitia James has successfully obtained over $22 million from Kucoin, a well known crypto trading platform. This settlement arises from Kucoin’s alleged failure to register as a securities and commodities broker-dealer and its misrepresentation as a crypto exchange. 
 
New York AG Clinches Settlement From Kucoin Over Registration Lapses
 
On Tuesday, the consent order applied by James mandates that Kucoin refund over 150,000 New York investors more than $16.7 million and pay an additional $5.3 million to the state. Attorney General James emphasized the reported risks associated with unregistered offshore crypto platforms to investors, consumers, and the broader economy.

        <updated>2023-12-12T19:19:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KuCoin has agreed to a settlement worth USD $22  
million with the state of New York, and to halt services for users in the region,  
according to an order filed in the Supreme Court today (Tuesday). The crypto  
exchange was charged for offering, selling, and purchasing cryptocurrencies as  
securities and commodities, breaching New York's laws. 
KuCoin has acknowledged the allegations, agreeing to  
a payment of $5.3 million and specific obligations. These include terminating  
access to its services for New York users within a stipulated timeframe,  
ceasing account creation for NY residents, and restricting existing NY accounts  
solely for withdrawal purposes.
Additionally, the exchange has committed to  
returning current account balances held by New York customers, valued at  
approximately $16.7 million in fiat and cryptocurrencies. This restitution  
process involves facilitating withdrawals and transferring remaining balances  
to a third-party fund administrator for subsequent return to affected New York  
customers.
KuCoin's compliance  
with the agreement involves a commitment to cease operations for New York  
users, ensuring strict adherence to the consent order's terms and conditions.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon (MATIC) has been on the lower performance end when compared to other cryptocurrencies in the space. However, this muted performance could be a precursor to a bullish momentum outside of the general market recovery, something that has become a norm for the MATIC price. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified Polygon’s potential in this aspect, expecting the price to rise as high as $1.82 once a major level is breached.
 
Polygon Gearing Up For Bullish Breakout
 
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez points out that the Polygon price is looking toward breaking a significant resistance. Mainly, such a breakout would be the catalyst for the expected price surge which could trigger a 100% price increase.

Inscriptions work by embedding images or other data into the bitcoin blockchain by using a trick in bitcoin script. They essentially put the data in an unreachable code block followed by the real spending conditions so the user can claim the ordinal/NFT. It is quite an ingenious trick but has broke a lot of the assumptions many bitcoiners were operating under.
