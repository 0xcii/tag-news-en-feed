The bill, formally introduced in Parliament on September 11, aims to redefine the legal status of these digital assets and provide greater protection and clarity for investors and the broader crypto market after years of regulatory uncertainty in the European region.
 
Bitcoin And NFTs Protected Under New British Law
 
The Property Bill, as highlighted in the government’s press release, marks a significant shift in the legal landscape by officially recognizing digital holdings and even carbon credits as personal property under British laws.
