        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anthony Scaramucci, founder of major investment firm Skybridge Capital, predicted a Bitcoin price target of $170,000 in the current cycle during an appearance on CNBC's Closing Bell.

NEW: Skybridge’s Anthony Scaramucci says #Bitcoin halving is still not priced in.
Predicts “$170000 for this cycle.” 🚀 pic.twitter.com/0uE4EAmwgS
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 8, 2024
  
  
  
Scaramucci has been a vocal Bitcoin proponent, with Skybridge investing heavily in Bitcoin. He cited increasing mainstream and institutional adoption as key drivers of Bitcoin's growth.
The prominent financier and former White House Communications Director highlighted the major impact of SEC-approved Bitcoin spot ETFs in unlocking billions in new investments this year. He compared the over $10 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows in Q1 favourably to the slower adoption of early gold ETFs.
Scaramucci also discussed the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will reduce daily supply and potentially dramatically impact prices. He believes the market has not priced in the halving, predicting a supply squeeze.
Although volatile, Scaramucci stressed Bitcoin's inflation-hedging ability over a 4-year investment horizon, touting its digital gold narrative. He sees potential for Bitcoin's market cap to reach 50% of gold's valuation.
Scaramucci has been an avid Bitcoin proponent, with Skybridge taking an early institutional interest in Bitcoin. The firm led a high-profile push to offer Bitcoin exposure in 401(k) retirement plans, underscoring its commitment.
Despite some mainstream scepticism over the years, Scaramucci has maintained a bullish long-term outlook on Bitcoin as an emerging digital store of value. He cites generational wealth transfers and Bitcoin-friendly demographics as setting the stage for massive growth.
Scaramucci also touched on the FTX collapse, its impact, regulatory issues, and his optimism regarding the Bitcoin industry's future maturation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is a decentralized and finite digital currency, it’s verifiable by anyone anywhere in the world. This is the chief reason people have any interest in holding it at all. No one can dilute the supply, no one can counterfeit Bitcoin, it just works as an autonomous system that cannot be interfered with. So how do you participate in this system fully to verify everything?
If you think that simply using a Bitcoin wallet is enough to do so, I’m sorry to tell you that in reality that does not make you a full participant in the Bitcoin network. A wallet simply manages your private keys and helps you craft and sign your transactions, it does not actually participate in the full validation of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin Halving And Its Influence On Floor Prices Of Mining Machines
 
The halving is a periodic event on the Bitcoin network where the block rewards received by the miners for successfully solving a block are permanently cut in half. This event automatically goes through every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years.
 
The reason the halving exists is that the block rewards serve as the only way to introduce new BTC tokens into circulation, so by periodically slashing them in half, the cryptocurrency’s production rate can be diminished, and thus, its inflation can be controlled.
 
 
Supply-demand dynamics dictate that the rarer is an …]]></summary>

This price action suggests that the bears are still in control, which could remain the case throughout this week. As the tug of war continues, here are some key events to watch out for. 
 
Is The Pre-Halving Retrace Over?
 
Crypto analyst Rekt Capital previously highlighted the phases of the Bitcoin Halving, including the pre-halving retrace. He noted that Bitcoin’s price usually drops 28 to 14 days before the Halving event. With the halving event about 12 days away, there is the belief that the pre-halving retrace is over. 
 
 
However, considering that the cycle has already proven unique, especially with BTC hitting a new all-time high (ATH) before the Halving, investors will und…]]></summary>
