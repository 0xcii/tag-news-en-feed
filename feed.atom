The total supply is not specifically defined in the code, but is instead derived from the code’s issuance schedule, which is reduced by half every 210,000 blocks or roughly every four years. This reduction event is called the bitcoin halving (or “halvening” in some circles).

The first thing a professional ad copywriter will identify is the prospect’s main conscious and unconscious “objections” and fears. In other words, whatever is most likely standing in the way of this person being converted.
Let’s therefore start with the main orange-pilling obstacles, before a solution is presented.
