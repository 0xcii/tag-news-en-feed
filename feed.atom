Citing Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling, the lawyer provided insight into how Ripple can make these sales without first registering these tokens with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
Ripple Has The Right To Sell Their XRP Holdings
 
Morgan stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “nothing prevents Ripple” from selling its XRP tokens. He highlighted how anyone, including the crypto firm, can sell assets that they own. However, he believes the issue is not whether or not Ripple can sell these tokens but the manner in which they have to go about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, bitcoin experienced a decline, reaching a low of $40,600, and has since been hovering slightly above the $41,000 mark. The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with speculation about the duration of this downturn, especially as the excitement surrounding the spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) begins to wane.
 
Bitcoin
 
The bitcoin daily chart as of Jan. 19, 2024, depicts a predominantly downward trajectory. This shift from a peak near $49,048 to a more recent low close to $36,727 marks notable market volatility. The chart reflects a series of rises and falls, pointing to a market fraught with uncertainty. Although there has been a recent uptick, suggesting a slight recovery, it’s too early to determine if this is just a brief respite or the start of a significant market shift.
