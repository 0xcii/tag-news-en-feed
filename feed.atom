        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strica, the software powerhouse behind Cardano-centric tools such as Cardanoscan.io, Typhon Wallet, and Flac Finance, has introduced Warp Transactions. This innovation promises to revolutionize the way ADA token transfers are conducted on the Cardano network.
 
The crux of the issue lies in Cardano’s inherent requirement for a minimum of approximately 1.14 ADA to accompany any token transfer. This mechanism, while designed to shield the network from potential threats and spam, has been a point of contention for users. The necessity to attach this minimum ADA when sending tokens has been seen as cumbersome. Warp Transactions, as integrated into the Typhon Wallet, offers a solution to this predicament.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to insiders who reached out to Bloomberg, there are intriguing developments surrounding Ryan Salame, the former co-chief executive of FTX Digital Markets. The buzz is that he is gearing up to admit guilt in response to criminal charges. This marks a significant shift from his earlier stance, which was revealed in mid-August when he appeared poised to invoke the Fifth Amendment, thereby rendering himself unavailable as a potential witness.
 
Ryan Salame’s Dramatic Turn: From Invoking the Fifth to Pondering Guilty Plea
 
The current narrative presents a contrasting perspective, hinting at the potential formation of a plea agreement concerning Ryan Salame, the former co-chief of FTX. Citing “people familiar with the case,” Bloomberg reports that Salame is poised to enter a guilty plea in connection with the FTX collapse.
 
Bloomberg’s Ava Benny-Morrison delivered this report on September 7, 2023, diverging from the accounts of the previous month. During that period, court documents from the prosecution’s case against ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) had indicated that Salame had expressed his intention to invoke the Fifth Amendment if subpoenaed, rendering him “unavailable as a witness.”
 
 
Should Salame indeed plead guilty, he will become the fourth individual to do so, joining Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh. SBF, on the other hand, has pleaded not guilty to all the criminal charges against him and is presently incarcerated, awaiting trial at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The trial is scheduled for October, and SBF’s legal team is actively seeking his release from custody to prepare for the upcoming proceedings.

Bitcoin Transaction Fees Has Been Trending Up With Each Cycle
 
One of the most innovative features of the Bitcoin blockchain is that approximately every four years, the block subsidy (that miners receive for solving blocks on the network) is slashed in half. Such events are called the “halving.”
 
Halvings naturally mean that the miners’ revenues also take a heavy hit, primarily made up of the block rewards. Why does the concept of halving even exist? Well, consider the scenario if there was no halving.
 
The block rewards serve as the only way to mint new tokens so that they can be equated to the new production of the asset. Without halvings, miners…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former FTX’s Executive Ryan Salame prepares to plead  
guilty to criminal charges to the cryptocurrency exchange’s collapse. This turn  
of events comes after extended negotiations with the prosecutors. The executive  
is scheduled to appear in a Manhattan federal court today (Thursday) for the  
guilty plea, according to the people familiar with the matter.
Salame served as  
Co-Chief Executive of FTX’s Bahamas subsidiary. His decision to plead guilty  
follows closely behind the impending trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces  
allegations of orchestrating a multi-billion fraud scheme. Prosecutors contend  
that Bankman-Fried misappropriated FTX customer funds for personal  
expenditures, high-risk investments in Alameda Research, and political  
donations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Josef Tětek, a Bitcoin analyst at Trezor.
Self-custody is an absolute must for every bitcoiner. After the collapses of FTX, BlockFi, Celsius and many others, the merit of the “not your keys” mantra is beyond obvious. However, self-custody comes in many forms, and the security properties of a single-seed setup are not that great. That is why advanced bitcoiners should consider upgrading to a Shamir backup.
What is Shamir backup?
Shamir backup is a method for securely splitting a recovery seed while adding an element of redundancy. For example, with Shamir backup it is possible to have a 3-of-5 recovery seed, where the user writes down 5 lists of recovery words, and later needs only 3 of those lists to recover the wallet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin was a big mover on Thursday, as the token rose by nearly 4%, closing in on the $1.90 level in the process. The rally came despite crypto price consolidation, with the global market cap largely unchanged as of writing. Stellar also surged, remaining near a recent two-week high. 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was one of Thursday’s notable gainers, as price rallied by as much as 4% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $1.75 on Wednesday, TON/USD rose to a peak of $1.88, earlier in today’s session.
 
The move comes days after the token reached a high of $2.05, which was the highest point it has hit since May.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rise in price comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped at a floor of 60.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 63.35, with the next point of resistance around 66.00.
 
In the event it moves beyond this level, there is a good chance that price will move back towards $2.00.
 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
Stellar (XLM) also hovered in the green, as the price remained near a resistance level of $0.1300.
 
XLM/USD rose to a peak of $0.1243 earlier in the day, which comes following a low of $0.1178 the day prior.
 
The move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average approaches an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
In addition to this, the RSI is on the cusp of breaking out of a key resistance level of 50.00, which has been held for close to a month.
 
Bulls will potentially aim to penetrate this point in the coming days, taking price near a ceiling of $0.1400.
