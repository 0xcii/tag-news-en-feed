        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the XRP lawsuit, Ripple has filed its opposition to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) motion for remedies and entry of final judgment. The fintech company counters the agency’s for nearly $2 billion in penalties with a proposed fine of just $10 million maximum. Filed late Monday, Ripple’s 186-page opposition document details its arguments against the SEC’s severe demands following a court ruling that found Ripple in violation of securities laws by selling XRP to institutional investors without proper registration.

Janet Yellen’s ‘Buy Bitcoin’ Sign Sparks Auction Frenzy
 
The message, a rallying cry for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, gained notoriety after being displayed behind former Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Janet Yellen during her congressional testimony about seven years ago. Bidding on the ink drawing is expected to close late Wednesday.
 
According to the report, the sign’s improvised creation can be attributed to Christian Langalis, a 22-year-old Bitcoin owner and intern at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute at the time.

Bitcoin 7-Day Average Hashrate Hit New All-Time High Recently
 
Halving is a periodic event for Bitcoin in which its block rewards—that is, the rewards that miners receive for solving blocks on the network—are permanently cut in half.
 
This event takes place roughly every four years, and the latest one was completed just recently. This was the fourth Halving the cryptocurrency has gone through, and its block rewards have now come down to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.
 
 
Bitcoin miners earn their living from two sources: the block rewards and transaction fees. Historically, however, the former has been a much more dominant income stream, as transaction fees h…]]></summary>
