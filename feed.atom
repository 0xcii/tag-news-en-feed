In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock revealed how the Bitcoin whales have been behaving recently, given the struggle the asset’s price has been going through.
 
Whales popularly refer to BTC investors carrying at least 1,000 tokens in their wallets. At the current exchange rate, this amount is worth about $63.5 million. Due to this massive scale of holdings, the whales can influence the network.
 
 
Thus, their behavior can naturally be worth following. First, the analytics firm has discussed the largest entities, even among the whales: the “Large Holders.” Into…]]></summary>

Miners Accumulating Bitcoin
 
In a post on X, one analyst, while citing CryptoQuant data, notes that since the beginning of 2024, the total BTC balance held by miners has grown by a staggering 12,100 BTC, reaching a total of 217,000 BTC. 
 
This behavior starkly contrasts with what happened in 2016 and 2020 before the network slashed miner rewards. Then, reading from data, most miners were sizing down their holdings in anticipation of possible revenue slumps post-Halving.
