The renowned finance author is known to be a huge advocate of digital assets and again made a case for them while making this revelation. 
 
The “Easiest Way” To Become A Millionaire
 
Kiyosaki mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin is the easiest way to become a millionaire. He highlighted how making millions as an entrepreneur can be. The renowned finance author noted that one has to be “really smart, dedicated, and lucky” to become a millionaire while starting their own business. As such, Kiyosaki claims he saves BTC instead because the flagship crypto does the hard work for him, which is why he loves Bitcoin.

“David Bailey just claimed — without any evidence in Dylan LeClair ‘s space with Matthew Pines that central banks are buying Bitcoin,” stated Joe Carlasare, a partner at Amundsen Davis LLC.
