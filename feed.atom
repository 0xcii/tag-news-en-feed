According to Joe Vezzani, CEO of LunarCrush, the purpose of this stunt is to “inspire people to establish networks that will unlock a new era of exploration.”

This is an opinion editorial by James Collins, a financial professional with experience in various asset classes.
“We encourage it, we advance it. But I would say we provide the platform … for those involved in Bitcoin to make sure they have a place to come to.”
The above words spoken by Texas Governor Greg Abbott are a clear reminder of the sheer power hidden within the varying components of Bitcoin that allow the system to organically steer a state or nation into a realm of independence and ethical, fiduciary responsibilities for its citizenry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elon Musk, the self-acclaimed “Dogefather,” has asked a US Judge to dismiss a $258 billion lawsuit filed against him in 2022. The lawsuit accuses Musk of manipulating the price of Dogecoin in a Ponzi-like manner leading investors to lose money on their investments. 
 
Musk denies this and has filed for the court to dismiss the complaint. His lawyers, in the filing, noted that the lawsuit is a ‘’fanciful work of fiction’’ over his innocent and often silly tweets about Dogecoin. They further stated that the plaintiff never explained how Musk intended to defraud anyone with his tweets and that statements like ‘’no highs, no lows, only Doge’’ were insufficient to support fraud claims.
