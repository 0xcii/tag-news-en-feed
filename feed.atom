North Korean State Media on De-Dollarization and the BRICS
 
North Korea’s state media, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), published an article Sunday titled “Expansion of BRICS is an inevitable result of the present unfair international economic order.” The article is authored by Jong Il Hyon, an international affairs analyst of the DPRK.
 
He explained that the primary driving force behind numerous countries joining the BRICS bloc is “the present unfair and unreasonable international economic order” that centers around the U.S.-led internati…]]></summary>

        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e757767180e</id>
        <link href="https://bitcoinist.com/first-half-2023-crypto-countdown-bitcoin-32000/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-27T01:27:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are about four days left to go before the first half of 2023 in crypto comes to a close, and with it the 6M Bitcoin candle.
 
The high timeframe BTCUSD chart is close to forming a potential bullish reversal pattern, but is currently falling short of surpassing the trigger point. Here is a closer look at why Bitcoin has only four days remaining to push above $32,000 and cement a reversal across the crypto market.
 
Watch: Charting The Morning Star Pattern In BTCUSD
 

 
In technical analysis, high timeframe signals are always the most dominant, so what happens in the next few days with Bitcoin is crucial to determining the future trend.
 
The 6M candlestick is about as high timeframe as it gets, making any signals on the chart especially powerful. This is precisely why a possible morning star pattern is especially notable.
 
 
The 18-month long pattern includes the worst of the bear market, the local bottom around November, and all of 2023 thus far. And all of this happens — more than 500 days of price action — in just three candlesticks.
 

 
 
Bitcoin Must Rise Above $32,000 By 6M Candle Close
 
Importantly, Bitcoin is currently finding resistance at $32,000 per coin challenging to crack through. The resistance exists due to it being the 50% retracement point of the previous uptrend. It is also the mid-point of the large black down candle making up one-third of the morning star pattern.
 
 
A morning star pattern is a bullish reversal pattern in Japanese candlestick analysis. Such signals should be taken into context of the broader market, such as if it appears at support or resistance, or during oversold or overbought levels.
 
BTCUSD is still oversold enough on high timeframes, and the pattern formed after sweeping $20,000 resistance turned support. If the pattern confirms and takes out $32,000 at close, Bitcoin could next take a shot at former all-time highs, and possibly exceed them in the next several candles.]]></summary>

JPMorgan’s Global Outlook and ‘Boil the Frog’ Recession
 
Global investment bank JPMorgan has provided an overview of four potential global outlook scenarios that it expects to unfold in 2023 and 2024. The bank’s economists believe that the likelihood of the United States entering a recession outweighs the possibility of avoiding one.
 
The most likely outcome, according to JPMorgan, is “boil the frog” recession, with the U.S. slipping into recession at the same time as the rest of the global economy. T…]]></summary>

As the digital asset currently sits just above $30,000, its market dominance has remained above 50% and while this is good for Bitcoin, the implications for altcoins in the space could be greater.
 
Bitcoin Dominance Returns To 2021 Levels
 
Bitcoin’s dominance has risen to its highest level in the past two years. The dominance which had rapidly declined in 2021 rose back quickly between March and June to hit a local high of around 52% dominance for the first time since April 2021.
 
 
This rise in dominance reflects the fact that most of the market rally has been limited to just Bitcoin, despite altcoins seeing some upside. As…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-26T19:36:04.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The parallel market exchange rate of the Cuban peso versus the greenback recently dropped to CUP200 per dollar, a level last seen in Oct. 2022, a report has said. Pavel Vidal, a former economist at the Cuban central bank, said the peso’s depreciation has caused the “impoverishment of the economy and families in dollar terms.”
 
Peso Down by More Than 20% in 2023
 
According to data provided by El Toque, the Cuban peso’s exchange rate on the parallel market recently matched an all-time low of 200 per dollar last seen in Oct. 2022. The peso’s latest plunge means the currency, which is officially pegged at CUP25:USD1, has now depreciated by over 20% in 2023 alone and by more than 50% in under 12 months.
 
As per a report, the peso’s latest plunge has further eroded the purchasing power of Cuban salaries which rarely exceed an equivalent of $25 or 5,000 pesos per month. The currency’s accelerated depreciation is coming at a time when the country’s leader, Miguel Diaz-Canel, has joined other world leaders in advocating for an alternative to the U.S. dollar.
 

 
Commenting on the likely impact of the Central American state’s ongoing currency woes on the population, Pavel Vidal, a former economist at the Cuban central bank, said the peso’s depreciation has left many residents worse off.
 
“The exchange rate shows the impoverishment of the economy and families in dollar terms,” Vidal, a tutor at Colombia’s Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali, said.
 
Although Cuba is reported to have carried out some market reforms, Vidal insisted that such reforms have failed to boost domestic production. The tutor also argued that the market reforms had failed to contain inflation.
 
However, Cuban officials including President Diaz-Canel have consistently blamed the country’s economic woes on sanctions imposed by the U.S. in the 1960s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swiss prosecutors have taken possession of approximately $26 million worth of crypto assets and US dollars belonging to Do Kwon, the imprisoned co-founder of Terraform Labs (TFL).
 
Now, the New York Federal Prosecutors Office and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have reportedly requested Swiss prosecutors to freeze cryptocurrency assets and fiat currency associated with Terraform Labs.
 
Allegedly, the assets in question were stored at Sygnum Bank, a bank that positions itself as the world’s inaugural digital assets bank and operates branches in Switzerland, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi.
 
The US SEC claims that Do Kwon had utilized a Swiss banking institution to convert 10,000 BTC into cash following the collapse of LUNA/UST in 2022.
