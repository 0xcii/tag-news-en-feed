This decrease in gas fees has made all on-chain operations, including asset swaps, cross-chain bridging, and non-fungible token (NFT) minting, considerably more affordable for users.
 
 
Dencun Upgrade Lowers Ethereum Fees
 
The plunge in transaction fees has impacted several operations on the Ethereum network. For instance, according to data from Etherscan, asset swaps can now be executed for just $7.32, bridging at $2.35, and borrowing at $6.21, while NFT minting is priced at roughly $12.37.

Taking to X, the analyst posts several reasons to negate concerns by skeptics even with the coin trading 30% from March 2024 highs when prices broke above $4,000. By this take, doubts about future gains could be unfounded as they paint an overly pessimistic outlook for the second most valuable cryptocurrency.
