        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The SEC has been busy, meeting with all of the potential issuers of spot Bitcoin ETFs with active applications in December. These meetings have resulted in the universal adoption of a cash creation methodology by those issuers instead of “in kind” transfers, as is typical for other ETFs. Much has been said about this change, ranging from the absurd to the serious. The TLDR, however, is the overall impact will be minimal to investors, relatively meaningful to the issuers and it reflects poorly on the SEC overall.
In order to provide context, it is important to describe the basic structure of Exchange Traded Funds. ETF issuers all engage with a group of Authorized Participants (APs) that have the ability to exchange either a predefined amount of the funds assets (stocks, bonds, commodities, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The year 2023 marked a significant surge in the  
crypto investment landscape, witnessing a staggering $2.2 billion inflow into  
digital asset investment exchange-traded products (ETPs). 
This surge, unveiled by CoinShares' data cited by  
Coindesk, showcased a significant shift, notably driven by the escalating  
anticipation surrounding spot Bitcoin ETFs.
According to James Butterfill from CoinShares, the  
surge in the final quarter was propelled by mounting enthusiasm as the SEC  
hinted at potential approvals for Bitcoin spot-based ETFs in the United States.  

Bitcoin Records Soaring Inflows
The momentum of this surge in investment was  
observed in the final week of 2023. During this period, there was an influx of  
$243 million into digital asset ETPs, underlining the heightened investor  
interest in cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin emerged as the frontrunner in these  
investments, capturing the largest share of $1.9 billion in inflows,  
representing a remarkable 87% of the total $2.2 billion. This dominance,  
unprecedented in the crypto investment landscape, marked a significant shift,  
surpassing the previous high of 80% in 2020.

— James Butterfill (@jbutterfill) January 3, 2024
The price rally of Bitcoin through the year  
contributed substantially to this surge, witnessing a notable 155% climb and  
concluding 2023 at an impressive $42,000.
While Bitcoin led the charge, Solana (SOL) also  
showcased a robust performance in 2023, garnering $167 million in net inflows.  
Ethereum (ETH), however, lagged with a comparatively modest $78 million  
in the same period.
