According to the latest analysis by crypto analytics firm Kaiko, DEX trading volumes experienced a notable increase in November, reaching $29 billion.
 
This resurgence marks a recovery from the multi-year low observed in September, yet it remains a stark contrast to the all-time high of approximately $124 billion recorded in May 2021, according to Kaiko.

Initially set to be extradited to the US on December 15, Do Kwon’s fate turned when the Montenegrin High Court ruled to prolong his stay until February 15, 2024. 
 
The decision stems from charges related to the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, which led to significant financial losses.
 
The High Court had previously ordered Kwon’s extradition by Friday, but his defense team appealed the decision in the appellate court in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro.
