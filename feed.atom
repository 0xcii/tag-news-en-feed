        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire has revealed that US customers only account for 30% of stablecoin USDC’s adoption. This may come as a surprise to many, considering that Circle and its USDC token have been thought to majorly be focused on the US market, especially considering its close ties with Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US.
 
Non-US Markets Driving Adoption
 
Allaire revealed in his tweet that non-US markets are, in fact, the ones driving USDC’s adoption. 
 
 
According to him: 
 

Despite the hype that we’re all about the US, we estimate that 70% of USDC adoption is non-US, and some of the fastest growing areas are emerging and developing markets.  Strong progress happening across Asia, LATAM and Africa.  Demand for safe, transparent digital dollars is strong.

Alderoty tweeted, “Crypto critic/x-SEC official John Reed Stark says there should be an investigation into Bill Hinman. This is broader than Ripple – there could potentially be serious conflicts of interest by a gov official. An investigation will either put it to rest or hold folks accountable.”
 
The statement by Alderoty came in response to John Reed Stark, who pointed to the various reports of Bill Hinman’s conflicts of interest. According to former SEC official Stark, there should be an FBI investigation. If misconduct by Hinman comes to light, the U.S. Department of Justice should take action.

At the current pace, Ethereum is torching around 1.75 million ETH annually, leading to a decrease in supply by approximately 0.98%. Technically, the platform is becoming slightly deflationary since the circulating supply of ETH is shrinking over time as the network actively burns coins.
