Clemente initiates his exposition with a reference to Bitcoin’s present situation, where despite facing a decline of nearly 70% from its 2021 highs, its potential remains undiminished. He reminded readers of Bitcoin’s inception, born out of the tumultuous aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s elusive creator, envisioned it as an antidote to the “moral hazard and incentives set in place” that could disrupt the very “fabric of financial perception.”
