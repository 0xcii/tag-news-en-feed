        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-falls-to-27000-ahead-of-us-consumer-confidence-report/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-25T12:39:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin remained close to a four-week low on Tuesday, as prices fell to a support point around $27,000. The decline came ahead of this afternoon’s U.S. consumer confidence report, which is expected to fall from 104.2, to a reading of 104 in April. Ethereum was also lower, and approached a breakout below the $1,800 level. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade near a one-month low, as markets prepared for the upcoming consumer confidence report in the United States.
 
Following a high of $27,701.26 during yesterday’s session, BTC/USD fell to a low of $27,070.85 on Tuesday.
 
This is the weakest point that bitcoin has fallen to since March 28, which is when it last traded below $27,000.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that this drop took place as the relative strength index (RSI) moved back towards a floor at 41.00
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 43.14, following a failed breakout of a ceiling at 45.00.
 
Should bears push the index below 41.00, there is a good chance that BTC will move to a lower floor at $26,500.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also in the red in today’s session, with bears pushing the price towards the $1,800 mark.
 
ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,807.74 on Tuesday, following a high at $1,874.11 the day prior.
 
Tuesday’s slippage came as ethereum fell below its recent support point at the $1,830 mark, which had been in place since April 4.
 
 
From the chart, this latest downturn came after the RSI indicator collided with a ceiling at the 48.00 level.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 43.67, with a support point at 42.00 a potential target for bears should momentum continue in its current direction.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average is now also nearing a cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could be a sign of upcoming declines.

Coinbase wants to force the SEC to respond with a “yes” or “no” to the petition, in which they ask the SEC to use its formal rulemaking process to provide guidance for the crypto industry. The agency is required by law to respond to the petition within a timely manner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
