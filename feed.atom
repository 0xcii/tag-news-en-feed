        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stellar was a notable mover during Saturday’s session, as the token returned to the green to start the weekend. Prices recently fell lower for six straight days, however, bulls have reentered the market snapping this streak in the process. Dogecoin also rebounded today. 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
Stellar (XLM) rose higher on Saturday, following a recent six-day losing streak which pushed the price to a multi-month low.
 
XLM/USD climbed to an intraday peak at $0.12 earlier in today’s session, which comes following a low of $0.1115 the day prior.
 
The move comes as stellar continued to move away from a support point at $0.110, which was hit on Thursday.
 
 
This was the first time the price collided with this floor since mid-June, and comes as the relative strength index (RSI) hit its own floor at 30.00.
 
At the time of writing this, the index has also rebounded and is now tracking at 34.84, which is marginally below a ceiling at 36.00.
 
Should it push past this point, the next likely price target will be around a ceiling of $0.1340.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
In addition to XLM, dogecoin (DOGE) was also in the green to start the weekend, as it bounced from a floor of its own.
 
After trading at a low of $0.06079 during Friday’s session, DOGE/USD surged to a peak of $0.06385 earlier in the day.
 
The jump in price came as the meme coin moved away from a support point of $0.0600, which is near a recent two-month low.
 
 
Similar to XLM, the RSI on the dogecoin chart has bounced from a support point at the 30.00 mark, and is now tracking at 34.13.
 
The next visible point of resistance is at the 44.00 mark, and should this point be hit, DOGE will likely be near $0.06600.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last week, CoinMarketCap reports that Ethereum (ETH) has lost 10.31% of its value marking a highly negative performance for the prominent altcoin. However, most of this price loss was driven by a general market crash on Thursday, which saw about $1 billion wiped out from the total crypto market cap. 
 
Interestingly, prominent on-chain analytics firm, Lookonchain reports that a particular “smart” whale was able to avoid this market turmoil by liquidating a substantial amount of ETH right before the market crashed.

        <updated>2023-08-19T13:10:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the weekend trading below $26,000, as the cryptocurrency had its worst week since the collapse of FTX. Market sentiment was bearish following reports that Spacex liquidated its bitcoin holdings. Ethereum remains below $1,700.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bears continued to circle bitcoin (BTC) to start the weekend, as the cryptocurrency had its biggest one-day decline since the collapse of FTX.
 
BTC/USD dropped to a low of $25,668.92 on Saturday, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $26,598.65.
 
As a result of today’s move, bitcoin remains close to a two-month low, with some traders targeting a breakout below $25,000.
 
 
Overall, the relative strength index (RSI) is deep in bearish territory, with a current reading of 18.56.
 
Price strength hasn’t tracked below 20.00 since January last year, which for some was the beginning of the so-called “crypto winter”.
 
Should there be further declines this weekend, the target will likely be a support point of $24,900.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was marginally higher on Saturday, as the price rebounded from a recent move below $1,600.
 
Following a high of $1,695.45 on Friday, ETH/USD fell to a bottom of $1,644.93 to start the weekend.
 
On Thursday, ethereum dropped to a low of $1,540, which was its weakest point since March 12, when the price was trading below the $1,459 level.
 
 
The 10-day (red) moving average is now firmly on a downward trend, after appearing as though it was nearing an upwards cross earlier in the week.
 
As of writing, ethereum seems to have found a firm floor around the $1,660 level.
