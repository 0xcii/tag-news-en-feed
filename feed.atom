        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The development kit is envisioned as having multiple components that would enable increase the accessibility and openness of bitcoin mining hardware.
Jack Dorsey’s Block has posted a new blog that details the Mining Development Kit, a new project that would seemingly replicate the Lightning Development Kit and Bitcoin Development Kit projects, providing developers access to bitcoin mining projects focused on integrating bitcoin mining into various novel use cases.
The blog describes how the company has started developing their own bitcoin mining semiconductor chips, saying that “These purpose-built application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are the leading way bitcoin is mined today and will serve as the foundation for a full suite of bitcoin mining products intended to increase the pace of innovation in bitcoin mining.” 
Block then says it is considering building the MDK, and they are seeking further feedback from the community. The MDK as Block “currently envisions it” would have four components:

A “powerful, reliable, industrial-grade” bitcoin mining hashboard.
A custom controller board designed to work with the hashboard.
Open-source firmware, a software API and a web front-end, that would allow developers to modify the key performance parameters of the hashboard.
And extensive reference materials and support documentation “to facilitate easy customization of the hashboard.”

“The intention behind the MDK is to provide developers with a suite of tools to help unlock creativity and innovation in bitcoin mining hardware,” describes the blog. “With the MDK, we see a significant opportunity to increase the accessibility and openness of bitcoin mining hardware, in order to accelerate innovation in the field.”
The post ends with a promise of future updates in the coming weeks and months, and a call to action for feedback that can be directed to mining@block.xyz.]]></summary>

But certain firms are still thriving amid the current state of the market. A notable example is Argo, a popular UK-based Bitcoin mining company. Argo Blockchain is one of the leading cryptocurrency mining companies in North America and Europe.
 
Argo Increases Bitcoin Production
 
On Tuesday, Argo announced an increase in its Bitcoin production despite the increased difficulty when it comes to mining the coin. The company reported producing 162 BTC in February, a 7% daily increase from the previous month.
 
According to Argo, this increase in production results from …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DC Circuit judges hammered the SEC’s lawyers as they defended their decision to not approve Grayscale’s move toward a spot bitcoin ETF.
Grayscale Investments LLC participated in oral arguments on Tuesday in the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in relation to its attempts to get its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) converted to a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). In these oral arguments, the three presiding judges seemingly sided with Grayscale in their positioning.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly denied previous attempts at the introduction of a spot bitcoin ETF. This has led to Grayscale suing the SEC, alleging that the decisions have been arbitrary and inconsistent with the Commission's decision to approve Bitcoin futures ETFs. 
In today’s arguments, presiding judges Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan and Judge Neomi Rao continually prodded the SEC Senior Counsel Emily Parise about the SEC’s differentiation between a futures ETF and a spot bitcoin ETF. 
“[The prices] move together 99.9% of the time. So where's the gap, in the Commission's view?” asked Judge Rao. 
The SEC response was that correlation does not equal causation, with its lawyers explaining that the key empirical question is whether fraud and manipulation in the spot markets affect futures in the same way so that they can rely on the surveillance of the future markets. Without that missing empirical piece, the SEC counsel said, the agency can't be sure it can rely on CME future surveillance to approve a spot ETF. 
Questioning led to the pontification that the SEC had not provided sufficient evidence to explain their decision making, with Judge Rao telling Parise, “The SEC has not offered any explanation that the petitioners are wrong.”
The full record of the questioning can be listened to here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp rose higher in Tuesday’s session, as prices continued to move away from a long-term support point. Overall, sentiment in cryptocurrencies remained largely bearish, with the global market cap down 0.34% as of writing. Polygon was also in the green at the time of writing. 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was a notable gainer on Tuesday, as the token continued to move away from a recent support point.
 
Following a low of $0.3648 to start the week, XRP/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.3751 earlier in the day.
 
The move resulted in XRP bouncing from a long-term price floor at $0.3650, following a recent four-day losing streak.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that this took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of its own ceiling at 43.00.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 43.97, with the next visible resistance point at 45.00.
 
Should this ceiling be hit, there is a strong chance that XRP will be trading at, or above, the $0.3800 mark.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) also rose higher in today’s session, a day after bulls rejected a breakout at a key price level.
 
MATIC/USD moved to a peak of $1.17 on Tuesday, which comes after a bottom at $1.12 the day prior.
 
As a result of this move, polygon bulls pushed prices further away from a recent floor at $1.10.
 
 
Overall, it appears that this rebound coincides with the RSI moving away from a recent floor at 39.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 41.17, with the nearest point of resistance being at the 45.00 mark.
 
Bulls could likely target this point, and should they reach it, MATIC could move above $1.20.

While other countries are in different stages of CBDC development, China has continued to pursue a wider adoption of e-CNY across its regions. The country has conducted many promotional activities, including gifting a certain amount to wallet owners and even dishing out lotteries in local communities.

        <updated>2023-03-07T16:23:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The funding will be used to expand the platform's retail Bitcoin on-ramp in Europe, add zero-fee trading, support for Lightning and more.
Relai, a Swiss non-custodial bitcoin platform, has announced a $4.5 million funding round led by Ego Death Capital. 
New investors include Timechain, Cabrit Capital and Lightning Ventures, while participating firms Redalpine and Fulgur Ventures are both previous investors.
In addition to this news, the company announced that Ego Death Capital general partner Andi Pitt will be joining Relai’s board. 
“The current bear market is the perfect time to focus on what’s most important: building a top-notch product, delivering a seamless user experience, and educating people about Bitcoin as the best savings technology ever invented,” said Relai CEO and co-founder Julian Liniger. “Our team is hungry for what’s ahead, and we have a crystal clear plan that we will execute in the coming months. With ego death capital and the great network around Jeff Booth, Andi Pitt, and Nico Lechuga, we are ready to bring bitcoin to everyone in Europe!“ 
The funding will go towards further expansion as a retail Bitcoin on-ramp in Europe. Relai currently has plans to add zero-fee trading, implement support for the Lightning Network and introduce a white-label product that will allow for other firms to offer fiat-to-bitcoin trading. Also in focus is the recently launched Relai Business platform. 
“We’ve been really impressed by Julian and the Relai team and their ability to deliver long term value to users,” commented Jeff Booth, general partner at ego death capital. “We believe they will be a key player for European Bitcoin adoption and are excited to work with them.”]]></summary>
