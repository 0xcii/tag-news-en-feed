        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After climbing by over 20% on Friday, litecoin extended gains to start the weekend, surging to its highest point in over a year. The move comes as momentum surrounding the token’s listing on EDX markets continues to grow. Dogecoin also recorded a strong start to the day.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was once again a big mover in cryptocurrency markets, as the token rallied to a multi-month high.
 
Following a low of $91.73 during Friday’s session, LTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $111.76 earlier today.
 
As a result of the rally, litecoin peaked at its strongest point since April 7 last year, when price reached a top at $116.00.
 
 
After breaking out of a ceiling at 61.00 on the relative strength index (RSI), LTC bulls took the index past yet another ceiling.
 
This time at the 68.00 level, with price strength peaking at 73.91 to start the weekend, which is its highest point since January.
 
Litecoin has since gone on to retreat from today’s high, and as of writing, is trading at $110.17.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Another notable gainer on Saturday was dogecoin (DOGE), which climbed to a three-week high to start the weekend.
 
DOGE/USD jumped to a peak of $0.07079 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after falling to $0.06264.
 
The move saw the world’s largest meme coin jump nearly 5% higher, hitting its highest level since June 10 in the process.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, Saturday’s surge saw dogecoin collide with a key resistance level at $0.07000, before dropping lower.
 
DOGE is now trading at $0.06835, with the RSI hovering around the 56.00 mark, which is marginally above a ceiling at 55.00.
 
A target of $0.0750 likely remains on the agenda for bulls, however they face some challenges this weekend in order to reach this point.

Celsius, a company that declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022, acknowledging its substantial debt of up to $10 billion, temporarily halted withdrawals just prior to the bankruptcy filing. 
 
Since then, Celsius has been actively collaborating with regulatory authorities to facilitate the repayment of funds to its debtors. 
 
Now, with the court’s decision, individuals who are owed money can initiate the process of converting their altcoins into Bitcoin and Ether, providing them with an opportunity to retrieve their assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum entered the month of July in the green, as price traded at a two-month high to start the weekend. Markets moved to rebound on Saturday, after better than expected consumer sentiment data in the United Stated spooked traders. Bitcoin also rebounded, after falling below $30,000 on Friday.
 
Bitcoin
 
After falling below the $30,000 level during Friday’s session, bitcoin (BTC) rebounded on Saturday, however sentiment was still somewhat bearish.
 
Following a high of $31,093.98 on Friday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low at $29,600.28 as the session progressed.
 
However, the price is now trading at $30,444.75, as bulls moved to buy the dip, pushing BTC higher to start the weekend.
 
 
As per the chart, the rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) found a floor at the 63.00 mark.
 
The index is now tracking at 65.64, and seems to be heading for a resistance point around the 70.00 level.
 
A collision with this target will likely result in bitcoin once again moving above $31,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
On the other hand, ethereum (ETH) was largely bullish to start the weekend, with price surging to a two-month high.
 
ETH/USD has peaked at $1,945.27 so far on Saturday, which comes a day after falling to a low at $1,831.28.
 
As a result of this rally, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency jumped to its strongest point since May 6.
 
 
One of the reasons for this move was a breakout, which saw the RSI move past a ceiling at the 58.00 point.
 
As of writing, it appears that this break may have been false, and the index is now at a reading of 58.17, giving up earlier gains.
 
ETH is now trading at $1,914.81.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lawmakers in Slovakia have adopted legislation that will reduce the tax burden for cryptocurrency holders in the country. Income derived from long-term investments in digital assets will also be relieved from healthcare taxes, the parliamentarians decided.
 
Investors in Slovakia to Pay 7% Tax on Income From Crypto Held More Than a Year
 
Members of the National Council of Slovakia, the country’s unicameral legislature, have approved an amendment that will reduce the taxation of cryptocurrencies, local media reported. Income from crypto assets sold more than a year after their purchase will be taxed at 7%.
 
Thus, the tax rate for long-term crypto holdings will be lower than the regular income tax rates. Slovaks pay personal income tax according to a progressive scale and the rate can be either 19% or 25%, for income exceeding a certain threshold.
 
The legislative proposal was submitted by the liberal Freedom and Solidarity party, the Democrats and the conservative Ordinary People and Independent Personalities party and backed by the We Are Family and Voice factions.
 
According to the updated law, gains from crypto investments will also be exempt from health taxes. Slovakia’s Ministry of Finance has estimated that the financial impact from the amendment will be around €30 million (almost $33 million) a year.
 
The tax exemptions come after earlier this month Slovak lawmakers sought to protect cash payments amid fears that the digital version of Europe’s common fiat currency, the euro, may eventually become the only means of payment across the eurozone.
 
The right to pay with cash for goods and services was enshrined in the country’s constitution through an amendment proposed by the right-wing and Euroskeptic We Are Family party. The latest legal changes will also exempt from taxation crypto payments for up to €2,400 ($2,600).
