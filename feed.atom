While the price performance of the Ether token has been uninspiring in recent months, an analyst has put forward an argument to support the position that the second-largest cryptocurrency might still be in a bullish trend. 
 
Here’s Why The ETH Price Never Stopped Being Bullish
 
In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Crypto Sunmoon made an interesting claim about the Ethereum price. According to the pundit, the price of the Ether token is still in a bullish trend despite its sustained decline over the past few months.

A prominent crypto analyst, Thor Hartvigsen, recently highlighted this issue in a detailed post on X, where he discussed the current state of Ethereum’s fee generation and supply dynamics.
 
 
Is ETH No longer Ultra-Sound money?
 
Hartvigsen pointed out that August 2024 is “on track to be the worst month in terms of fees generated on the Ethereum mainnet since early 2020.” This decline is largely attributed to the introduction of blobs in March, which allowed Layer 2 (L2) solutions to bypass paying significant fees to Ethereum and ETH holders.
