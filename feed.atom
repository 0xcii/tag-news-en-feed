        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The embattled crypto lender has filed a slew of voluntary bankruptcy notices in order to restructure itself.
Genesis’s two lending subsidiaries, Genesis Global Capital and Genesis Asia Pacific, have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
According to the announcement, the firm aims to enact “a global resolution to maximize value for all clients and stakeholders and strengthen its business for the future.”
In November 2022, Genesis Global Capital halted their operations, freezing withdrawals amidst a liquidity crisis that came as a result of the implosion of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. The lending arm was FTX’s largest unsecured lender, with claims amounting to more than $226 million.

As global regulators strive to bring transparency in the crypto sector, an annual report from on-chain analytics firm Chainalysis on the ransomware attack highlights a significant decrease in these activities. As per the report, the revenue of ransomware attacks fell by 40.58% in 2022. 
 
More specifically, the total funds from ransomware that hackers received from victims plummeted to $456 million in 2022 from $765.6 million in 2021. However, Chainalysis claims that the amount could be much higher as not all addresses linked to attacks have be…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-sol-rebounds-from-recent-losses-atom-5-higher-on-friday/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-20T17:08:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cosmos raced higher for a second straight session, after recently snapping a four-day losing streak. Friday’s move saw the token move closer to a key resistance level of $12.50. Solana also moved higher earlier in the day, as price bounced from a key support point. 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Cosmos (ATOM), was one of Friday’s notable gainers, as the token moved closer to a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $11.70 on Thursday, ATOM/USD raced to an intraday peak of $12.38 earlier today.
 
As a result of this move, cosmos moved towards a resistance point at the $12.50 level, which was last hit on Monday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also hovering near a ceiling of its own, at 66.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 65.85, which could lead to marginal consolidation, with earlier bulls opting to liquidate their positions.
 
However, should this aforementioned ceiling be broken, then it is likely that ATOM could move towards $13.00.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Like ATOM, solana (SOL) also edged higher, as the token continued to move away from a support point at $20.00.
 
SOL/USD rose to a high of $21.77 earlier in the session, and followed on from a low of $20.53 the day prior.
 
Today’s rally sees solana in a bullish attempt to regain market momentum, following recent declines in price.
 
 
As can be seen on the chart, the move took place despite the RSI remaining below its own ceiling at 68.00.
 
Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as traders seemed to be preparing for another reversal.
 
Currently solana is trading at $21.43, with longer-term bulls still likely targeting an exit at the $24.00 mark.

The latest Genesis bankruptcy filing raised even more concerns and conspiracy theories among crypto community members, with some believing all of the now-bankrupt crypto firms are somehow potentially connected. 
 
Though crypto lender Genesis Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing did not result in any significant move in the global crypto market, it’s beginning to create and encourage more skepticism and disbelief in the overall crypto industry as influencers and crypto analysts have started sharing thoughts and opinions related to the recent bankruptcy filing in the crypto industry.
