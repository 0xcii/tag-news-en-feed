a year marked by the resurgence of cryptocurrencies, the global interest in  
cryptocurrency storage applications has experienced a notable decline. Recent  
data reveals that cryptocurrency wallets witnessed a total of 73.6 million

Declining  
Interest in Crypto Wallets
This

Deaton tweeted, “When the XRP case was filed on Clayton’s last day in charge at the SEC, I immediately pointed out the massive conflicts of interest by him voting to bring an enforcement action against Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen.”

quarter of 2023 has been challenging for the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) market,  
with sales hitting their lowest point since the last quarter of 2020. September  
alone recorded a dismal sales figure of around $300 million. This downturn is primarily  
attributed to a significant drop in average sales prices and floor prices of  
popular collections.
The Downward Spiral of NFT  
Sales
The NFT  
market has been on a downward trajectory, particularly in September, which saw  
the worst sales figures since January 2021. The average sales price in September  
plummeted to $38.17, a stark contrast to its peak of $791.84 in August 2021.

Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority

From the

However, the problem is that such products' definitions are quite vague.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum (ETH) has witnessed a notable resurgence, reclaiming ground after hitting a crucial support level at $1,500. As traders analyze the daily time frame, it becomes evident that this resurgence may signify the formation of a bullish reversal pattern, known as a double bottom. 
 
A double bottom is a classic technical analysis pattern that often signals a potential trend reversal. It consists of two troughs or valleys formed on a price chart. In this case, Ethereum touched the $1,500 support level twice, suggesting strong buying interest at this price point. 
 
This pattern indicates that bears may have exhausted their selling pressure, and buyers are gaining control, potentially setting the stage for a bullish move.
