Kris Marszlek, the CEO of Crypto.com, mentioned:  
"Positioning our brand through engaging campaigns and iconic partnerships  
has made Crypto.com a household name. But I'm most proud of the fact that we've  
surpassed the 100 million user milestone while building the most widely  
regulated platform in the industry by leading in global licenses and  
registrations."
In May, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority  
(VARA) licensed Crypto.com for full operation in institutional crypto trading.  
The exchange regional arm, CRO DAX Middle East FZE, was granted a Virtual Asset  
Service Provider license in 2023. 
Crypto.com Exchange, designed for both institutional  
and qualified retail investors, offers a suite of services, including spot  
trading, staking brokerage, and over-the-counter offerings. With plans to roll  
out the Crypto.com app and other products for retail investors in the region,  
Crypto.com aims to strengthen its position in the global cryptocurrency market.
Global Expansion Initiatives
Beyond Dubai, Crypto.com is expanding its presence  
globally. This includes the recent announcement of a specialized trading  
platform for Korean users.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.
