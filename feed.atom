        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last week, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has seen a steady decline as prices have struggled to hold up in the market. Following the Bitcoin price crash below $50,000 that rocked the market, the index plunged farther into fear. The result of this is the lowest level that the index has been in the last two years.
 
Why The Crypto Fear & Greed Index Is Important
 
The Crypto Fear & Greed Index uses a number scale of 1-100 to represent the market sentiment at any given time. This scale measures a number of indicators such as social media keywords, market volatility and volume, and dominance in the market.
 
 
With the data collected, the index uses numbers to represent whether investors are feeling fearful, greedy, or neutral and to what extent they are feeling this. A score of 1-24 r…]]></summary>

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 5, 2024
  
  
  
Semler adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy in May 2024, following other public companies like MicroStrategy. Since then, it has aggressively acquired Bitcoin, citing it as a "compelling investment."
"We continue to firmly believe that Bitcoin is a compelling investment and plan to acquire additional Bitcoins with our cash from operations," said Semler chairman Eric Semler.
He added, "We plan on acquiring additional bitcoins with our cash from operations, as well as with cash generated from the sale of securities under our $150.0 million shelf registration statement, once effective."
On May 28, Semler bought 581 BTC for $40 million. It followed up with 247 BTC for $17 million on June 6 and another 49 BTC for $3 million on June 28. As of August 5, its 929 BTC are worth over $63 million.
Semler is closely mimicking MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has purchased over 220,000 BTC worth billions, making it the largest corporate holder. Its Bitcoin bet has increased MicroStrategy's enterprise value dramatically.
Other public companies in tech and financial services, such as Tesla, Block, and Mercado Bitcoin, have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Over 50 public companies hold Bitcoin on their books.
Bitcoin's network effects and game theory are driving this corporate adoption. As more firms buy Bitcoin as a reserve asset, it propels other companies to follow suit to avoid missing out.]]></summary>

from the 255 reported in June when Bitcoin prices were falling sharply.  
Although this is 10% less than in July 2023 (410 BTC), considering the average
