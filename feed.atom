        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changpeng Zhao, the ousted CEO of cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance, walked away from court this week with a sentence many see as a slap on the wrist.
 
Zhao, better known in the crypto world as “CZ,” received four months in prison for failing to implement sufficient anti-money laundering (AML) safeguards at Binance.
 
 
Binance Founder: Guilty But Not Laundering?
 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) did not directly accuse Zhao of money laundering itself. Instead, the charges focused on his company’s inadequate AML programs, which allegedly allowed criminals to funnel illicit funds through the exchange.
 
This distinction proved crucial in the sentencing, with some legal analysts suggesting federal guidelines for nonviolent first-time offenders limited the judge’s options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) convenes for a highly anticipated meeting today (2 pm ET), the stakes are high not just for traditional finance but also for the crypto markets, which have become increasingly sensitive to macroeconomic signals. Kurt S. Altrichter, a notable financial advisor, has provided an in-depth analysis of possible outcomes and their ramifications on X, offering a roadmap of expectations for market participants.
 
Altrichter points out that despite the scaling back of rate cut expectations—from six expected cuts at the start of the year to just one by year’s end—the markets have shown resilience. This is largely because investors still anticipate the next Federal Reserve move to be a cut, not an increase. For the crypto market, this has meant a precarious …]]></summary>

The authorities in the United States will now seek his extradition.
According to an announcement by the Justice Department yesterday (Monday), Ver evaded at least $48 million in taxes in the United States.
The Face of Bitcoin Cash
Ver is a vocal crypto advocate who even gained the title of “Bitcoin Jesus” in the early years of cryptocurrency adoption. However, he disagreed with the majority of the Bitcoin miners who opposed changes to the blockchain, leading to the creation of Bitcoin Cash. Ver became a strong advocate for Bitcoin Cash.

The second largest cryptocurrency has also been in the spotlight after a key component in its ecosystem, Consensys, sued the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for “unlawful seizure of authority” over the asset.
 
The lawsuit sparked different conversations, including the SEC’s regulatory inconsistencies and speculation about the relationship between the US agency and people close to Ethereum.

On April 25, blockchain software company Consensys filed a lawsuit against the US SEC. The lawsuit seeks a court ruling that declares ETH is not a security.

Data from Shibariumscan shows that the number of active accounts on the layer-2 network rose from 1290 on April 27 to 3,839 on April 28, representing over a 144% increase. Such development is bullish for Shiba Inu, considering how the layer-2 network has been integral to the meme coin’s success since it launched last year.
