Sam Bankman-Fried Downplayed The Negative Balance
 
During direct examination on October 16, Singh had mentioned that Alameda Research’s negative balance had grown to as much as $8 billion, something which he heard from a conversation between FTX’s co-founder Gary Wang and Adam Yedidia.

The two companies said they would work on a solution that enables Valr customers to use the card firm’s network to make or receive payments.
 
Harnessing Visa’s Vast Experience and Global Reach
 
The South African crypto exchange Valr has partnered with the global payment card services corporation Visa to expand the use of crypto payments inside and outside the African country. The partnership arrangement means the two firms will collaborate on payment solutions that leverage the crypto exchange’s expertise and Visa’s capabilities.
 
Farzam Ehsani, the CEO and co-founder at Valr, lauded the partnership as a step that allows the crypto exchange to widen its range of products.
 
“Visa is a household name in payments, with vast experience and global reach. A partnership with Visa was a natural step for VALR as we bring more innovative products and services to our customer base,” Ehsani said.
 

 
Lineshree Moodley, the general manager for Visa South Africa, said the two companies would work on a solution that enables Valr customers to use the card firm’s network to make or receive payments.
 
For Valr, the announcement of the partnership with Visa represents another step in the crypto exchange’s endeavor to become a global digital asset platform. It also comes just under a month after the crypto exchange said it had commenced the process to acquire a license in the UAE.

Ark Invest, in collaboration with 21 Shares, became the pioneering applicant to revise its submission in direct response to the SEC’s feedback in recent days, as Bitcoinist reported.
