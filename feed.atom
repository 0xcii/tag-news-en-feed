At the recent Libertarian National Convention, President Trump vowed to “stop Joe Biden’s crusade to crush crypto,” and assured Bitcoin holders specifically that he supports the right to self-custody.
“I say this with your vote, I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your Bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency,” President Trump said.
