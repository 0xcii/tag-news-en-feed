During the period of the extension, the crypto firm plans to bring into place a restructuring plan via a new decentralized finance project named Hope. This initiative will allow the firm to explore new opportunities for growth and sustainability within the crypto lending market.

In the retail trading industry, many were curious about the nuts and bolts of the deal, which can be meaningful for pretty much every major broker and provider. The terms were famously not disclosed, but Finance Magnates sat down with eToro's UK Managing Director Dan Moczulski, to get a glimpse into its facets.   
Asked whether any user data could be shared between the two platforms, Mr Moczulski stated, “No, nothing. It’s a marketing deal at the moment.”
 And, on the subject of KYC checks, he explained: “What's not happening is, you click on Twitter, on $APPL, and suddenly, if you're not an eToro user, you get the ability to buy or sell Apple.

About 77% Of The Total Bitcoin Supply Is Now In Profit
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, a total of 6.2 million BTC has come back into the green this year. The relevant indicator here is the “percent supply in profit,” which tells us what percentage of the Bitcoin supply is currently carrying some amount of unrealized profit.
 
The metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in the circulating supply and checking what price it was last moved at. If this previous price for any coin was less than the current BTC value, then that specific coin is carrying a profit right now, and the indicator adds it to its value.
