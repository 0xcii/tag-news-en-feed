Brandt, known for his uncanny ability to predict market movements, believes a short-term buying signal is emerging despite the coin hovering precariously near support levels. However, whispers of caution linger as market volatility continues to cast a shadow over the digital asset.
 
 
Foot Shot Pattern: A Sign Of Weakness Or Hidden Strength?
 
Brandt’s analysis hinges on a technical indicator known as the “foot shot pattern,” which historically has preceded price increases. This bullish interpretation stands in stark contrast to the current market sentiment, which is decidedly bearish.

Due to the enormous scale of the transactions, selloffs by the government can be classified as whale movements. Many market participants can also argue that they’ve contributed to an increase in selling pressure and a price decline for Bitcoin. 
 
 
However, Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, doesn’t resonate with this school of thought. According to him, reactions to selloffs from wallets linked to governments are mostly overrated. Interestingly, his take is based on the cumulative value of Bitcoin inflows in the past year.
