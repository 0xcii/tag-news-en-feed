        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scam artists in the financial and crypto space often reveal a knack for adaptation. The latest trend in Ireland’s fraud landscape signifies a significant shift in focus, with scammers now setting their sights on traditional banking customers. 
 
This pivot, as reported by the Irish Independent, comes in the wake of a substantial dip in the frequency of cryptocurrency scams. While the crypto market has endured a prolonged bear run, the traditional banking sector has become the prime hunting ground for these illicit actors, resulting in a staggering loss of nearly 20 million euros ($21.8 million) to banking-related scams in 2023 alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The global banking regulators have taken a  
significant step towards increasing transparency in the financial sector. The  
Basel Committee, comprising banking regulators from major global financial  
hubs, has introduced a proposal to enforce standardized disclosure of crypto  
assets by major banks starting from January 2025. 
This move aims to bolster "market  
discipline" by offering investors a comprehensive view of banks' crypto  
holdings and activities. The Basel Committee, one of the Bank for International  
Settlements (BIS) committees, took this step after establishing new rules in  
December last year that dictate the amount of capital banks must maintain to  
cover various categories of crypto assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On October 16, 2023, Bitcoin’s difficulty impressively crossed the 61 trillion mark at block height 812,448, setting a fresh benchmark for the network. This ascent marked the fourth-largest rise in difficulty for the year. Yet, in the face of this increase, the hashrate has steadily and unflinchingly risen.
 
Bitcoin’s Difficulty Explodes to 61 Trillion, Hashrate Unyieldingly Marches Onward
 
On the heels of a 6.47% leap on Monday, Bitcoin’s difficulty peaked at an unprecedented 61.03 trillion, signifying the year’s fourth most significant spike. Miners previously navigated two back-to-back hikes: a 5.48% rise on September 19, followed by a slight 0.35% nudge upward on October 3.
 
Yet, despite these challenges, the hashrate is approaching its zenith, closely mirroring the high seen on October 12, 2023. By Tuesday, October 17, post the 6.47% surge in difficulty, the hashrate gracefully sails at 444 exahash per second (EH/s).
 

 
About 42 mining coalitions are pouring their hashrate into the Bitcoin chain, with the top five being Foundry USA, Antpool, Viabtc, F2pool, and Binance Pool. Over the last three days, Foundry has taken the lead, contributing 133.25 EH/s or 30.15% of the overall network’s hashrate, while Antpool churned out 116.95 EH/s, constituting 26.46% of the collective hashrate.
 
 
Come October 29, 2023, the next anticipated shift in difficulty is set to roll out after over 1,800 blocks are discovered. Notably, block intervals have consistently fallen short of the typical ten-minute mark, ranging between 9 minutes and 13 seconds and 9 minutes and 37 seconds.
 
The current block times suggest (unless things change) that if the hashrate persists in its vigor and block durations linger below the ten-minute threshold, we might see another hike. Projections currently hint at a potential increase anywhere between 0.18% to 4.2%.

Even though Bitcoin retraced this move shortly after the revelation of the misinformation, the rapid price movement has left many crypto analysts speculating on the potential price impact should a Bitcoin Spot ETF gain genuine approval.
 
Remarkably, BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, remained a vocal supporter of Bitcoin following the event, stating in a TV interview yesterday that it exemplifies the “pent-up interest in crypto.” Due to securities laws and the pending ETF application, he refrained from mentioning “Bitcoin” dire…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-17T13:39:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin remained near a two-month high on Tuesday, as markets digested the latest retail sales figures from the United States. Sales, which account for two thirds of the U.S. economy, rose by 0.7% in September, 0.4% higher than expected. Ethereum briefly rose above $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin continued to trade above $28,000 on Tuesday, following a better than expected increase in U.S. retail sales.
 
Despite slipping from a peak of $30,000 on Monday, BTC/USD traded above $28,600 in today’s session.
 
Although gains have eased, this was still considerably higher than yesterday’s low at the $27,855.21 level.
 
 
Overall, the recent upward trend means bitcoin is trading at its highest rate since August 18, which comes after the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a key resistance level.
 
The index surged beyond a ceiling at 63.00 in yesterday’s session, peaking above the 65.00 mark.
 
Price strength has since retreated, however is still marginally above the aforementioned point of resistance.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH), was lower in today’s session, after a brief stint trading above the $1,600 mark for the first time in almost ten days.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,628.16 to start the week, on the back of a tweet from Cointelegraph that suggested Blackrock’s spot bitcoin ETF was approved.
 
After these claims were proven to be incorrect, the cryptocurrency has since slipped, falling to a low at $1,570.89 earlier today.
 
 
As a result of Tuesday’s decline, bears have snapped a four-day win streak, and could now be targeting a floor at $1,540.
 
From the chart, it appears that a failure to move beyond a ceiling at 49.00 on the RSI indicator also contributed to today’s decline.

In a recent post on the social media platform X, Pentoshi outlined the foundation of their forecast. They pointed out that when the US government resorts to debasing the dollar to address its staggering debt, the king coin is poised to shine.
