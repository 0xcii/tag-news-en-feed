        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-atom-hits-2-month-high-as-xrp-extends-recent-gains/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-11T16:13:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cosmos rallied to a two-month high on Thursday, as cryptocurrency prices rebounded following Wednesday’s decline. Xrp was also mostly in the green in today’s session, extending recent gains in the process. The global crypto market cap is trading 0.17% higher as of writing.
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Cosmos (ATOM) raced to a two-month high on Wednesday, as the token climbed to its strongest point since November.
 
Following a low of $11.10, ATOM/USD raced to a peak of $11.44 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of this latest surge in price, cosmos moved to its highest point since Nov. 12.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s rally occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) ventured deeper into overbought territory.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average (MA), continued its upward ascent versus the 25-day (blue) MA.
 
However, sentiment could soon be shifting, with bears looking to re-enter the market as the RSI is now tracking at a level not seen since last January.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP (formerly ripple) was another big mover in today’s session, extending recent gains to a fourth consecutive day.
 
So far on Thursday, XRP/USD has risen to an intraday high of $0.3691, which comes less than a day after hitting a bottom of $0.348.
 
Following this rally, xrp neared a four-week high, as prices moved to their highest point since December 16.
 
 
This latest price surge comes as the RSI moved beyond a resistance point at 57.00, and it is currently tracking at 59.41.
 
As a result of this move, the 10-day (red) moving average is now close to a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should this upwards cross occur, it is likely that XRP will continue to move towards its long-term target of $0.40.

Gemini has officially put a stop to the interest-bearing product, which is the flagship Earn program. This message was circulated via email on January 10.
 
Gemini has ceased the existing Master Loan Agreements with Genesis Global Capital, which was responsible for operating the Earn program on behalf of its customers.
 
 
This move by Gemini comes as an extension of the public dispute that happened between Genesis and itself. In the email sent to the Gemini customers on Tuesday, Gemini mentioned that it was closing up the program in an attempt to get Genesis to repay the $900 million that the company owes the exchange’s clients.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin raced to a fresh multi-week high on Wednesday, as markets turned their attention to tomorrow’s U.S. inflation rate report. Thursday’s report is expected to show that consumer prices have fallen to 6.5%, down from 7.1% the month prior. Ethereum also rose marginally higher in the day.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rallied above a key resistance level on Wednesday, ahead of tomorrow’s U.S. inflation report.
 
Following a low of $17,226.64 on Tuesday, BTC/USD raced to a peak of $17,493.32 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed to its strongest point since December 15.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s price surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a resistance point at the 60.00 mark.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 63.80. This comes as BTC continues to hover around its own ceiling at the $17,400 mark.
 
In order to move closer to the $18,000 zone, the RSI will first need to move beyond a ceiling of 64.00 on the RSI.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also marginally higher in today’s session, with prices continuing to trade below a long-term ceiling
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,342.76 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,324.97.
 
Overall, ethereum remains below a resistance point of $1,350, with many expecting prices to move after the release of U.S. inflation figures tomorrow.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the consolidation below this price ceiling comes as the RSI continues to trade under a hurdle of its own.
 
Price strength is now tracking at the 68.73 level, which is under a point of resistance at the 70.00 mark.
 
ETH bulls are likely still targeting a move beyond $1,400, however, in order for this to happen, the RSI level of 70.00 must first be overcome.

Bitcoin Spot Trading Volume Has Gone Up A Bit This Week
 
As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, there has been low speculative activity in the BTC market recently. The “trading volume” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin being transacted on the Bitwise 10 exchanges on any given day.
 
While the volume on the Bitwise 10 exchanges is certainly not all the activity there is in the entire BTC market, the reason why they have been chosen is that their data is the most reliable available out of all the platforms, and their volumes still provide a decent approximation for what the trend in the complete s…]]></summary>

This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, a content creator and small business owner.
Nothing is more critical to long-term health than having access to healthcare when needed. But every jurisdiction around the world implements this process differently. Many countries socialize the cost of healthcare through the government on a sliding scale from total government control to private market healthcare, with a sprinkle of government-provided health insurance for the poor and the elderly.
In the United States, we primarily have a private healthcare system. If you have the money, you can purchase healthcare services from any service provider you like. But the problem in America isn't…]]></summary>
