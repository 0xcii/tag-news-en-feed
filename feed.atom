Friendsies NFT Project: A Rug Pull?
 
The Friendsies team announced on February 21 that the “volatile nature” of the cryptocurrency market made it difficult to advance the project. So, they have chosen to suspend the initiative till the market becomes more “stable and mature.”

If SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and his agency prevail in the case, the crypto industry can expect an even tougher crackdown from the U.S. regulator. However, the motives could be highly questionable.
