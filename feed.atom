However, pro-XRP legal expert Fred Rispoli has outlined why this is unlikely.
 
SEC Unlikely To Sue Ripple Founders
 
Rispoli stated in a tweet that the SEC is unlikely to pursue a trial against Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen for “many reasons.” 
 
 
 
 
The agency had accused Ripple Labs of selling unregistered securities back in 2020. But although it highlighted Garlinghouse and Larsen as integral to the wrongdoing, it never brought an action specifically against the duo.
 
It is not unusual for the SEC to bring actions against top executives whenever it files a suit aga…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-largely-unchanged-despite-fed-chair-powells-inflation-warning/"/>
        <updated>2023-08-26T11:43:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin remained largely unchanged on Saturday, as markets were mostly unmoved by comments from the Federal Reserve’s chair, Jerome Powell. Speaking at the annual Jackson Hole symposium, Powell hinted that more hikes were in the cards. Ethereum moved back towards a recent support point.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin continued to trade near the $26,000 region to start the weekend, as markets failed to react to Jerome Powell’s comments at the Jackson Hole symposium.
 
Powell stated that, “We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $25,914.93 on the comments, following Friday’s high at $26,406.15.
 
 
Price has since moved back above $26,000, as the relative strength index (RSI) began to trend sideways.
 
As of writing, price strength is now tracking at 25.71, which is closer to a ceiling of 29.00 than a floor of 20.00.
 
Should the index move beyond the 29.00 level, there could be more bulls reentering the market.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) edged lower on Saturday, as traders were underwhelmed by yesterday’s speech by the Fed chair.
 
Following a peak at $1,665.14 during yesterday’s session, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,641.63 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the decline, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moved below a support point of $1,650.
 
 
This week has seen ETH mostly trade between a low of $1,580 and a high of $1,690, with some occasional breakouts.
 
For bulls, a surge will need to occur at the resistance level of 33.00 on the RSI, in order for momentum to truly shift upward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Trump Digital Trading Cards, a non-fungible token (NFT) collection featuring illustrations of Donald Trump, experienced a surge in price and trading volume following a week many would refer to as “eventful” in the US political landscape. 
 
This spike in trading activity has been linked to the release of the former United States president’s mugshot and his interview with a former Fox News host, Tucker Carlson.
 
On Thursday, August 24, Donald Trump’s mugshot was taken and circulated after he turned himself in at the Fulton County Sheriff’s office as part of his criminal case in Georgia for allegedly trying to manipulate the will of voters in the 2020 election.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. The cryptocurrency market lacks regulation, leading to potential risks for investors, including SIM-swap scams. By this technique, hackers manipulate mobile carrier customer service to gain access to a user’s phone number, allowing them to bypass security measures and access accounts. Bart Stephens, co-founder of Blockchain Capital, fell victim to a SIM-swap attack, resulting in a $6.3 million Bitcoin theft. He has filed a lawsuit against the hackers. From all this it’s clear there’s a lack of effective safeguards and timely notifications from mobile phone carriers. Jellyfish Mobile provides a solution to prevent SIM-swap attacks and other vulnerabilities arising from cell phone carriers’ negligence.
