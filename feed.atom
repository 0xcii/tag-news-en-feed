        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) is one of the strongest assets in the crypto market, currently navigating a consolidation phase following three weeks of aggressive volatility marked by significant ups and even more significant downs. 
 
 
Despite the recent turbulence, Solana’s resilience has kept it on the radar of both analysts and investors, who are closely monitoring its price action. 
 
As this period of consolidation unfolds, there is growing speculation about the potential for massive gains ahead. Some market experts are already predicting that Solana could surge toward its all-time high of $260 later this year, driven by its robust ecosystem and continued adoption.

In a recent conversation on X, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan challenged the prevalent belief that financial instruments are a consequence of retail hysteria. He said institutional interest in their kind is sweeping the markets and setting records.
 
Bitcoin ETFs have earned nearly $18 billion since the start of the year. This is impressive considering that the Nasdaq-100 QQQs raised $5 billion in their first year. Bitcoin ETFs are on track to exceed one of the finest ETFs ever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a period of relative calm in recent days, characterized by low price volatility leading up to a 6% increase in the last 24 hours. The phase has been mostly characterized by low price volatility despite huge movements on-chain. 
 
 
Interestingly, it seems the trend has sparked an increase in SHIB accumulation among some large holders. As such, the accumulation has sparked theories of the return of a bullish upside for SHIB, which could mimic a rally witnessed in February. 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently been defined by significant whale transactions, underscoring the heightened activity among large holders. A prime example is the recent withdrawal of $1 million worth of SHIB from the crypto exchange Robinhood by the prominent market maker Wintermute.
