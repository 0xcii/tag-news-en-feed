        <updated>2023-12-02T05:05:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past six months, Bitcoin miners’ revenue has dropped by more than 30%, with November revenues approximately $270 million lower than October revenues. The drop in Bitcoin miners’ revenue is attributed to Bitcoin price volatility, increased competition, and higher electricity prices.
 
Gradual Decline in Miner Revenue
 

 
Bitcoin miners’ revenues have fallen by over 30% in the past six months, despite the gradual increase in the price of Bitcoin from its March 10 low of just over $20,000 to just over $38,000 on Dec. 1, 2023. According to banklesstimes.com data, miners’ November revenue of $615.1 million is approximately $300 million less than the January revenue.
 

 
Since reaching a high of $918.8 million in January, miners’ revenue has gradually declined in the months that followed. The month of October was the only time this trend was bucked, with miners securing the second-highest monthly earnings of 2023 at $885 million.
 

 
Commenting on the drop in miner revenue, Alice Leetham, an analyst at Banklesstimes, said:
 

This downturn has sparked widespread interest and concern within the cryptocurrency community, prompting us to delve into the factors contributing to this substantial decline.
 

 
In the Banklesstimes report, BTC price volatility is identified as one key factor explaining the drop in miners’ revenue. Meanwhile, an earlier report by Galaxy attributes the drop in revenue to what it described as the “incredible increase in network hashrate during the first half of the year.”
 
 

 
The increase in the hashrate is due to improved mining economics, the oversupply of second-hand ASICs in the secondary market, as well as the plugging in of new generation mining rigs. Other publications have attributed the revenue drop to the surge in energy prices.

President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has been granted a special license allowing him to temporarily step down from his presidential role to pursue a second term in the country's upcoming elections on February 4, 2024. This move aligns with a 2021 Supreme Court ruling and the constitutional interpretation, specifying that Bukele can only seek a second term if he vacates the presidency six months prior to the start of the subsequent presidential term, commencing on June 1, 2024.
Of notable concern to many Salvadorans was Bukele's security, particularly given his firm approach to combating criminal gangs, making him a potential target for these illicit groups. Addressing these concerns, the legislative assembly has approved his presidential security detail.
In the interim, Claudia Juana Rodríguez de Guevara was appointed the presidential designate. She will serve as the caretaker of the presidency until June 1, 2024. Rodríguez de Guevara has a longstanding professional relationship with Bukele, having held various roles alongside him throughout his career. Her most recent positions include serving as the private secretary of the presidency and as the president of the board of directors of the Municipal Works Directorate.
Despite her extensive background working with Bukele, Rodríguez de Guevara maintains a subtle public profile with minimal presence on social media platforms. As a caretaker, major policy changes during her tenure are unlikely. Her stance on significant issues, such as the country's policy regarding Bitcoin, remains undisclosed due to the temporary nature of her role. However, given her alignment with Bukele's past approaches, it's anticipated that she'll maintain continuity with the current administration's direction.]]></summary>
