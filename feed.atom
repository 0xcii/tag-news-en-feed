In his keynote speech at the Rare Evo 2024 event, Hoskinson issued a challenge to anyone who could hack the newly launched Lace Paper Wallet—for a prize money amounting to $1 million.
 
This is not about the money; it is more about ensuring that the Cardano ecosystem is always robust and secure. The challenge comes in handy as cyber threats continue to rise and further proofs that proactive security measures are a must in this evolving world of cryptocurrency.

Despite this, the price of XRP continues to face challenges, and it has not gained the momentum that many had hoped for after the lawsuit’s resolution.
 
 
Recently, a crypto market commenter with a decent following on social media platform X has termed XRP as the biggest scam in crypto. His reason for this claim? XRP’s failure to break on a price rally after the recent Ripple settlement in court.
