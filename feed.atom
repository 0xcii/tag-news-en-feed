“The Company and certain of its executives received a subpoena to produce documents and communications,” related to the facility in the third quarter of 2021, a quarterly filing by the company stated. 
In that agreement, Marathon issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted Common Stock, “in transactions exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.” However, the company filing revealed that it recently received another subpoena from the SEC on April 10, 2023, “relating to, among other things, transactions with related parties." 
The company says it is cooperating with the investigation. The facility in Montana was designed to have up to 100-megawatts of power, according to the filing.
Marathon’s stock price has been volatile in recent months, reflecting the ups and downs of the bitcoin market, however, the stock has generally followed an upward trend since early 2021, as the value of bitcoin has risen.]]></summary>

As in most cases, when a company undergoes bankruptcy, users are the most affected. Per a Bloomberg report, some BlockFi users have been denied access to the possibility of recovering their funds as they unintentionally forfeit their right over the crypto held on the lending platform.

the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, is facing backlash on

Pepe, which

The lead singer said it was timed to give fans a chance to get comfortable with Web3 technology ahead of the group's 2023 tour, when the NFT holders can use their Deathbats for early access to tickets. M. Shadows also talked to hosts Andrew Hayward and Stephen Graves about AI and bringing Web3 into gaming.]]></summary>
