In a statement released on July 27, SEC Chief Accountant Paul Munter expressed concerns about the potential for misleading information to be presented to investors through non-audit work, which he argued is not as rigorous or comprehensive as a financial statement audit. 
 
Munter warned accounting firms of the potential for legal liability if their clients make misleading statements about the nature of their services, which could lead to potential anti-fraud violations under federal securities laws.

The bill aims to ensure that individuals and businesses can store and manage their own digital assets securely, without unnecessary third-party involvement.
 
Bitcoin And Crypto Self-Custody Bill Passes
 
The bill’s primary objective is to prohibit Federal agencies from restricting the use of convertible virtual currency by a person for their own purposes, such as purchasing goods and services, and conducting transactions for any lawful purpose. The legislation also protects the right to self-custody digital assets using a self-hosted wallet or other secure means.
