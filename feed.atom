Lim, a former high-ranking official at Genesis Global Trading and Galaxy Digital, shared an in-depth analysis via X (formerly Twitter), laying bare the strategies and market movements preceding the much-anticipated spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).

This approach not only reveals the total number of participants in the transaction, but also incurs progressively higher transaction fees as the number of signers grow. MuSig, on the other hand, allows a group of users to collectively generate a single signature and public key to validate a transaction, which enhances privacy and lowers the transaction costs for all the signers involved. 
When MuSig was initially introduced in 2018, its main shortcoming compared to CHECKMULTISIG was user experience, specifically the requirement for three rounds of interactive communication between signers. With the introduct…]]></summary>

Recently, at the beginning of November, a report emerged about the abduction of executives from a Binance client, who were coerced into draining their cryptocurrency wallets.
