How bad is it? Well about 47% of the hashrate, on a good day. Yeah, pretty bad. 
Now why in Satoshi’s name would they do such a thing, you ask?

This strategy would be most beneficial to those who need guidance in securing profits as the meme coin continues to make significant price gains. 
 
Price Levels To Secure Profits From Shiba Inu
 
In a chart shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Crypto Noan highlighted four price targets from which Shiba Inu investors should look to take profits. The first take profit zone he highlighted was at $0.000028181. The second take profit zone was at $0.000032816; this serves as a moderate target for those who may not be satisfied with the returns at the initial take profit target.
