After closing August on a bearish note, the leading cryptocurrency has continued to exhibit signs of weakness after September began. The early days of the month have already seen Bitcoin edging further into bearish territory, a development that could potentially signal a prolonged period of capitulation throughout the rest of the month. However, keeping in mind this is BTC we’re talking about, and we’re only three days into September, we could see the crypto bounce back up sometime in the middle of the month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Fortune, Coinbase’s Chief Financial Officer, Alesia Haas, said that U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is using the company’s Commerce platform to accept cryptocurrency donations for her campaign. 
The statement was made during a conversation with Citigroup’s Director of Payments, Peter Christiansen, at the Citi 2024 Global TMT Conference in New York, in which Fortune reviewed a recording of the conversation.
 
                    
 
                         
                    
 
                     
                
“She is accepting crypto donations,” reportedly said Haas. “She’s using Coinbase Commerce now to accept crypto for her own campaign.”
However, pro-Harris advocacy group Crypto4Harris said that they were unaware of this move. Additionally, Harris's official fundraising site does not yet display crypto donation options. So far, Harris’s campaign and Coinbase were reached out to for comment, but Fortune has not heard back yet at the time of writing.
The "Crypto for Harris" initiative, launched last month, aims to garner support from crypto enthusiasts as Harris seeks to strengthen her presidential bid. 
“She has a huge opportunity, we’re cautiously optimistic,” Haas reportedly continued. “She has not rolled out the details yet, but she has made overtures that she would like to drive crypto legislation.”
Harris’ decision to accept cryptocurrency donations marks a strategic move to rival her opponent Donald Trump, who earlier this year embraced Bitcoin Lightning Network donations for his campaign. Trump's alignment with the Bitcoin community was further solidified when he spoke at The Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville—an event Harris notably declined to attend.]]></summary>

Privacy is a fundamental issue in using a public blockchain system like Bitcoin. Numerous projects and proposals have been made over the years to either build privacy preserving tools on top of Bitcoin, or fundamentally add privacy at the protocol layer itself. Satoshi himself discussed briefly the idea of zero knowledge proofs being a mechanism to enable greater privacy before he left. 
This is all the original whitepaper had to say on the topic of privacy:

Grewal said the bipartisan bill FIT 21 is a founding block for clear regulations and investor protection, and this should ultimately mean the crypto landscape focuses more on legislation rather than litigation. He also named European regulations as perhaps setting a model for the US approach toward crypto regulation.

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/u-s-spot-bitcoin-etfs-see-record-287-million-in-outflows-except-blackrock"/>
        <updated>2024-09-04T19:27:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a significant exodus of funds, with $287.8 million withdrawn across the listed ETFs yesterday, marking the largest single-day outflow since May 1, Farside Investors data reveals. According to Arkham data, the only ETF that did not experience withdrawals was BlackRock, which reported zero outflows.
  
                    
  
                          
                    
  
                      
                
Fidelity's ETF led the withdrawals, selling $162 million worth of Bitcoin. Grayscale followed with $50 million in outflows, while Ark and Bitwise reported $34 million and $25 million, respectively. Despite these substantial outflows, these ETFs still collectively manage around $50 billion in assets.
Bitcoin saw a remarkable rise in price earlier this year due to the hype and interest surrounding these ETFs, starting 2024 at around $44,000 and reaching an all-time high of $73,770 on March 14. However, the price has since stagnated, hovering below its peak in the $55,000 to $65,000 range. It has been 174 days since Bitcoin hit its all-time high, according to Clark Moody Dashboard.
Despite the recent outflows, spot Bitcoin ETFs have generally maintained strong inflows, with only one month of outflows in the past eight months. This indicates ongoing investor interest in Bitcoin, even as its price stabilizes below its all-time high.]]></summary>
