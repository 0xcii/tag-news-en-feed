        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Montenegro, caught in the crossfire of extradition battles between the United States and South Korea, has recently witnessed a significant turn of events in the case of disgraced crypto mogul Do Kwon. 
 
After a Montenegrin appeal court rejected his extradition to the US, Montenegro’s Supreme Court overturned earlier decisions to extradite Kwon to South Korea, Bloomberg recently reported. 
 
This development has bolstered US efforts to prosecute the former crypto mogul for fraud related to the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin in 2022. However, Do Kwon’s ultimate fate hangs in the balance as both the US and South Korea seek his extradition.
