Nasdaq’s Crypto Plans On Ice

The exchange operator had planned to launch the service by the end of the second quarter but now says it will no longer pursue a license related to the business.

Ordinarily, this may sound puzzling as there are a good number of digital assets service providers currently operating in France, such as Binance, Bistamp, Voyager, etc. However, the AMF notes that these businesses are only registered with its agency and do not possess a DASP license.
