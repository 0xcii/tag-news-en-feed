The story has come full circle as the lawsuit comes to a close on Wednesday, with jurors coming to a ruling in favor of the global fashion brand.
 
The ruling will undoubtedly serve as a pillar judgment in how NFT lawsuits – and potentially legislation – are evaluated in the years ahead.
 
Hermès And The MetaBirkin Debate 
Rewind to the simpler times of January 2022. Rothschild’s NFT project, MetaBirkins, was just a couple months into the making following a successful mint. But by mid-January last year, Hermès had filed a cease and desist, followed by a 47-page court filing against Rothschild and his NFT collection. Hermès argued that the coll…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ruling is the latest in a string of court cases that have ended with a decision against Craig Wright.
A United Kingdom court has ruled against Craig Wright, indicating that he has no copyright claim over Bitcoin’s code.
According to the Tuesday ruling, Wright’s claim that the formatting of Bitcoin blocks is his intellectual property failed in the court of law, due to the inability to demonstrate what is known as “fixation.” Fixation describes the ability to show the first recording of a piece of work, which Wright could not do. 
This is the latest in a series of court rulings against Wright’s favor, with the Norwegian courts ruling against him in the case against Hodlonaut, and the United Kingdom ruling against him in his case with Peter McCormack.
For Bitcoin developers and open-source code developers, the attacks by Craig Wright have been a moment of hesitancy, and even fear. The litigation that ties up developers as a result of these lawsuits is incredibly expensive, and creates major problems in the lives of developers. While funds have been put together before in order to support those who need it, rulings that reinforce the idea that Bitcoin is not a copyrighted code with limited access set important precedent. 
It also serves as a reminder of Bitcoin's open-source nature and reinforces the idea that anyone can contribute to its development without fear of legal repercussions. This ruling is a victory for open-source developers and the Bitcoin community.]]></summary>

Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Is At its Lowest Value Since November 2018
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, only $29.2 billion worth of BTC is left on exchanges now. There are two indicators of relevance here: the “supply on exchanges” and the “supply outside of exchanges.”
 
As their names already imply, they measure the total amount of Bitcoin currently sitting in centralized exchange wallets and the supply being kept in self-custodial wallets, respectively.
 
Generally, one of the main reasons investors deposit to exchanges is for selling purposes, so the supply on exchanges can reflect Bitcoin’s available selling supply.

Payments processor Pouch.ph and exchange Coins.ph, two leading players in the Philippines' cryptocurrency landscape, have announced their partnership to host the country's first-ever Bitcoin Island Retreat in Boracay. The event, which is slated to take place from March 27-29 2023, will bring together a host of bitcoin enthusiasts, thought leaders, investors and developers from around the world. The retreat aims to provide attendees with an opportunity to network, discuss bitcoin and interact with key players in the industry, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.
 
         
         
         
         
    
Over the past year, Boracay has transformed into one of the world's largest and most livable Bitcoin communities. With over 250 locations that accept Bitcoin payments, the island is a hub for enthusiasts and merchants who are looking to take advantage of the benefits offered by the Lightning Network. 
Ethan Rose, the founder and CEO of Pouch.ph, and Elijah Tan, the VP of operations at Coins.ph, will lead the trailblazers in the Bitcoin industry. Other speakers at the event include Jack Lee, the founder of HCM Capital and an early investor in Digital Currency Group; Augustus Ilag, a cryptocurrency investor who previously led Sequoia Capital's Southeast Asia crypto practice; and crypto educator Jiro Reyes, the founder of Bitskwela.
Attendees at the retreat will also have a chance to win a bitcoin bounty if they can find the 12-word seed phrase to a private key owned by Dread Pirate Nakamoto, which is placed around the island.
The Bitcoin Island Retreat is a unique opportunity for the Philippine crypto community to come together and explore the future of Bitcoin. The retreat is expected to be a landmark event that will be remembered for years to come. To reserve a spot, interested parties can visit https://pouch.ph/retreatrsvp.]]></summary>
