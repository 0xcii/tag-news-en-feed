        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A glimmer of hope emerged for Ripple Labs this week in their ongoing legal battle with the SEC. The Securities and Exchange Commission slashed its proposed settlement amount from a staggering $2 billion to a more manageable $102.6 million.
 
While this represents a significant concession, Ripple still faces a tough decision: accept the deal and live with the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s legal status, or risk a potentially disastrous court battle.
 
 
Ripple Cites Precedent, SEC Emphasizes Distinctions
 
The SEC’s initial $2 billion penalty sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency industry. Ripple, however, countered with a much lower offer of $10 million, citing the SEC’s own history of settlements typically ranging between 0.6% and 1.8% of the defendant’s revenue.
