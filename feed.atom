Was Roger Ver’s Indictment Celebrated?
 
On April 30, Roger Ver was detained by Spanish authorities on charges of tax evasion, mail fraud, and false tax returns. The indictment came the same day as former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao’s four-month sentence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The foremost meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), has entered a major accumulation zone, suggesting that this may be the right time to invest in the crypto token. This is also supported by the fact that the meme coin could soon experience a trend reversal from the current downtrend that it is experiencing. 
 
Dogecoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio Is A Buy Signal
 
Data from the market intelligence platform Santiment shows that Dogecoin’s 30-day MVRV ratio is around -15%, meaning many Dogecoin holders are currently at a loss. This negative MVRV ratio also signals a bottom for the meme coin, which usually ushers in a period of accumulation since the crypto token is currently undervalued.
