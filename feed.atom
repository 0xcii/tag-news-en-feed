The case concluded on August 7 with the company facing a civil penalty significantly less than the SEC originally demanded.
 
Judge Torres’s decision mandated a $125 million civil penalty for securities violations related to sales to institutions, along with a disgorgement of $0. This is a stark contrast to the approximately $2 billion in damages initially sought by the SEC. Additionally, an injunction was imposed to prevent further violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act.
