        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Privacy is a complicated subject. It's not always a simple binary thing, private or not private, seen or unseen. Seen by whom? Private from whom? Private to what degree? If you are walking down the street with a mask on your face no one can see your face, so that means you are private, right? What if you are the only one wearing a mask? Are you private then? People might not be able to see your face, but they can see that you are the only one wearing a mask. If you travel around the same areas frequently, people might not know your face and name, but they can consistently recognize you in the same way people do a familiar face simply by noticing the only person who wears a mask is back again. 
So does this really constitute privacy? People might not have your face, so they cannot recognize…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Commodity money is a form of money that derives an intrinsic value from its underlying commodity and the supply and demand dynamics. Gold and silver have been accepted as commodity money for centuries because of their scarcity and desirability.
Commodity money has some inherent limitations, such as the challenge of transportation and storage of larger quantities. This physical challenge is one of the primary reasons why it was replaced by more flexible solutions like representative and fiat money.
Commodity money is in contrast to representative money and fiat money. Representative money has no intrinsic value but represents something of value — such as gold or silver — for which it can be exchanged. Fiat money derives its value from the trust in the government that has established it as m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monetary Debasement
Debasement refers to the action or process of reducing the quality or value of something. In relation to money, it traditionally refers to the practice of reducing the precious metal content in coins while keeping their nominal value the same, thereby diluting the coin’s intrinsic worth. In a modern context, debasement has evolved to mean the reduction in the value or purchasing power of a currency — such as when central banks increase the supply of money, thereby lowering the nominal value of each unit.
Understanding Debasement
Before paper money, currency consisted of coins made of precious metals like gold and silver. Debasement was a common practice to save on precious metals and use them in a mix of lower-value metals instead.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ton-leads-bears-as-price-nears-fall-below-2/"/>
        <updated>2023-10-27T15:54:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin was a notable mover on Friday, as the cryptocurrency edged lower for a second straight session. Price fell by as much as 4% earlier in the day, as price approached a breakout below the $2.00 mark. On the other hand, solana continued to trade around the $33.00 mark.
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin dropped for a second straight day on Friday, as bears pushed the cryptocurrency close to a breakout below the $2.00 level.
 
Following a high of $2.17 during yesterday’s session, TON/USD slipped to an intraday low of $2.07 earlier today.
 
As a result of the decline, toncoin continued to track a one-week low, and close to a key price floor of $2.00.
 
 
One reason TON remains above the aforementioned level is as a result of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is above its own floor at 50.00.
 
In the event that this point is broken, there is a strong possibility that bearish sentiment will significantly increase.
 
If so, traders will possibly be targeting a lower support point of $1.90.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) made slight gains earlier in the day, as the token hovered close to a one-year low above $33.00.
 
SOL/USD rose to a peak of $33.30 during today’s session, after falling to a low at $30.80 on Thursday.
 
Earlier gains have since faded, with the world’s seventh largest cryptocurrency now trading at $32.37.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the 14-day RSI is marginally above a floor at 74.00, with a current reading of 74.43.
 
Should bulls sustain this level, there is a good chance that solana could make another run towards $35.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin slipped below the $34,000 level earlier in today’s session, ahead of the upcoming consumer sentiment report in the United States. Data on Thursday showed that the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 4.9% in Q3, largely driven by consumer spending. Ethereum moved below the $1,800 level to start the day.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin slipped below the $34,000 mark on Friday, as markets consolidated ahead of U.S. consumer sentiment figures.
 
BTC/USD fell to a low at $33,762.32 earlier in today’s session, which comes following a peak at $34,649.40 the day before.
 
As a result of the decline, bitcoin continued to pull away from a recent 18-month high, as bears began to gradually seize market sentiment.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This comes as the relative strength index (RSI) remained in overbought territory, with a current reading of 83.68.
 
Bulls in the market seem reluctant to let go of their positions, and have gone on to once again push BTC above $34,000.
 
Overall, BTC remains nearly 15% higher than at the same time last week, despite the recent price consolidation.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also edged lower in today’s session, falling below the $1,800 mark in the process.
 
After reaching a high of $1,857.81 on Thursday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,764.01 earlier in the day.
 
This decline has seen ETH snap a seven-day bull run, pushing the cryptocurrency away from a multi-month high in the process.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
The drop coincided with the RSI failing to breach a resistance level of 74.00, and it is now tracking at a reading of 71.13.
 
Traders who are holding onto their long positions may begin to reconsider this, should the index fall below the 70.00 mark.
