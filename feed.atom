Why Dogecoin Does Not Need An ETF
 
The popular Dogecoin enthusiast recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to outline an extensive list of why Dogecoin, a meme-based cryptocurrency would succeed without joining the ETF hype. 
 
 
According to the crypto expert, Dogecoin’s inherent status as a meme coin would significantly deter it from being completely acknowledged by renowned financial institutions. As a result, the possibility of the cryptocurrency becoming an ETF is unlikely.
 
Additionally, if Dogecoin maintains its value as a digital currency rat…]]></summary>

USDC Temporarily Depegs on Binance Amidst Crypto Market Sell-Off
 
In a surprising move that startled the cryptocurrency market, Circle’s USDC dollar-pegged stablecoin momentarily depegged from its $1 value, falling as low as $0.76 on the Binance exchange platform. This incident occurred during a market-wide sell-off, which was spurred by skepticism over the potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF this month. Notably, USDC experienced three distinct price drops against its tether (USDT) trading pair on Binance between 12:10 and 12:21 UTC, hitting lows of $0.76, $0.803, and $0.8…]]></summary>

Data sourced from CryptoSlam reveals that sales of Bitcoin NFTs experienced an unprecedented surge, reaching an all-time high of over $880 million in December alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the lawsuit between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance, the regulator has filed a notice of supplemental authority, citing the judgment in SEC v. Terraform Labs as a key precedent. This move is a strategic effort by the SEC to leverage the Terra ruling in its case against Binance, Binance.US, and former CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao.
 
SEC Modifies Legal Strategy Against Binance
 
The SEC’s argument hinges on the Terra case’s interpretation of the “investment contract” definition within the context of cryptocurrency offerings. The SEC posits that the court’s application of the Howey Test to classify UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR as investment contracts, and therefore as securities, is directly relevant to the products and services offered by the exchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Andrea Lerdo, a director at the art-supporting organization, Palm Foundation, Web3 enables creators and artists to not only exercise control over their content but to connect with their respective audiences in a way not possible on traditional platforms. For artists who have already carved out a niche in the Web2 space, “Web3 offers something Web2 can’t – true ownership.”
 
Barriers Blocking Creators From Entering Web3
 
Lerdo, however, acknowledged that many small creators seeking to unshackle themselves from the “constraints of algorithms and opaque platform policies” by venturing into Web3 might encounter significant challenges. For instance, artists attempting to dabble with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) may be overwhelmed by the tech’s complexity or the initial costs.

This comes as allegations of market manipulation from the firm continue to resound through the crypto community. 
 
Bitcoin Crash Due To Heightened Expectations
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Jihan Wu suggested that the significant decline in Bitcoin’s price was due to the “market’s volatility spurred by expectations surrounding” the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin’s price dumped by close to 10% on January 3, bringing the broader crypto market down in the process.
 
 
Data from Coinglass also shows that close to $700 million worth of positions in the market have been liquidated since then. Interestingly, the market …]]></summary>

This move by the country’s top financial regulator targets a loophole that has allowed Korean citizens to circumvent existing regulations limiting cryptocurrency purchases using traditional credit cards.
 
 
The proposed amendment, if implemented, would further tighten South Korea’s grip on the burgeoning crypto market, raising questions about its potential impact on individual financial freedom and the broader adoption of digital assets within the country.
