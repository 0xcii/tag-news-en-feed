Coinbase, which offers both Bitcoin custody and Bitcoin brokerage products, has emerged as the proposed custodian for the Bitcoin assets of several ETF applicants. Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo, recently raised concerns about Coinbase's dual role as an exchange and custodian. Although his position is clearly aligned with his self-interest, since BitGo is a custodian that does not operate an exchange, Belshe warned that Coinbase’s dual role might lead to the SEC rejecting those applications.

DOGE Founder Calls Out Senator’s Anti-Crypto Stance
 
Speaking on Squawk Newsmaker, Warren publicly declared her anti-crypto stance, citing potential threats of the exploitation of digital currencies for nefarious purposes.
 
“There’s a new threat out there, it’s crypto and it is being used for terrorist financing. It is being used for drug trafficking. North Korea is using it to pay for about half of its nuclear weapons program. We can’t allow that to continue,” Warren stated.
