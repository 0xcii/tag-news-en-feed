        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase has received a regulatory stamp of approval to start offering perpetual futures trading to retail crypto traders outside the U.S., opening up access to the $5.5 trillion global derivatives market.
 
Coinbase Extends Perpetual Futures Trading to Retail Traders Abroad
 
The Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) granted Coinbase International Exchange, the company’s new non-U.S. exchange, a license last week to extend its futures trading services to retail investors across the world, except residents in the U.S. With the approval, Coinbase is poised to expand its derivatives services to more customers globally through its Coinbase Advanced platform in the coming weeks.
 
“As the most trusted and safest name in crypto, Coinbase will operate with maximum transparency, employ a robust risk framework, and meet the high-bar regulatory and compliance standards of the BMA,” the Coinbase announcement said.
 
The company sees regulatory approval as an opportunity to further its mission of updating the global financial system by providing users around the world with more access to regulated derivatives. The announcement discloses that Coinbase will follow rigorous risk management and compliance standards set by Bermuda regulators.
 
 
The move comes as other exchanges face increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States by regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase said its futures contracts have already seen over $5.5 billion in notional trading volume since launching earlier this year.
 
The San Francisco-based company said its futures trading services will only be available to eligible retail investors outside the U.S. after passing the company’s assessment checks. Coinbase said its futures accounts will be backed by usd coin (USDC) reserves and managed by an experienced risk team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the Co-Founders of Gemini, are under scrutiny over alleged  
secret withdrawal of $282 million from the now-bankrupt crypto lender, Genesis.  
This withdrawal occurred just months before the entire crypto firm collapsed,  
according to a report by the New York Post.
  
  
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been grappling with a  
series of setbacks in recent times, including layoffs and plummeting trading  
volumes at Gemini. However, the focus changed when over $900 million in Gemini  
customer deposits were frozen due to the collapse of Genesis, the crypto  
lending platform that facilitated Gemini Earn, an interest-bearing program.

During his speech on Finance and Taxation at a Congress hearing, Campos Neto said virtual assets brokerages should be subject to strict supervision. 
 
Given Brazil’s significant increase in crypto adoption, the governor emphasized the need to heighten scrutiny on crypto and related activities.
 
Crypto Adoption Increased By 44% 
 
Brazil has witnessed increased adoption amid a high inflation rate. This could be because most people have resorted to digital assets to hedge against inflation and evade tax. Moreover, many believe demand has shifted from fiat currency to stablecoins–cryptocurrencies pegged to USD and other real-world assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu snapped a recent four-day losing streak on Thursday, as bulls rejected a breakout below a key level of support. The slight rebound in price came as the global crypto market cap was marginally higher, climbing 0.25% as of writing. Dogecoin was also in the green.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) ended a four-day losing streak on Thursday, as crypto bulls returned following a slight stalemate earlier in the day.
 
Following a low of $0.000007164 on Thursday, SHIB/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.000007287 during today’s session.
 
This came as traders continued to move price away from a recent support point around the $0.00000710 level.
 
 
From the chart, it also appears that momentum is somewhat bullish, with the 10-day (red) moving average nearing a cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In order for this to happen, the relative strength index (RSI) will first need to rise beyond a ceiling at the 44.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 42.14, with SHIB trading at $0.000007256.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) also ended a winless run on Thursday, as the meme coin rallied following two days of declines.
 
DOGE/USD peaked at $0.06117 earlier in the day, which comes after a low of $0.06027 the day prior.
 
Similar to shiba inu, the moves comes as DOGE bounced away from a recent price floor at the $0.0600 level.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it seems as though the next target will be around the $0.0625 zone, which was last hit exactly a week ago.
 
In order to reach this point, price strength will need to climb from a current reading at 42.52, and head closer to a ceiling of 44.00.
