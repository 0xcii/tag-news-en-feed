Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Has Been Positive Alongside Latest Rally
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Coinbase Premium Gap, which had negative values just earlier, has switched back to positive recently.
 
 
The “Coinbase Premium Gap” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).

Bitcoin is an electronic peer-to-peer cash system that is working, but the world we've built around it is incredibly alienated and disconnected from the rest of society. We've been effectively siloed, and anyone who thinks this will help adoption is dreaming. I think the room stinks and that this little Bitcoin world isn't working for Bitcoin.

This move comes after claims of theft and money laundering, showing how hard it is to regulate digital currencies.
 
 
Tether And The ‘Pig Butchering’ Trap 
 
Elliptic, a company that studies blockchains, says that Huione Group has been involved in “pig-butchering” scams. This is a type of scam in which scammers get people to trust them before getting them to invest in fake schemes. People say that the company is involved in illegal deals worth about $11 billion and mostly uses Tether’s USDT stablecoin to do business through Telegram.
