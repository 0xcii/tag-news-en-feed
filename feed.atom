Trading Volume Rising Hours After Crypto Flash Crash
 
Notably, the sharp uptick in trading volume comes despite unverified concerns that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might not, after all, approve any Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in January 2023.
 
 
Despite the lack of ETF approval, the crypto community remains bullish, with Bitcoin and top assets stable and arresting sharp losses of January 3. When writing, Bitcoin prices are steady, rejecting lower lows.

These securities, backed by the largest cryptocurrency in the market, are being positioned as an alternative to spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that require approval from US regulators. 
 
The startup behind this initiative, Receipts Depositary Corporation (RDC), plans to issue the first Bitcoin depositary receipts to qualified global institutional investors, providing them a convenient and regulated way to gain exposure to BTC.
