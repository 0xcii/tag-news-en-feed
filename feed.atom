The recent regulatory clampdown on Binance and Coinbase has evoked a lot of issues in the crypto industry. After the SEC announced the lawsuit against Binance, the exchange saw net outflows amounting to $778 million in 24 hours. Also, on-chain analyst CryptoQuant revealed that withdrawals on Binance spiked following the announcement. 
 
While the industry still reels from the US SEC’s actions against the two top crypto firms, its Chair, Gary Gensler, declared that the country doesn’t need more crypto assets.
