        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Spencer Nichols, Product Marketing Associate at Bitcoin Magazine and host of The Cosmic Bitcoin Podcast.
Folk music artist Oliver Anthony took the internet by storm with a video of his song “Rich Men North of Richmond,” recorded in the woods near his off-grid home in Virginia, and has created something resembling the Bitcoin song of the year. Anthony’s raw emotion and lamentation of the “new world” along with his observation that “the dollar ain’t shit” has certainly aided him in receiving accolades from the Bitcoin community.
It’s of course no coincidence that Bitcoiners gravitated toward this song given its criticism of “rich men North of Richmond” — glares at the Washington uni-party — but what I find most important is Anthony’s cathartic, grieving tone. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was one of Saturday’s notable gainers, as price rebounded from recent lows to start the weekend. Today’s rebound comes as the global crypto market cap moved into the green earlier in the session. XRP was also higher on Saturday.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) moved away from a recent support point to start the weekend, as bulls opted to buy a recent dip in price.
 
Following a low of $0.000008016 on Friday, SHIB/USD rose to an intraday peak of $0.00000822 on Saturday.
 
As a result, shiba inu moved away from the aforementioned price floor around the $0.00000790 zone.
 
 
The bounce comes as the relative strength index (RSI) also avoided a support of its own at 39.00, and has now jumped to a reading of 43.27.
 
A ceiling of 47.00 now awaits traders in the event that bullish momentum intensifies during the weekend.
 
 
XRP
 
Additionally, XRP was also in the green, rebounding from recent losses of its own.
 
XRP/USD rose to a high of $0.5298 to start the weekend, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $0.5128.
 
Similar to shiba inu above, the rise in price sees the meme coin attempt to move beyond a recent floor at $0.5045.
 
 
Earlier gains have somewhat eased, however, as the RSI collided with a resistance level of 35.00, with price falling to a current reading of $0.5235.
 
In the event that this ceiling is broken, bulls will most likely be targeting exits around the $0.5435 zone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been speculations that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could drag Ripple Labs’ founders into the regulator’s long-running legal battle against their company. However, pro-XRP legal expert Fred Rispoli has outlined why this is unlikely.
 
SEC Unlikely To Sue Ripple Founders
 
Rispoli stated in a tweet that the SEC is unlikely to pursue a trial against Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen for “many reasons.” 
 
 
 
 
The agency had accused Ripple Labs of selling unregistered securities back in 2020. But although it highlighted Garlinghouse and Larsen as integral to the wrongdoing, it never brought an action specifically against the duo.
 
It is not unusual for the SEC to bring actions against top executives whenever it files a suit aga…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin remained largely unchanged on Saturday, as markets were mostly unmoved by comments from the Federal Reserve’s chair, Jerome Powell. Speaking at the annual Jackson Hole symposium, Powell hinted that more hikes were in the cards. Ethereum moved back towards a recent support point.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin continued to trade near the $26,000 region to start the weekend, as markets failed to react to Jerome Powell’s comments at the Jackson Hole symposium.
 
Powell stated that, “We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $25,914.93 on the comments, following Friday’s high at $26,406.15.
 
 
Price has since moved back above $26,000, as the relative strength index (RSI) began to trend sideways.
 
As of writing, price strength is now tracking at 25.71, which is closer to a ceiling of 29.00 than a floor of 20.00.
 
Should the index move beyond the 29.00 level, there could be more bulls reentering the market.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) edged lower on Saturday, as traders were underwhelmed by yesterday’s speech by the Fed chair.
 
Following a peak at $1,665.14 during yesterday’s session, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,641.63 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the decline, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moved below a support point of $1,650.
 
 
This week has seen ETH mostly trade between a low of $1,580 and a high of $1,690, with some occasional breakouts.
 
For bulls, a surge will need to occur at the resistance level of 33.00 on the RSI, in order for momentum to truly shift upward.

This spike in trading activity has been linked to the release of the former United States president’s mugshot and his interview with a former Fox News host, Tucker Carlson.
 
On Thursday, August 24, Donald Trump’s mugshot was taken and circulated after he turned himself in at the Fulton County Sheriff’s office as part of his criminal case in Georgia for allegedly trying to manipulate the will of voters in the 2020 election.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. The cryptocurrency market lacks regulation, leading to potential risks for investors, including SIM-swap scams. By this technique, hackers manipulate mobile carrier customer service to gain access to a user’s phone number, allowing them to bypass security measures and access accounts. Bart Stephens, co-founder of Blockchain Capital, fell victim to a SIM-swap attack, resulting in a $6.3 million Bitcoin theft. He has filed a lawsuit against the hackers. From all this it’s clear there’s a lack of effective safeguards and timely notifications from mobile phone carriers. Jellyfish Mobile provides a solution to prevent SIM-swap attacks and other vulnerabilities arising from cell phone carriers’ negligence.
