        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the year draws to a close, significant developments are emerging from the fallout of the defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, once led by convicted founder Sam Bankman-Fried. After months of anticipation, there are signs that payouts to FTX customers affected by the exchange’s collapse two years ago are finally on the horizon.
 
$16 Billion In Cash Set For Distribution
 
Market expert MartyParty recently highlighted this progress, referring to “actual evidence from actual FTX customers on actual intentions.” 
 
 
In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), one user shared their experience, stating they had managed to withdraw most of their assets before FTX’s bankruptcy, leaving only a “small amount of Chainlink” in the exchange.

Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Has Registered A Notable Increase Recently
 
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC Open Interest on Binance has risen to $28.3 billion recently. The “Open Interest” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin-related positions currently open on a given platform.
 
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the exchange right now. Generally, more positions imply more leverage in the market, so this trend can lead to more volatility in the asset’s price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a recent report from Bloomberg, crypto assets and US stocks are increasingly moving in tandem, reflecting a significant correlation that has not been seen in recent months. This correlation suggests that the macroeconomic factors influencing equity markets also shape the digital asset landscape.
 
Correlation Between Digital Assets And S&P 500
 
Per the report, the 40-day correlation coefficient for a gauge of the largest 100 digital assets and the S&P 500 Index currently stands at approximately 0.67. This level of correlation has only been surpassed once, during the second quarter of 2022 when it peaked at 0.72. 
 
In this context, a coefficient of 1 indicates that the assets are moving in perfect synchrony, while a reading of -1 suggests an inverse relationship.

Clearer Stance Toward Digital Assets Expected From Harris
 
In a memo shared with clients on September 23, 2024, analysts at Bernstein highlighted several reasons for the brief rally witnessed in digital assets over the weekend. 
 
One of the reasons is the prospect of bipartisan support for the crypto-economy. At a Wall Street fundraiser over the weekend, Harris remarked that her regime will “encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors.”
 
 
Notably, this was the first time Harris used the word digital assets in her speeches. Bernstein analysts wrote:
