        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Terraform Labs co-founder Kwon Do-hyung, commonly known as Do Kwon, has mounted a legal challenge against his extradition, as confirmed by the Montenegrin Court of Appeal on December 6. This appeal, first reported by Korean news outlet Digital Asset, follows the High Court of Podgorica’s decision to extradite Kwon, once one of the most influential figures in the crypto space, to either South Korea or the United States.
 
The appeal, lodged just two weeks after the High Court’s extradition approval, introduces significant uncertainty into the proceedings.

The legal battle that culminated in this seizure started on May 2, 2023 when Whinstone US, Inc., a subsidiary of Riot Platforms, filed a lawsuit against certain Rhodium entities. The dispute centered around hosting and energy agreements between the two parties, with Whinstone seeking damages for alleged unpaid hosting fees and a declaratory judgment asserting its right to terminate these agreements.

Why Crypto Will Come “Crashing Down”
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Stark suggested that crypto prices will come “crashing down” because these crypto tokens do not have “inherent value.” He opined that cryptocurrencies derived their value from hype as “people are able to sell hyped, FOMO’d and overpriced crypto to a “greater fool.”
