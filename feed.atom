Layer-1 Tokens Like Solana Leads The Performance Chart
 
Taking to X on December 13, Thor Hartvigsen, a data-driven decentralized finance (defi) researcher, noted that layer-1 coins under observation, like AVAX and SOL, are, on average, up 50% in the past month.

Closed-Door Discussions Reveal Montenegro’s Plan For Do Kwon
 
Initially set to be extradited to the US on December 15, Do Kwon’s fate turned when the Montenegrin High Court ruled to prolong his stay until February 15, 2024. 
 
The decision stems from charges related to the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, which led to significant financial losses.
 
The High Court had previously ordered Kwon’s extradition by Friday, but his defense team appealed the decision in the appellate court in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro.
