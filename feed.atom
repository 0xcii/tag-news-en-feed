        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency landscape is experiencing a fascinating shift, with Litecoin unexpectedly emerging as a star player in the realm of real-world transactions.
 
While Bitcoin (BTC) continues to shatter price records, LTC is quietly swiping the spotlight on BitPay, a leading crypto payment processor.
 
 
Litecoin: The Unlikely Challenger Takes The Crown 
The crypto has surged to an all-time high (ATH) of 40% dominance as a payment option on BitPay. This dethrones the long-reigning champion, Bitcoin, which currently sits at a distant 24%, according to BitPay’s data.
 
This 40% dominance figure represents a significant milestone for the altcoin, showcasing a growing preference for it as a means of payment. Potential factors driving this shift include Litecoin’s faster transaction times and l…]]></summary>

Its price has skyrocketed by almost 60% in the past month, reaching near $4,000 – a level unseen since December 2021. This surge in value has been accompanied by a surge in another key metric: transaction fees.
 
 
Ethereum Network Feeling The Heat Of Increased Demand
 
The Ethereum network is like a busy highway. The more users trying to get on (transactions), the slower things move (processing times), and the more expensive it becomes to use the highway (transaction fees).
 
Since early March, Ether has seen a dramatic increase in transaction volume, with a single day recording a staggering $50 billion – the highest level since 2022. This surge in activity has pushed transaction fees to a …]]></summary>

According to Bloomberg, this resurgence in the bond’s value mirrors a broader resurgence in the appetite for convertible bonds, particularly in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, where some firms have successfully issued bonds with no coupon.
