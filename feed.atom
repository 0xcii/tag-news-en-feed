        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bitcoin-owning Swedish couple was recently the latest victim of robbers that appear to target prominent bitcoin and crypto personalities. One social media user said the spate of robberies may be linked to Sweden’s antiquated privacy laws which make it easy for criminals to obtain tax records and residence details of targeted individuals.
 
Victims Publicly Associated With Bitcoin
 
The robbers, who appear to target prominent Swedish bitcoin and crypto personalities, recently descended on the Stockholm residence of a middle-aged bitcoin-owning couple. According to a report in Aftonbladet, the four robbers physically assaulted, tied up, and even used knives to threaten the couple. The report added that one victim of the robbery had to be ferried to the hospital via ambulance helicopter.

Aurelien Michel, a French citizen and the brains behind the Mutant Ape Planet nonfungible token (NFT) collection, has entered a plea of guilt on charges of wire fraud in a New York court, reports disclose Wednesday, referencing the statement from the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York.
 
Michel’s creation, the Mutant Ape Planet collection, proved to be an illicit mimicry of Yuga Labs’ Mutant Ape Yacht Club initiative. Michel orchestrated a scheme that swindled investors out of a staggering $3 million in connection with the fraudulent collection.
