The trend will likely continue, looking at the price and volume ratios of Ethereum and Bitcoin in recent days. A clear divergence shows that Bitcoin could be extending its lead over Ethereum, reinforcing Kaiko’s findings.
 
 
The Ethereum Merge: Shift To Proof-of-Stake
 
Ethereum is now a proof-of-stake network where validators, not miners, confirm transactions and secure it. Before the Merge, Ethereum was a proof-of-work blockchain reliant on miners. In late 2020, Ethereum operated on two networks in parallel, with the current PoS platfo…]]></summary>

SBF Lawyers Into The Loan’s Legalities
 
Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the now-defunct FTX exchange, seems to be in a tangle over the loans given out by Alameda Research. Lawyers on his team are eager to question Gary Wang about the details and the legal counsels involved in the loans he received from the trading firm.
 
 
Last week, during the trial, the prosecutors delved deep into Wang’s financial activities. They pointedly asked about what they described as “a series of personal loans” that ranged from roughly $200-$300 million. 
 
These loans were notable as they were issued to Wang from Alam…]]></summary>
