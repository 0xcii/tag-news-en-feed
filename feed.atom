        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the report revealing that the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex had received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the securities regulator charged Bittrex and the company’s CEO on April 17 for “operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency.”
 
Following the Wells Notice, SEC Charges Bittrex for Violating Federal Laws
 
On Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged another cryptocurrency exchange, accusing the trading platform Bittrex of operating “an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.” Since 2014, Bittrex allegedly sold crypto assets that were “offered and sold as securities.” The SEC’s complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-jumps-6-avax-hits-2-month-high-on-monday/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-17T15:52:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin rose by over 6% to start the week, as prices moved back towards a key resistance level. The meme coin moved higher for a fifth straight session, despite the cryptocurrency market falling by 1.54% as of writing. Avalanche also climbed, hitting a two-month high.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) rose by as much as 6% on Monday, as prices surged for a fifth consecutive session.
 
Following a low of $0.08858 on Sunday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.0946 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw dogecoin close in on a key resistance at the $0.0960 level, which was last hit on April 5.
 
 
Looking at the chart, one of the catalysts of today’s surge in price was a breakout that occurred on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, price strength has moved beyond a ceiling at the 61.00 mark, and is tracking at 62.87
 
An upcoming wall at 65.00 could be a hurdle for current bulls. However, should they overcome this, there is a good chance that DOGE moves back above $0.1000.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
In addition to DOGE, avalanche (AVAX), was another notable gainer in the market to start the week.
 
AVAX/USD climbed to an intraday high of $21.011 on Monday, following a low of $19.04 during Sunday’s session.
 
As a result of Monday’s surge in price, avalanche has hit its highest point since Feb. 22.
 
 
This has resulted in the token briefly breaking out of a point of resistance at $20.90, however gains have since slipped.
 
It appears that momentum was caught short following the RSI colliding with its own ceiling at the 73.00 mark.
 
Although the index is now tracking at 73.17, earlier bulls seem to be more tentative, and are moving to secure gains.

Did The Fallen Crypto Giant Knew About The Crash?
 
TerraLabs, founded by Kwon, is a blockchain ecosystem that included a stablecoin token called TerraUSD, and a sister token called Luna, which suffered a significant collapse in May 2022. The collapse wiped out over $50 billion in market capitalization of UST/LUNA and caused over $400 billion in losses for the broader cryptocurrency market.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-moves-below-30000-on-monday-as-us-dollar-rallies/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-17T12:40:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week trading below $30,000, as the U.S. dollar strengthened during Monday’s session. USD/JPY rose to a one-month high, with the greenback also gaining against the euro and British pound. Ethereum was also lower, falling below $2,100.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $30,000 mark on Monday, as a strong U.S. dollar weakened cryptocurrency markets.
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $29,816.72, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $30,555.54.
 
Monday’s price slippage comes two days after bitcoin rose above $31,000 for the first time since June 7.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Ultimately, this recent bull run pushed BTC into overbought territory, with the relative strength index (RSI) hitting a ceiling of 71.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 63.45, with a floor at the 59.00 mark potentially approaching.
 
Should price strength continue to move towards this level, there is a good chance that BTC will move below a floor at $29,600.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) mostly consolidated to start the week, as price moved below the $2,100 mark on Monday.
 
Following a high of $2,137.45 on Sunday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $2,076.18 earlier in today’s session.
 
Monday’s decline sees the world’s second largest cryptocurrency drop from a recent 11-month high.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Similar to bitcoin, this decline coincided with the 14-day RSI failing to break out of a ceiling, and in this instance it was at the 75.00 mark.
 
Despite this, ETH remains close to the $2,100 mark, helped by the fact the index is still above its floor at 69.00
 
If this point of support were to break, then bears would likely reenter the market.
