        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano fell by over 25% on Saturday, as traders continued to react to the token being delisted from the Robinhood platform. The global cryptocurrency market cap is currently down by nearly 6%, following these developments. Polygon, which was also delisted, dropped to a one-year low to start the weekend.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) dropped markedly on Saturday, as traders continued to react to the token being delisted from the Robinhood platform.
 
Following a high of $0.3218 on Friday, ADA/USD slipped to a bottom at $0.2304 to start the weekend.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) plunged below a floor at the 30.00 mark, entering oversold territory.
 
At the time of writing, the index is currently tracking at 17.75.
 
ADA is currently trading at $0.2509, down 22% from yesterday’s peak.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Additionally, polygon (MATIC) lost a significant amount of its value to start the weekend, nearing a one-year low in the process.
 
MATIC/USD sank to a bottom at $0.5605 on Saturday, as prices dropped by nearly 30% from yesterday’s high.
 
As a result of this decline, the world’s twelfth-largest cryptocurrency moved to its lowest point since last July.
 
 
Overall, the token is now down close to 40% in the last seven-days, after breaking out of a support point at $0.75.
 
This has also led to the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) extending a downwards crossover versus the 25-day (blue) MA.
 
Price strength is also deeply oversold with a reading of 16.22, which is an all-time low point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved below the $26,000 level to start the weekend, as bearish pressure intensified following a week of turbulence. Sentiment in the market once again shifted, as traders liquidated their positions on the back of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) crackdown on crypto. ETH dropped below $1,800.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the weekend trading below $26,000, as traders continued to react to the fallout of the SEC’s cryptocurrency crackdown.
 
The latest domino to fall came in the form of Robinhood, who moved to delist several altcoins from its platform, including solana and cardano.
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $25,502 in the news, which comes a day after price peaked at $26,770.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the latest downturn came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell towards a floor at 39.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking marginally above this point at 40.06.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has extended its downward cross versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart, putting further emphasis on the current bearish sentiment.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Bears were also present in ethereum (ETH), which dropped below the $1,800 level to start the weekend.
 
After climbing to a peak of $1,861.14 on Friday, ETH/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,721 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw ethereum plunge to its weakest point since late April, breaking out of a floor at $1,730 in the process.
 
 
As a result of this shift in market momentum, the RSI also tailed off, dropping to its lowest level since March.
 
The index is currently at a reading below 40.00, which is close to oversold territory, and could act as a slight positive for bulls.
 
In the event price becomes more oversold, there is a good chance that longer term bulls could move to buy the dip.

In a blog post recently shared by the Ethereum co-founder himself, Buterin highlights the imperative need for three pivotal transitions that Ethereum must undergo in order to ensure its prosperous future. 
 
These transitions, aptly dubbed “The Three Transitions,” revolve around the realms of Layer-2 scaling solutions, the implementation of smart contract wallets, and the augmentation of privacy in fund transfers. 
 
Without embracing these transformative changes, Buterin says Ethereum risks hindering its own expansion and jeopardizing its position as a frontrunner in the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized technologies.
