According to a report by Bloomberg, U.S. prosecutors in New York – specifically, the city of  Brooklyn  – are assessing the internal transfers between the multibillion-dollar crypto conglomerate and its crypto lending arm, Genesis Global Capital. 
 
The crypto lending company has been in the spotlight for a long time following its heavy losses last year. 
 
Based on anonymous sources that are close to the investigation, the federal prosecutors are already conducting interviews with certain personnel and requesting office documents.

While expressing his thoughts in a speech he made in Paris on January 5, the governor of the Bank of France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, pointed toward the ongoing market volatility as a reason and pushed to implement an obligatory licensing system “as soon as possible.”
 
The recent FTX bankruptcy in November of last year worsened the situation in the crypto industry. Alongside changing investors’ views on virtual assets, the unrest in the crypto market caused by the exchange’s collapse led many countries to apply stricter regulations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin, following the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, continues to struggle not only in terms of its trading price but also in its profitability.
 
It can be recalled that the company, back in November 2022, moved to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a U.S. county court, and collapsed in just a matter of days.
 
Bitcoin, being the main driving force of the crypto market, was greatly affected by this unfortunate development and eventually exited 2022 with a value that was significantly lesser than what it had back in 2021.
 
According to BTC data aggregator Statmuse, the maiden digital coin had an average price of $47,500 in 2021 but it closed last year with a median value of $28,171, losing 64.3% of its price for the year.
