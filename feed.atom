While long-term and modest forecasts expect silver to hit $30 by 2025 and $40 by 2027, Keith Neumeyer, CEO of First Majestic Silver, thinks medium to long-term, silver could reach $125 per ounce, thanks to the automobile industry.
 
Keith Neumeyer Highlights Silver’s Role in the Growing Demand for Renewable Energy and Electric Vehicles
 
The precious metal silver is down more than 12% against the U.S. dollar since mid-January when it reached $24 per troy ounce. Still, six-month statistics show an ounce of silver is 14% higher than it was on September 6, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The development kit is envisioned as having multiple components that would enable increase the accessibility and openness of bitcoin mining hardware.
Jack Dorsey’s Block has posted a new blog that details the Mining Development Kit, a new project that would seemingly replicate the Lightning Development Kit and Bitcoin Development Kit projects, providing developers access to bitcoin mining projects focused on integrating bitcoin mining into various novel use cases.
The blog describes how the company has started developing their own bitcoin mining semiconductor chips, saying that “These purpose-built application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are the leading way bitcoin is mined today and will serve as the foundation for a full suite of bitcoin mining products intended to increase the pace of innovation in bitcoin mining.” 
Block then says it is considering building the MDK, and they are seeking further feedback from the community. The MDK as Block “currently envisions it” would have four components:

A “powerful, reliable, industrial-grade” bitcoin mining hashboard.
A custom controller board designed to work with the hashboard.
Open-source firmware, a software API and a web front-end, that would allow developers to modify the key performance parameters of the hashboard.
And extensive reference materials and support documentation “to facilitate easy customization of the hashboard.”

“The intention behind the MDK is to provide developers with a suite of tools to help unlock creativity and innovation in bitcoin mining hardware,” describes the blog. “With the MDK, we see a significant opportunity to increase the accessibility and openness of bitcoin mining hardware, in order to accelerate innovation in the field.”
The post ends with a promise of future updates in the coming weeks and months, and a call to action for feedback that can be directed to mining@block.xyz.]]></summary>

But certain firms are still thriving amid the current state of the market. A notable example is Argo, a popular UK-based Bitcoin mining company. Argo Blockchain is one of the leading cryptocurrency mining companies in North America and Europe.
 
Argo Increases Bitcoin Production

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DC Circuit judges hammered the SEC’s lawyers as they defended their decision to not approve Grayscale’s move toward a spot bitcoin ETF.
Grayscale Investments LLC participated in oral arguments on Tuesday in the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in relation to its attempts to get its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) converted to a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). In these oral arguments, the three presiding judges seemingly sided with Grayscale in their positioning.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly denied previous attempts at the introduction of a spot bitcoin ETF. This has led to Grayscale suing the SEC, alleging that the decisions have been arbitrary and inconsistent with the Commission's decision to approve Bitcoin futures ETFs. 
In today’s arguments, presiding judges Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan and Judge Neomi Rao continually prodded the SEC Senior Counsel Emily Parise about the SEC’s differentiation between a futures ETF and a spot bitcoin ETF. 
“[The prices] move together 99.9% of the time. So where's the gap, in the Commission's view?” asked Judge Rao. 
The SEC response was that correlation does not equal causation, with its lawyers explaining that the key empirical question is whether fraud and manipulation in the spot markets affect futures in the same way so that they can rely on the surveillance of the future markets. Without that missing empirical piece, the SEC counsel said, the agency can't be sure it can rely on CME future surveillance to approve a spot ETF. 
Questioning led to the pontification that the SEC had not provided sufficient evidence to explain their decision making, with Judge Rao telling Parise, “The SEC has not offered any explanation that the petitioners are wrong.”
The full record of the questioning can be listened to here.]]></summary>
