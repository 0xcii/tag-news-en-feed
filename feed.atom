        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A big change is brewing up in the world of Bitcoin. Over time, US-based ETFs will become the largest holders of Bitcoin, surpassing even Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious founder of the cryptocurrency. This development certainly also captures how institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space is growing.
 
 
Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas surprised the crypto community with a farfetched prediction in relation to Bitcoin ownership. Balchunas claims that if trends continue, by the end of this year, the world’s most elusive man, Satoshi Nakamoto, will not be holding the largest share of the cryptocurrency. This prediction assumes a dramatic change within the ownership landscape of Bitcoin, with institutional actors gaining ground very fast.

BTC’s Liquidity Fragmentation
 
Kaiko analysts noted in the report that liquidity fragmentation continues to persist for the flagship crypto, leading to price discrepancies across exchanges. Simply put, liquidity fragmentation refers to when liquidity is unevenly distributed across these exchanges, leading to unstable prices, especially among less liquid exchanges. 
 
 
Although this liquidity fragmentation has reduced for Bitcoin over time, the research firm noted that it was very apparent during last week’s sell-off, which led to the flagship crypto dropping below $50,000 fo…]]></summary>
