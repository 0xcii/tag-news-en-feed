        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ukraine’s governmental data reveals a notable shortfall in the national budget of over $80 million during the past 10 years because of the non-compliance of cryptocurrency exchanges operating within the country. 
 
The Bureau of Economic Security (BEB) of Ukraine recently notified that these unrelated crypto exchanges have led to the loss of at least 3 billion hryvnia in tax revenue, roughly $80 million, spanning from 2013 to 2023. 
 
An in-depth examination conducted by the BEB highlighted that trades involving significant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Tether (USDT) amassed a collective trading volume exceeding $55 billion on Ukrainian-based exchanges between 2013 and 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was one of Friday’s biggest movers, as markets reacted to the news that Binance had approved the meme coin as a collateralized asset. The cryptocurrency exchange confirmed that it was adding 22 new loanable and collateral assets to its Flexible and VIP Loan services. Solana was another notable gainer on Friday.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) rose by over 5% on Friday, on the news that  was adding the asset to its Flexible and VIP Loan services.
 
SHIB/USD hit an intraday peak of $0.000008677 on the news, a day after trading at a low of $0.000008226.
 
The move resulted in the meme coin hitting its highest point since Monday, when it peaked at $0.00000872.
 
 
One of the catalysts for the surge also seemed to be a breakout of the 60.00 level on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time time of writing, the index is tracking at 62.20, which is marginally below a higher ceiling of 63.00
 
Earlier gains have already eased, with traders likely securing profits in anticipation of a collision with this zone.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Additionally, solana (SOL) returned to the green during today’s session, snapping a two-day losing streak in the process.
 
After falling to a bottom of $22.52 on Thursday, SOL/USD climbed to a high of $23.13 earlier in today’s session.
 
Despite today’s rebound in price, solana is still trading almost 7% lower than at the same point last week.
 
 
The rally began after the RSI bounced from a support level at the 45.00 mark, rising to a current reading of 49.04.
 
Bulls are likely targeting a move back above the $25.00 level, however they will first need to move beyond an upcoming wall of 50.00 on the indicator.

A key contribution to this ongoing conversation comes from Adam Cochran, an esteemed fintech executive and business analyst.
 
Cochran recently released a comprehensive outline, suggesting potential methodologies for launching an algorithmic stablecoin. Cochran’s in-depth exploration of this topic comes in response to Zhao’s concerns about the risks associated with larger stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Binance USD (BUSD).

For traders seeking to harness crypto’s explosive growth while managing its volatility, leveraged trading has emerged as a double-edged sword. Used properly, margin trading allows traders to amplify profits. However, without prudent risk management, it can also dramatically magnify losses. 
 
PrimeXBT, a leading multi-asset margin trading platform, has introduced an adjustable leverage system that provides traders with more control over risk versus reward. But before delving into PrimeXBT’s innovations, it’s important to understand exactly how margin trading works and the inherent benefits and dangers it presents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is trading near a support point of $29,000, ahead of today’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report. It is expected that 200,000 jobs were added to the economy last month, down from 209,000 in June. Ethereum was marginally lower on Friday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated around the $29,000 level on Friday, as traders readied themselves for the upcoming U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.
 
BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $29,375.71 in today’s session, following an earlier low of $29,066.24.
 
Earlier gains have since faded, however, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency now trading at the $29,145.77 mark.

The decline comes as the relative strength index (RSI) fell back towards a support point of 42.00.
 
After hitting a ceiling above 51.00 in recent days, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 43.71.
 
There is still optimism that bulls could reenter the market after today’s report, with the $29,500 level an initial target.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was once again trading below a key support level during today’s session, as price fell for a third straight day.
 
Following a high of $1,856.41 on Thursday, ETH/USD slipped to a bottom at the $1,828.88 mark earlier in the day.
 
The decline saw ethereum drop below a support point at $1,850, with sellers once again attempting to take price under $1,800.

From the chart, the RSI has also dipped, and fallen below a floor at the 45.00 level for the first time in over a month.
 
Currently the index is at a reading of 42.16, with overall sentiment mostly bearish.

This claim surfaced on August 3 and revolved around the alleged replication of code within the zkSync platform, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution driven by zero-knowledge technology. 
 
In blockchain initiatives, it’s common for these projects to share their code through open-source software licenses. This grants external developers the freedom to peruse, replicate, and sometimes even enhance the code as they see fit.
 
Yet, customary practices within the community, alongside most open-source licenses, typically mandate that independent developers give credit whenever they integrate code sourced from elsewhere.
