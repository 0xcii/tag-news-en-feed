These governments include the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, El Salvador, Bhutan, Venezuela, Finland, and Georgia.

This development was first brought to light by Crypto Eri, a prominent member of the XRP community, in a post on X from Monday, citing updates from Crunchbase.
 
Why Are Ripple And Tranglo Parting Ways?
 
Crunchbase’s latest records indicate that Ripple has exited investments in both the Bitstamp exchange and Tranglo. While the firm’s exit from Bitstamp appears aligned with Bitstamp’s acquisition by Robinhood, the divestment from Tranglo comes unexpectedly.
 
Tranglo has been an integral part of Ripple’s strategy to enhance global financial transactions using XRP. By leveraging the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, Tranglo facilitated quicker and cheap…]]></summary>

My first thought, after noting my impeccable timing, was: “Let me see how CNN frames this.”

You may have had a similar thought process like mine, and if you did, you’ll probably agree that the media landscape has changed. 
A lot. 
Influenced by the political leanings of its workforce, the rise of cancel culture, and the need to make money, this shift has majorly impacted how tech and Bitcoin (and pretty much everything else) are viewed.

COPA Vs. Wright Bitcoin Authorship Case
 
Over the years, Craig Wright has faced several legal battles for his attempts to copyright Bitcoin’s whitepaper and claim BTC’s authorship. His claim to be the person behind the pseudonym identity of Satoshi Nakamoto began in 2016 and has been highly contested by the crypto industry and its figures.
