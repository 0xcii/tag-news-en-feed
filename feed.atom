Discussion of mempool or policy (the non-consensus rules around Bitcoin nodes communicating with one another) often falls to the background. However, with recent high transaction volume and launch of various NFT and token projects/platforms and the accompanying feerate spike, mempool and policy came to the forefront.
User of Inscriptions and other protocols ran into issues with standardness policy rules, leading many to question their purpose and look for ways to remove or subvert them. Regular Bitcoin users ran into issues with fees or bumping fees. In an effort to educate and en…]]></summary>

In that now-famous article, penned for The New York Times on September 7, 2011, Krugman criticized and dismissed the cryptocurrency, which was then trading at an average of $7.03 per Bitcoin across exchanges. 
Fast forward to today, and Bitcoin's remarkable journey has proven Krugman's skepticism to be one of the most costly missed opportunities in financial history, as demonstrated by the reaction to an X post today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo.
When Krugman's article was published, Bitcoin was still in its infancy. The digital money, created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, had only been around for a couple of years. It was largely unknown to the mai…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-06T15:34:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was a notable gainer in today’s session, as the cryptocurrency rose for a second straight session. The global market cap is marginally higher at the time of writing, as prices mostly consolidated. Solana retreated from a near one-week high.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was in the green for a second session running, following a bounce from a recent point of support.
 
Price rallied to a peak of $0.000007757 earlier in the day, which comes after Tuesday’s low at $0.0000076.
 
As referenced earlier, the surge occurred after SHIB bears rejected a breakout below a price floor at the $0.00000735 mark.
 
 
This came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also avoided a drop of its own, near support of 35.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 39.07, with the next point of resistance around 43.00.
 
Should bulls manage to push the price closer to the aforementioned zone, there is a good chance SHIB can climb over $0.00000800.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
After trading close to a one-week high earlier in the session, solana (SOL) retreated from this point, falling under $20.00 in the process.
 
SOL/USD moved to a bottom at $19.41 on Wednesday, a day after it hit an intraday high of $20.55.
 
The decline sees solana now on the cusp of colliding with a support point at the $19.00 mark, which has been the floor for the past two months.
 
 
Today’s downtrend came as the RSI was unable to break out of a resistance zone of 44.00, falling to a current reading of 38.97 instead.
 
In the event that momentum remains bearish in the coming days, a target of 36.00 could act as a level of stability.

        <updated>2023-09-06T14:57:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a new interview with Bloomberg, Steven McClurg, the CIO of Valkyrie Investments, predicts that a Bitcoin spot ETF could become a reality by Q1 2024, potentially marking a significant milestone for the crypto industry. 
Further, he indicated there is a "50%" chance a Bitcoin ETF is approved in October, the earliest that such a fund could pass evaluation by the SEC.

Elsewhere, the discussion revolved around the ongoing efforts by several financial institutions and asset managers to launch a Bitcoin ETF in the United States. While Canada and other countries have already embraced crypto ETFs, the U.S. has been slower to approve such products, primarily due to regulatory concerns.
McClurg believes that the growing acceptance and understanding of cryptocurrencies among regulators and institutional investors will pave the way for a Bitcoin spot ETF in the near future. He points out that the SEC has been actively engaging with the crypto industry to establish clear guidelines for these financial products.
The potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF could open doors for a broader range of investors to gain exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. 
Currently, U.S. investors can access Bitcoin through various investment trusts and futures contracts, but a spot ETF would provide a more direct and convenient investment vehicle. 
McClurg predicted that the market for Bitcoin could "10x" on the back of institutional investment from pension funds and other professional money managers.
The interview also touched on the broader implications of a Bitcoin spot ETF. It could potentially attract more institutional money into the market, driving liquidity. 
However, McClurg acknowledges that regulatory hurdles must be cleared before a Bitcoin spot ETF can become a reality. The SEC has expressed concerns about market manipulation, custody solutions, and investor protection. 
Valkyrie is one of over 10 firms that have currently filed with the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF.]]></summary>
