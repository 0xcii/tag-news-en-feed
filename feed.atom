        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week mostly flat, as market volatility remained near recent lows during today’s session. Traders appear to be on the sidelines ahead of Wednesday’s key inflation report from the United States. Ethereum mostly consolidated on Monday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to hover near the $29,000 level to start the week, as market volatility was mostly muted on Monday.
 
After Sunday’s low at $28,963.83, BTC/USD jumped to a high of $29,166.82 earlier in today’s session.
 
The world’s largest cryptocurrency has mostly been trading between a support level of $28,800, and a resistance of $29,500 for the majority of the last week.

Looking at the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) is also tracking near a floor of its own around the 42.00 mark.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has begun to flatline following a downtrend, which is a sign of price stagnation.
 
Consolidation could likely continue until Wednesday’s inflation report in the United States.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also largely unchanged on Monday, with price trading near a support level of $1,820.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,842.52 earlier in today’s session, following a move to a bottom at $1,824.12 on Sunday.
 
The price has since tailed off, with ethereum now trading around the $1,833.08 mark, at the time of writing.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
ETH’s lack of movement comes as the RSI has been unable to break out of a ceiling at the 43.00 zone.
 
Price strength is now at 42.11, with the next visible floor at 41.00, in the event bears capture market momentum.
 
Should this occur, a move below $1,800 could be the target.

We now know how to infer the daily price of bitcoin within 1% by looking only at the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set.
With this, we can build decentralized applications that rely on the UTXO set — rather than on trusted third-party oracles — for the USD price used in discreet log contracts (DLCs) and smart contracts.
The possibilities for decentralized applications on Bitcoin using this “UTXOracle” are enormous.

The transactions have raised questions of legality after a creative trader with the name, Hanwe Chang, deceived a competitor into purchasing specific Azuki NFTs at an inflated price. 
 
A Highly Controversial Transaction
 
Despite being a newcomer in comparison to other popular NFT marketplaces such as SuperRare and OpenSea, Blur has grown ahead of others in terms of trading volumes earlier this year, partly due to the gamified incentives that reward participants with tokens according to trade-based activity. 
 
 
This includes rewards in the form of an airdrop offered to users that bid on Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by trait, a practice which, a…]]></summary>

The CPI, a key measure of inflation, has been under the microscope as the US grapples with fluctuating inflation rates.
