The resolution comes after the US Department of Justice appealed a court order approving Voyager’s bankruptcy plan, which created a new hurdle for the crypto lender’s plan to sell its assets and transfer its customers to Binance.US in a deal valued at $1.3 billion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin rebounded from Wednesday’s drop, with the meme coin briefly climbing back above $0.090 in today’s session. However as the day progressed, bearish sentiment heightened, with price declining. Litecoin was also down today, and continues to trade near a multi-week low.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was volatile on Thursday, as prices moved back into the red, after an earlier rebound.
 
DOGE/USD fell to an intraday low of $0.08685 in today’s session, following an earlier high of $0.09297.
 
The meme coin has been volatile in recent sessions, after a week-long bull run was snapped on Wednesday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s candlestick has printed a large doji, with dogecoin now trading close to its open price.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) has found a floor at the 53.00 mark, which has helped maintain the uncertainty.
 
Should this floor give way, there is a good chance that DOGE will move towards a support point at $0.08000.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) traded near a three-week low in today’s session, as the token moved below $100.00.
 
Following a high of $101.95 on Wednesday, LTC/USD plunged to a low of $89.38 earlier today.
 
This is the lowest level that litecoin has hit since March 31, with bears now potentially targeting a long-term floor at $86.00.
 
 
As a result of today’s decline, the RSI has fallen to a point of support of its own at the 45.00 mark.
 
If price strength were to fall below this point, it is likely that LTC could head closer to $80.00.

He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
