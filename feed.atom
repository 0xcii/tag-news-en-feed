        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The markets are always buzzing with predictions, and the latest one is turning heads. Dogecoin price, a fan favourite, is expected to rally to $1 before December. Shiba Inu (SHIB), however, could shoot up to $0.0005. But perhaps the most shocking of them all is ETFSwap (ETFS), an Ethereum token, which could rise from $0.03846 To $35. 
 
ETFSwap (ETFS) Shows Promising Signs Of Long-term Prospects And Sustainability 
The core feature of ETFSwap (ETFS) lies in its ability to tokenize Spot ETFs. By tokenizing real-world assets, including gold, oil, and corn, ETFSwap (ETFS) taps into the massive ETF market and serves as a bridge linking both traditional ETFs and cryptocurrency-focused ETFs. This, in turn, removes the need of intermediaries while promoting flexibility and accessibility of Spot E…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dogecoin price has rallied by over 7% in the last 24 hours, outperforming Bitcoin and Shiba Inu. This price rally is primarily thanks to the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, who continues to support the foremost meme coin indirectly. 
 
Why The Dogecoin Price Rallied By Over 7%
 
The Dogecoin price rallied by over 7% following Musk’s tweet, in which he alluded to ‘D.O.G.E.’ Musk simply said in his post, “D.O.G.E will fix it,” in response to another post asserting that politicians and bureaucrats are the greatest threat to human progress and flourishing. 
 
 
The acronym stands for the ‘Department of Government Efficiency,’ a position that Musk could occupy under a Donald Trump administration. The former US President has said that if elected, he wants to use Musk’s expertise to curb exce…]]></summary>
