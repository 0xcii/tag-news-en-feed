Since September 1, 2020, a whopping 804,000 bitcoin, equivalent to $20.79 billion, has been pulled from centralized exchanges. Notably, 184,000 BTC of that sum, valued at $4.75 billion, was withdrawn in just the last three months.
 
Billions in Bitcoin Withdrawn from Centralized Exchanges Amid Rising Self-Custody Trend
 
Centralized exchanges are holding significantly fewer bitcoins (BTC) than they did three years ago. Cryptoquant.com data reveals that on September 1, 2020, trading platforms had a reserve of 2.828 million BTC. Fast forward roughly three years, and that number has dwindled to 2.024 million, marking a decrease of 804,000 BTC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao made a confident assertion last July that decentralized finance, commonly referred to as DeFi, is poised to rise above centralized finance, or CeFi, in terms of prominence and significance within the financial landscape. According to his forward-looking perspective, this transformative shift is expected to materialize over the course of the next six years.
 
Zhao pointed out a recent rise in institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, seeing it as a validation of the industry and its technology. He believes that if even a small portion of the trillions of dollars controlled by institutional investors in the equity market were invested in crypto assets, it would significantly boost the cryptocurrency market’s growth.

The latest powerplay? A Hail Mary interlocutory appeal from the authority. The agency tried appealing a past court decision allowing Ripple to use a “fair notice” defense. However, prominent lawyers vehemently oppose this, predicting its inevitable rejection.
 
Ripple’s chief counsel, James K. Filan, and Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal already called the SEC’s bluff. In their view, the rigid standards for an interlocutory appeal still need to be met. These mid-case appeals only proceed if waiting for a final verdict would cause “irreparable harm.” According to Filan, the agency has yet to prove this harm exists.
