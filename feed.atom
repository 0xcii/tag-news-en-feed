        <updated>2023-09-26T15:41:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash rose by as much as 5% on Tuesday, as bulls extended recent gains following last week’s consolidation. The token rose for a second consecutive session, moving closer to a resistance level of $225 in the process. BNB also climbed, pushing towards a ceiling of its own at $220.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was a notable gainer in today’s session, as the cryptocurrency climbed for a second straight day.
 
Following a low of $206.86 to start the week, BCH/USD peaked at $213.89 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw bitcoin cash close in on a resistance level of $225, which was last reached on September 18.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average remained above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) has broken out of a ceiling at 52.00, and is now tracking at 54.50.
 
A point of resistance at 60.00 now seems to be the next target for bulls, and if hit, BCH will more than likely be above $225.
 
 
BNB
 
BNB, formerly binance coin, was another big mover on Tuesday, as the token rose for a back-back session.
 
BNB/USD reached a high of $213.19 earlier in the day, after starting the week at a low of $208.02.
 
Overall, the native token of cryptocurrency exchange Binance now seems to be pushing for a ceiling of $220.
 
 
In order to reach this, BNB bulls will need to surpass an upcoming resistance point of 47.00 on the RSI indicator.
 
At the time of writing, BNB is now at a reading of 44.41, with the token trading marginally lower at $211.74.

The FSC has outlined key measures to regulate the

This forecast comes on the heels of recent developments that have bolstered the outlook for institutional adoption of Bitcoin by Wall Street firms.
AB estimates that the current size of the crypto fund management sector stands at approximately $45-50 billion. However, the firm's analysts argue that this figure has the potential to swell to over $500 billion in assets by 2028. This transformation would signify a transition from what AB dubs a "cottage industry" to a fully formalized, regulated asset management sector.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded from a multi-week low on Tuesday, as markets awaited the latest consumer confidence report in the United States. The latest figures from the Conference Board are expected to show a slight decline, with a reading of 105.9 in September. This will be down from 106.1 the month prior.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was back in the green on Tuesday, as its price rebounded from a multi-week low during yesterday’s session.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $26,421.51 earlier today, which comes following a low of $26,011.47 the day prior.
 
Monday’s low saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency trade at its weakest point since September 13, after dropping below $25,800.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the rebound in price came as a result of the relative strength index (RSI), finding a floor of its own at 45.00.
 
As of writing this, price strength is now tracking at 45.84, with the next visible point of resistance at the 55.00 mark.
 
Should bulls reach the 55.00 level, there is a strong possibility that BTC will move close to the $27,000 zone.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also rose higher on Tuesday, after dropping to a key point of support to start the week.
 
Following a low of $1,565.03 on Monday, ethereum rallied to an intraday high at $1,598.10 less than 24 hours later.
 
Not only did ETH bulls reject a breakout below a floor at $1,565, but also used this as a point of reentry, buying the dip in price.
 
 
Similar to bitcoin above, the surge came as a floor of the RSI also held firm, acting as a springboard for traders.
 
ETH continues to hover below the $1,600 level, however, this could change following this afternoon’s consumer confidence report.
