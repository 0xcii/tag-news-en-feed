The analyst said contrary to the West expectations, the sanctions against Russia have failed to destroy its economy. 
 
Russia’s Frozen Assets
 
According to Alexander Razuvaev, a Russian economist and financial analyst, the United States sanctions policy against Russia will undermine the dollar’s position as the world reserve currency. Razuvaev cited the U.S. plans to transfer Russia’s frozen assets to Ukraine as an example of Washington’s actions that may result in more countries dumping the greenback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okx has said it will be adding support for four inscription token standards to its Web3 wallet at the beginning of and in late February. The Web3 firm has said the addition of inscription standards to its Web3 wallet and marketplace helps Okx drive the adoption of Web3 and power its next growth phase.
 
Driving the Adoption of Web3
 

 
Okx, a Web3 technology company, announced on Jan. 29 that it will launch support for four new inscription token standards on its platform. The support will start with Bitcoin token standard and stamps (SRC-20) on Feb. 5, followed by atomicals (ARC-20), runes, and dogecoin’s doginals (DRC-20) later in the same month.
 

 
According to a statement, Okx will also add DRC-20, ARC-20, and Runes standards to its marketplace in late February, enabling users to trade these inscriptions with zero fees. The Web3 firm has said its ultimate goal is to help drive the adoption of Web3 and power its next growth phase.
 

 

 

 
Commenting on the addition of new inscription standards, which make Okx one of the leading one-stop inscriptions ecosystems in Web3, Okx Chief Technology Officer Jason Lau said:
 

 
“Okx strives to drive mainstream adoption of technologies on the leading edge of Web3, and our new inscriptions ecosystem is evidence of our commitment to this mission. By empowering users to easily buy, sell, create, and trade leading token standards on one platform with zero trading fees, Okx is simplifying access and removing barriers so users can explore and realize the potential of inscriptions.”
 

 
As per the statement, the Okx wallet’s inscriptions tool already supports the minting of inscriptions on 23 networks, including Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche-C, and Arbitrum One. In addition, the Web3 company’s inscription offering is said to be the industry’s most advanced, with liquidity across multiple inscription standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Veteran trader Peter Brandt has highlighted a bitcoin price pattern that frequently appeared in past major bull runs. “It is the Hump …Slump …Pump… Dump [HSPD] that keeps a bull trend healthy,” he explained, emphasizing: “Study past major bull runs in bitcoin and you will discover they were replete with HSPDs.”
 
Bitcoin Bull Runs and HSPD Pattern
 

 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt shared his observation about bitcoin’s price pattern he called the “Hump, Slump, Pump, Dump” (HSPD) on social media platform X Sunday.
 

 
“The old ‘Hump with a Slump then a Pump and a Dump’ is back — and this is the price behavior that separates Chumps from their money,” the trader described. “Study past major bull runs in bitcoin (BTC) and you will discover they were replete with HSPDs. The Chumps FOMO [fear of missing out] buy the Pump only to puke out their purchases with the Dump.” Brandt opined:
 

It is the Hump…Slump…Pump…Dump that keeps a bull trend healthy. Let’s see if HSPD works its magic once again.
 

 

 

 

 

 
Brandt regularly provides analysis of bitcoin’s price. He has also made several bullish statements about the cryptocurrency. On Jan. 18, he wrote on X: “I have a macro bias in bitcoin in a very broad sense — that BTC is a best candidate to be a tremendous store of value against the destruction of fiat.” On Jan. 6, he wrote: “Bitcoin is primary a store-of-value IMO and still has massive opportunities to appreciate. I think everything is junk, including ETH.”
 

 
However, the trader is skeptical about the impact of the Bitcoin halving on the price of BTC. On Dec. 21 last year, he explained on X: “The Bitcoin halving hype is a whole lot of excitement over nothing. Sure, halving hype might temporarily impact price. But the reduction of supply as % of daily volume is the size of a gnat’s ass.”
