        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The tides are shifting in the Bitcoin sea. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant, a blockchain analytics firm, paints a picture of a changing investor landscape, with a new breed of “whales” – high-volume crypto holders – entering the fray and established players holding their ground.
 
 
This influx of fresh capital is significant. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju reports that these “new whales,” likely hailing from traditional finance and entering through Bitcoin ETFs, have amassed a staggering $111 billion worth of Bitcoin. This edges the holdings of established, “long-term whales” whose collective stash sits at $67 billion.

The filing clarified that its US-based ODL services have shifted from using XRP to Tether (USDT) as a bridge currency.
 
Why Ripple Chose USDT
 
This strategic pivot was a response to the summary judgment in the SEC lawsuit which found that institutional sales fell under the US security laws. Since the ruling, non-US entities have been the sole contracting parties for XRP sales contracts to ODL customers. The filing highlights that “the company’s remaining ODL business in the United States uses a non-XRP bridge currency.”

In the lawsuit, the crypto firms argue that the new rule is “vague, overly broad” and fails to provide clarity on its implications for crypto market participants.
