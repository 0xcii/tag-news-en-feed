Why Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Prices Are Up
 
Dogecoin and Shiba Inu’s prices have surged thanks to macro developments like the monetary policies being rolled out by world governments. This has boosted investors’ confidence in allocating more capital to risk assets like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Earlier this week, the People’s Bank of China announced rate cuts and a stimulus package to revive the country’s economy.

The commission announced that the company was fined over 1.1 billion Korean won (roughly $830,000) for allegedly mishandling personal data and breaching overseas data transfer regulations.
 
These violations primarily centered around the collection and transfer of sensitive biometric data, particularly iris scans, without proper consent and notification.
 
 
More Details On The Matter
