This is an opinion editorial by Anant Tapadia, a computer engineer and contributor to Bitcoin self-custody projects Bitcoin Keeper and Hexa Wallet.
Multisignature security, or “multisig,” offers a different set of security guarantees than single-signature (singlesig) solutions cannot.

The British Royal Court recently sentenced a Ph.D. student of Oxford to four and half years in prison for a 2 million euro crypto scam on January 27. 
 
The 36-year-old student named Wybo Wiersma, a native of Goredijk in the Netherlands, created a website when he was studying at St Cross College.

In today’s news, a U.S. bankruptcy judge is looking to consider the approval of an independent bankruptcy investigation into the FTX collapse. This was revealed in a court hearing in Delaware which took place earlier today.
 
FTX is still one of the most investigated firms from one of many of last year’s bankruptcy filings. While the exchange initially portrayed itself as a trustworthy platform, it eventually collapsed when news broke that its chief executive and founder Sam-Bankman Fried aka SBF was reportedly using customer funds inappropriately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell to a seven-day low to start the week, as recent bullish momentum began to wear off in cryptocurrency markets. Friday’s stronger than expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report has made some question the Federal Reserve’s view that inflation has peaked. Ethereum also declined on Monday, however, it remained above $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the week falling to a seven-day low, as market sentiment began to shift downwards.
 
BTC/USD has now fallen lower for five straight sessions, with today’s decline taking prices to a bottom of $22,734.48.
 
This drop sees bitcoin hit its weakest point since January 30, when prices were trading at a floor of $22,500.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the world’s largest cryptocurrency appears to be heading towards this point of support once again.
 
Recent declines in BTC have come as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a floor at 68.00. It is now tracking at 61.15.
 
This is the lowest reading for the index in nearly a month, and comes following an extended streak in overbought territory.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also moved lower on Monday, however prices were able to remain above the $1,600 level despite the decline.
 
Following a high of $1,665.26 on Sunday, ETH/USD dropped by as much as 2% in today’s session, hitting a low of $1,616.30 in the process.
 
As a result of this sell-off, ethereum moved closer to its recent support level at $1,600. However, bulls have so far rejected a collision.
 
 
This has been helped by the RSI, which has found its own floor at 58.00, providing a soft landing for previous bulls.
 
ETH has since rebounded from earlier losses, and at the time of writing, is trading at $1,630.55.
 
Should this RSI floor of 68.00 hold, ethereum bulls may attempt to make another move towards $1,700 as the week progresses.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, not just SHIB, but Cardano (ADA) and Hex (HEX) have also seen high whale activity in the last few days. The relevant indicator here is the “whale transaction count,” which measures the total number of transfers taking place on the network that involve a movement of coins worth at least $100,000.
 
When the value of this metric is high for any cryptocurrency, it means whales of that particular coin are making a large number of transfers right now. Such a trend shows these humongous holders have an active interest in trading the asset currently…]]></summary>

The controversial proposal is currently being heatedly discussed again on Twitter after Valhil Capital CEO Jimmy Vallee brought up the idea again.
 
The theory is based on the belief that XRP will become the world’s reserve currency when government debt skyrockets worldwide and all banks switch to ISO 20022 and use XRP to conduct cross-border monetary transactions. This would mean that governments around the world would have to buy large amounts of XRP.

For instance, losing large sums of money seemingly suddenly and feeling helpless can unavoidably cause stress levels to rise and affect your self-esteem. Worse, it can ruin your outlook on life.
 
People may turn to alternative addictive substances to deal with these difficulties. So begins a pattern that can result in addiction, anxiety, depression, among other harmful things.
 
Rehab centers that treat bitcoin addiction are on the rise around the world, providing services for those with crypto exhaustion and other related “sickness.”
