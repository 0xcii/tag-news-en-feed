        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital asset custody services Archax has integrated  
Fireblocks, a platform for blockchain applications and digital asset  
management. This partnership aims to strengthen the security of Archax's  
operations and extend product offerings and market reach.
Archax Expands Digital Asset Custody Services
According to the press release, this collaboration  
enables Archax to manage its treasury operations more efficiently and leverages  
Fireblocks' multi-layer security to safeguard customer funds. Archax is an  
FCA-regulated digital asset exchange, broker, and custodian.
By integrating Fireblocks, Archax aims to benefit from  
the company's Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology and Intel SGX. The  
company emphasized the importance of collaborating with technology providers to  
give customers broader choices.
Besides that, the integration with Fireblocks allows  
Archax to extend its suite of services, including crypto OTC and exchange  
offerings alongside supported crypto trading pairs. Archax's custody service supports other functions such as the tokenization engine, which handles money market funds and Real World Assets, and the exchange platform, which offers  
trading in both crypto pairs and regulated digital securities.
Archax's partnerships extend beyond Fireblocks. The  
company has collaborated with Metaco, now Ripple Custody, to enhance its  
custody capabilities further.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Lisa's journey in the Bitcoin space has been multifaceted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) have debuted trading on the London Stock Exchange after receiving approval from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority. Asset managers WisdomTree and 21Shares both listed bitcoin ETPs on the LSE today.

NEW: 🇬🇧#Bitcoin ETPs will start trading on the London Stock Exchange today.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 28, 2024
 
 
 
Last week, the FCA gave the green light for Bitcoin ETNs to be listed on the exchange. This enabled today's launch from issuers who had been awaiting regulatory clearance to bring Bitcoin ETNs to the LSE.
21Shares listed two Bitcoin products: the 21Shares Bitcoin ETN (ABTC) and 21Shares Bitcoin Core ETN (CBTC). Meanwhile, WisdomTree launched its Physical Bitcoin ETN (BTCW).
All the ETNs provide exposure to the price of bitcoin. They are currently only accessible to professional investors under FCA rules. "But the game-changer in the UK will be when the retail ban is lifted; there is a retail ban on trading bitcoin and ether ETNs at the moment," Alex Pollak, head of UK for 21Shares, mentioned.

Today's debut is a milestone for both Bitcoin adoption and London's aspirations to be a digital asset hub. Other major financial centers like the US, Europe and Hong Kong already offer regulated bitcoin funds, pressing the FCA to catch up.
21Shares co-founder Ophelia Snyder emphasised, "The UK is one of the deepest, most liquid capital markets in the world."
The FCA is taking a phased approach to opening its market. Listing bitcoin ETNs enables professional investors to gain regulated exposure to crypto assets on the LSE for the first time.]]></summary>
