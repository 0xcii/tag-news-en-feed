        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), EIP-7781, introduced on October 5 by Illyriad Games co-founder Ben Adams, could significantly boost Ethereum’s transaction throughput by reducing the network’s slot time from 12 seconds to 9 seconds. The proposed change is aimed at increasing transaction throughput by approximately 33%.
 
The motivation behind the proposal is to better distribute bandwidth usage over time, thereby lowering peak bandwidth requirements.

According to Adams, this adjustment is designed to enhance throughput without compromising the accessibility of the network.
