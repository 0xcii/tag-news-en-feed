        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-surges-as-elon-musk-launches-x/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-24T15:41:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was one of Monday’s notable gainers, climbing by as much as 5%, following the news that Elon Musk was rebranding Twitter to X. Speculators believe the new platform will allow users to make crypto payments. XRP, on the other hand, fell to a ten-day low.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin surged by as much as 5% to start the week, as traders reacted to the news Twitter was rebranding to X.
 
Following the announcement, Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino tweeted that “X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.”
 
DOGE/USD hit an intraday high of $0.07718 earlier in the day, following Sunday’s low at $0.07056.
 
 
From the chart, the move came after a breakout occurred at the $0.0760 level, pushing the meme coin to its highest point since May 6.
 
This resulted in the relative strength index (RSI) escaping its own ceiling at 63.00, and it is currently at 65.46.
 
Traders will likely continue targeting the $0.08000 level.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP plunged to a ten-day low on Monday, as market sentiment seems to have shifted bearish in recent days.
 
After surging to a high of $0.7506 on Sunday, XRP/USD has started the week at a low of $0.6901.
 
This is the lowest level the token has traded at since June 13, when price was trading below $0.5000.
 
 
As a result of the decline, the RSI edged below a floor of 57.00, and is currently at a reading of 56.72.
 
Should the index extend its drop under this point, bears will likely look to take XRP back towards $0.5600.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, new addresses have been constantly coming up on the network during the past 24 weeks. The indicator of interest here is the “Supply Distribution,” which keeps track of the total number of wallets that belong to each of the groups in the market.
 
These address groups are defined on the basis of the amount of LTC balance. For example, the 1-10 coins group includes all investors or addresses on the network holding between 1 and 10 LTC right now.

This decline is a striking contradiction to the optimistic forecasts made by crypto enthusiasts, who anticipated a “golden age” for decentralized exchanges following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, eroding confidence in centralized platforms. 
 
Surprisingly, these decentralized exchanges’ monthly spot trading volumes have plummeted by a staggering 76% to $21 billion between January 2022 and June of the current year. In comparison, centralized crypto platforms witnessed nearly 70% in decrease during the same period, as reported by Bloomberg News, citing data provided by Kaiko.

Given the uncertainty about the exact amount of Bitcoins stolen, the total sum drained off the platform could potentially be even greater.
 
 
On the same day as the hack, DeDotFi took to Twitter and shared crucial details suggesting that the security breach was a result of a leak of private keys.
 
DeDotFi has confirmed that over $31 million was stolen in the hacking incident. However, there are further reports indicating that the scale of the compromise may be even more substantial, with some estimates suggesting that up to $100 million worth of funds could have been compromised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin neared a breakout below the $29,000 level on Monday, as traders prepared for this week’s Federal Reserve rate decision. In addition to the Fed meeting, consumer confidence data will also be released from the United States. Ethereum hit a three-week low. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was on the brink of falling outside of the $29,000 mark on Monday, as traders began to prepare for a big week of economic data.
 
Following Sunday’s high of $30,330.64, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $29,068.48 earlier in the session.
 
This drop has resulted in bitcoin falling to its weakest point since June 21, which is the last time price was below $29,000.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, bitcoin is over 3% lower than at the same time last week, with today’s sell-off coming when the relative strength index (RSI) fell below a floor of 45.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 42.93, with the next visible resistance point at the 41.00 mark.
 
Should the index reach this level, it is highly likely that BTC will be trading around the $28,800 level.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) also edged lower to start the week, once again dropping below $1,900.
 
ETH/USD slipped to a bottom at $1,837.98 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after peaking at $1,904.48.
 
Similar to BTC, ethereum has moved to a multi-week low as a result, with the price trading at its weakest point since June 8.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
A downward crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages has also occurred, which is a sign of potential bearish sentiment.
 
Further, the RSI is now at a reading of 44.67, which is its lowest point since June 19, when price was last under $1,800.
 
Bears may make another attempt to leave the $1,800 mark in the coming days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Ben Caselin, chief strategy officer for cryptocurrency exchange MaskEx.
As we navigate the uncharted waters of the digital revolution, bitcoin is increasingly finding their footing in economies grappling with currency crises. Countries such as Turkey, Lebanon, Nigeria and Argentina are already seeing bitcoin reach, or start to approximate, new all-time price highs, signaling a shift in wealth preservation and financial sovereignty. The thrust behind this trend is multifold, encompassing inflationary pressures, the global dominance of the U.S. dollar and the unique attributes of bitcoin.
A quick Google search for bitcoin against so-called “weaker” currencies in emerging markets, over a five-year time horizon, paints a clear picture.
