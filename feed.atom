        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin has dropped to as low as $58,000 in the last 24 hours, having failed to once again hold above the crucial support at $60,000. Different analysts have suggested that the CME gap caused this price decline and that BTC could enjoy a relief bounce going forward. 
 
The CME Gap Caused Bitcoin To Decline Below $60,000
 
Crypto analyst Daan Crypto hinted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin experienced this recent price decline to close the CME gap around the $60,000 range. The CME gap is the difference between BTC’s price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures market between when the market closed on Friday and reopened on Monday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The German government has transferred another chunk of its massive Bitcoin reserves to exchanges.
According to blockchain data, the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) moved roughly $75 million worth of Bitcoin across multiple transactions on July 4th. The funds were spread across exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp.
This comes after the government shifted around $315 million in bitcoin to various platforms since mid-June. Germany has offloaded over $390 million in Bitcoin in under a month.
In 2013, the BKA seized nearly 50,000 bitcoin linked to the former operator of the film piracy website Movie2K. The stash is estimated to be worth $2.3 billion at today's prices.
The steady flow of bitcoin to exchanges signals Germany's potential plans to liquidate portions of its reserves. This has sparked fears of impacts on Bitcoin's market price, which dipped below $58,000 this week.
However, the amounts transferred so far make up a relatively small share of the BKA's massive Bitcoin trove. After the latest movements, Germany still holds around 40,000 Bitcoin.
The sales mirror similar transfers by the U.S. government in recent weeks. America also holds Bitcoin confiscated from criminal cases, prompting concerns it may be selling reserves.
The liquidations come as creditor repayments from Mt. Gox's 2014 collapse appear set to begin in July. The timing threatens to compound selling pressure on Bitcoin.
However, proponents argue the amounts equate to a tiny fraction of daily Bitcoin trading volumes.]]></summary>
