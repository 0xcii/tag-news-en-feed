        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The European Banking Authority (EBA) plans to finalize  
its monitoring framework for stablecoin issuers by the end of this month,  
Coindesk reported. This development aligns with MiCA's broader regulations, which provide strict caps on transaction volumes and values.  
Specifically, stablecoins are prohibited from facilitating more than 1 million  
transactions or exceeding daily transaction values of 200 million euros.
Regulatory Caps Threaten Operations
The EBA is expected to release a detailed report clarifying how it will measure transaction volumes.  
Preliminary consultations suggest that transactions involving parties outside  
the EU may be excluded from the cap calculations. However, transactions with at  
least one party within the EU are likely to be counted.

On-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the US government had sent 3,940 BTC ($240 million) to Coinbase Prime. This has raised fears that the government may be looking to offload these crypto tokens, which would exert more selling pressure on the flagship crypto.

BREAKING: 🇺🇸 COINBASE IS SUING THE SEC, ALLEGING REGULATORS ARE TRYING TO CRIPPLE THE CRYPTO INDUSTRY. pic.twitter.com/bD1B1Vny1r
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 27, 2024
  
  
  
The lawsuits, filed on June 27th in Washington D.C. district court, allege the SEC and FDIC failed to comply with Coinbase's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Coinbase says this information could shed light on coordinated efforts by regulators to restrict crypto's access to banking services.
In its complaints, Coinbase asserts that federal regulators are deliberately campaigning to cut Bitcoin and crypto companies off from the banking system. This represents an existential threat to the industry by choking off vital financial lifelines.
Coinbase points to regulators pressuring banks to deny accounts and services to Bitcoin and crypto firms. It likens this to "Operation Choke Point," an Obama-era initiative discouraging banks from working with certain "high-risk" sectors.
The exchange argues regulators are violating transparency laws to hide the full scope of their crypto crackdown. Coinbase aims to expose regulatory overreach it says far exceeds agencies' mandates.
However, legal experts caution that FOIA lawsuits face an uphill battle given agencies' broad discretion over disclosure exemptions. Proving malicious intent by regulators could also prove difficult.
Nonetheless, the cases represent Coinbase's latest pushback against regulators like the SEC, with whom it is already locked in multiple legal battles. The exchange is defending the Bitcoin and crypto industry against regulatory hostility threatening its viability.
Coinbase's accusations resonate with Bitcoin and crypto proponents who believe regulators are abusing their powers to deliberately slow technological advancements.]]></summary>
