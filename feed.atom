        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s mining difficulty hit a record high after increasing 5.48% to 57.12 trillion. This rise signifies the need for a significant amount of computational power to discover blocks. Meanwhile, the network’s hashrate also reached a record high this past week.
 
Bitcoin Difficulty Jumps to 57 Trillion, Hashrate Spikes to Fresh New Highs
 
On September 19, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain recorded a 5.48% difficulty increase at block 808,416. This change followed the prior difficulty adjustment, which saw a 2.65% drop at block 806,400 on September 5. With the difficulty set at 57.12 trillion, it represents the toughest period ever for bitcoin mining.
 
The subsequent difficulty adjustment is anticipated on October 2, 2023. Since the surge to 57 trillion, the hashrate remains elevated, with current block times averaging nine minutes and 33 seconds.
 
 
Over the last month, the hashrate’s 30-day simple moving average (SMA) stood at 402 exahash per second (EH/s). The seven-day SMA reports 432 EH/s, while the three-day SMA shows a peak of 461 EH/s.
 
 
The network also set a 24-hour record with a swift ascent to 538.88 EH/s at block 807,830 on September 15. Currently, the hashrate hovers around 425.16 EH/s, with about 42 entities contributing SHA256 hashrate to the network.
 
The Foundry USA mining pool leads with 123.92 EH/s, accounting for 29.19% of the hashrate over the last three days. Antpool provides 95.25 EH/s or 22.44% of the total hashrate, while F2pool contributes 57.33 EH/s or 13.51% as of Tuesday.

aficionados and investors have been keenly following the moves of Bitcoin, the  
digital currency market's pioneer and bellwether. Bitcoin is displaying  
symptoms of a potential bull run after seeing unprecedented price rises and

interest in Bitcoin, as well as the variables that may contribute to another  
large price gain.
Adoption in  
Institutions
The increased  
institutional use of cryptocurrencies is one of the key drivers of Bitcoin's  
recent recovery. Institutional investors, such as hedge funds, asset managers,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to trade above the $27,000 level on Tuesday, after a crossover of moving averages triggered a return of bullish sentiment. The move pushed price to a multi-week high, with the global market cap trending over 1% higher. Ethereum also extended recent gains.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was once again trading above the $27,000 level on Tuesday, after moving averages crossed over in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $26,660.56 to start the week, BTC/USD surged to a peak of $27,414.73 earlier in the day.
 
This move has resulted in bitcoin remaining close to its strongest point since August 31, 2023, and marginally closer to a target of $28,000.
 
 
One of the catalysts was that the 10-day (red) moving average moved above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI), moved past another point of resistance at the 55.00 mark.
 
Currently, price strength is at a reading of 60.23, with a ceiling at 66.00 the next visible target for traders.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) also extended recent gains in today’s session, remaining near a multi-week high of its own.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,669.02 on Tuesday, which follows up from Monday’s low at the $1,628.41 mark.
 
Similar to bitcoin above, ethereum is now hovering near its highest level since the last day of August.
 
 
A breakout of a ceiling at 48.00 has just taken place on the RSI indicator, with a current reading at 50.28.
 
There are some slight hurdles upcoming, however the next level bulls could be looking to reach likely lies at 61.00.
 
In the event this point is hit, ETH will more than likely be trading above $1,700.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There may be over 10 financial giants filing to launch a Bitcoin ETF, but according to one analyst, BlackRock's application may be the one to watch.
In a CNBC video released Monday, Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman called BlackRock's filing "much more important" than the other prospective offerings. To date, other applicants include Fidelity, Digital Currency Group, and most recently Franklin Templeton, which joined the race just last week.
"If Blackrock has an ETF, you know that they are going to win. They have the marketing and distribution to put new people into Bitcoin," Dorman said.
According to the CNBC, BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset management firms, has been closely monitoring the cryptocurrency market for some time, even quietly exploring ways to incorporate Bitcoin into its investment strategies. 
This prospective move by BlackRock could signal a major vote of confidence in the cryptocurrency and might encourage other institutional investors to follow suit.
Elsewhere in the video, experts shed light on how a spot Bitcoin ETF could provide traditional investors with a regulated and accessible gateway into the cryptocurrency market. Experts believe that once the SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF, it will likely attract a broad spectrum of investors, from retail traders to institutional players, who have been waiting for a regulated vehicle to enter the crypto space.
Already, Bitcoin Futures ETFs are publicly traded, though these funds notably do not buy or sell Bitcoin on the open market.
Finally, the experts noted Bitcoin's broader narrative as a decentralized digital currency and store of value, as well as how the upcoming halving, in which the rewards Bitcoin pays out to the miners that secure the protocol will be reduced, could put a positive pressure on its price dynamics.
Taken together, the CNBC report was confident enough to declare a "next bull market" may soon be in store.]]></summary>
