        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/fidelity-has-opened-bitcoin-trading-to-the-public"/>
        <updated>2023-03-16T22:06:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The financial giant will now allow customers to trade bitcoin, although they will not be able to withdraw it to self-custody.
Customers of Fidelity Investments can now buy bitcoin through the broker. The Fidelity Crypto platform, first opened to a waitlist in November 2022, is now available to the public, as of yesterday.
Customers are able to buy and sell bitcoin, although they will not be able to transfer it to a self-custody wallet where the user controls their private keys. During the launch of the waitlist, there was mention of this ability to come later, but no detail or roadmap has been provided beyond that.
When trading, customers will not be charged a “fee,” but a 1% spread, which Fidelity has defined as “the difference between the price at which you buy or sell crypto in your Fidelity Crypto account and the price at which Fidelity Digital Assets fills your order.” This spread will be visible in the client execution price.
Trading will only be available to U.S. residents over the age of 18 in eligible states.
Fidelity’s foray into cryptocurrency has not been without criticism, with a group of senators, stating in a letter to the financial firm: 
“Fidelity Investments has opted to expand beyond traditional finance and delve into the highly unstable and increasingly risky digital asset market.”
But that seemingly hasn’t stopped Fidelity. 
While their introduction of the service to the public may be welcomed, it is specifically during moments like the current banking crisis that extra emphasis should be placed upon self-custody. Trust in institutions that are exceptionally large, similar to Fidelity, is what has led to the fiasco seen over the last week. 
So, while Fidelity is often regarded as a highly-trusted institution, it should still be noted that trusted third-parties are security holes, and that the only true way to sovereignly use bitcoin is through the holding of one’s own private keys.]]></summary>

Specifically, Emmer asked Gruenberg if the FDIC instructed banks not to provide banking services to cryptocurrency firms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid the instability in the US banking sector, the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has reportedly now made a decision against the crypto industry. According to a report published on Wednesday evening, potential buyers of the crypto-friendly Signature bank can now submit their bids but with a major condition. 
 
The report said buyers of the Signature banks are to submit their bids by March 17 and would have to give up all crypto businesses at the bank. This has raised controversy among the crypto community on how the US regulators are keen on disrupting the industry.

This is an opinion editorial by Dillon Healy, institutional partnerships at Bitcoin Magazine and Bitcoin 2023.
The biggest news of the last week has been the banking sector collapses, specifically crypto-friendly banks. On March 2, in their own SEC filing, Silvergate raised concerns around their solvency and ability to continue operating. This was, in my opinion, undeniably a result of direct and/or indirect exposure to the continuing contagion within the crypto industry created by collapses of Luna, 3AC, and FTX. As expected, a bank run followed from Silvergate partners to distance themselves and withdraw assets.
