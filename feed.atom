Bitget’s Martingale AI: A New AI-Centric Tool for Crypto Traders
 
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a significant topic this year. On Wednesday, crypto exchange Bitget announced the launch of a new AI-centric tool to assist traders. The Marting AI strategy aims to provide novice crypto traders with a convenient and advanced investment strategy enabled by AI.
 
The strategy utilizes historical market patterns and comprehensive information on market behavior and can be leveraged in both bear and bull market situations. On Wednesday, Gracy Chen, the managing director of Bitget, stated that the company plans to integrate more AI into its products to empower users.
 
“The launch of Martingale AI represents Bitget’s commitment to empowering users with the tools and strategies to invest confidently and smartly according to their needs,” Chen said. “Providing simple yet sophisticated offerings that leverage the power of AI aligns with Bitget’s mission to help individuals safely embrace digital assets.”
 
Bitget believes that both experienced and novice traders will benefit from the Martingale AI strategy. The company stated that Martingale AI provides customizable and automated trading strategies and supports up to 100x leverage.
 
“Novice traders can try strategies that are devised with a lower threshold by leveraging the AI and selecting according to the types divided by the system, namely – conservative, balanced and aggressive,” Bitget’s announcement on Wednesday detailed.

The news about Binance was not even 24 hours old when the SEC followed up with a lawsuit against Coinbase.
 
According to the SEC, Coinbase lacked licenses to operate its trading platform. The agency is also taking aim at Coinbase’s staking program, as Bitcoinist reported.
 
According to the order, Coinbase has 28 days to show cause why the SEC should not order the company to cease and desist from allegedly selling unregistered securities. However, a resolution in that time frame is unlikely, especially because Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has already announced that he is ready to take on the regulator.
