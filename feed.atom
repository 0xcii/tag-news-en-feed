        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price has been on a mesmeric run in the past few weeks, largely due to talks of the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) in the United States. And there has been broad commentary about what is to come for the premier cryptocurrency should the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlight the current applications for a spot ETF.
 
Cantor Fitzgerald, a prominent investment and brokerage firm, is amongst the latest entities to weigh in on the possibility and the potential impact of a Bitcoin spot ETF in the United States.

Why Sam Bankman-Fried Wanted To Sell FTX To Binance
 
According to a live report by CNN, SBF stated that he saw himself selling FTX to Binance when he and co-founder Gary Wang first started it in 2019 due to the number of crypto exchanges that already existed and the fact that he had no idea of how the company was going to get customers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chainlink moved towards an 18-month high to start the weekend, following a second day of bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency rose by as much as 7% in today’s session, despite the global market cap mostly consolidating on Saturday. Cardano also rallied, nearing a multi-month high of its own. 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) made considerable gains to start the weekend, as the token rose by as much as 7% in the day.
 
LINK/USD peaked at a high of $11.59 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after price fell to a low of $10.80.
 
Today’s gains pushed price closer to a recent 18-month high of $11.78, which was hit during the week.
 
 
The latest bullish push in LINK comes as the relative strength index (RSI) continued to trend upward, and it now sits at 81.68.
 
A ceiling is fast approaching at the 83.00 mark, and should bulls fail to break out of this level, there will likely be a reversal in price.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was another notable mover on Saturday, climbing closer to a recent nine-week high.
 
Following a low of $0.284 on Friday, ADA/USD raced to a peak at $0.2973 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the surge, cardano edged closer to its highest level since mid-August, when price traded over $0.30.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the 14-day RSI is now tracking at a reading above 77.00, which could prompt some bears to begin entering the market.
 
As a result, a handful of bulls have begun to secure gains, leading to ADA now trading marginally below today’s peak.
