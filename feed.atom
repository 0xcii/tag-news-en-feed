        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a concerted effort to tackle the escalating threat of online fraud, state authorities in Thailand have joined forces, emphasizing the need to regulate peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions involving cryptocurrencies. Led by Prasert Jantararuangthong, the Minister of Digital Economy and Society (DES), the collaborative initiative aims to curb the rampant use of P2P channels by scammers to launder money obtained through illicit activities.
 
 
Amid growing concerns over the proliferation of online scams in Thailand, recent estimates suggest that the damage inflicted by fraudulent schemes amounts to a staggering 100 million baht per day. Shockingly, a significant portion of fraudsters, approximately 80%, exploit the unregulated nature of P2P cryptocurrency transactions to evade detection and tra…]]></summary>

JUST IN: Wall Street firms with a combined $15 BILLION in AUM bought exposure to #Bitcoin ETFs in Q1
This is just the beginning 💥 pic.twitter.com/MQ1TZp8tQp
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 11, 2024
  
  
  
Companies that manage over $100 million in assets are required to disclose their equity holdings quarterly through 13F filings. Bitcoin investors have eagerly awaited these filings to see who is buying into the long-awaited Bitcoin ETFs.
The Q1 2024 13F filings released this month provide the first glimpse into institutional spot bitcoin ETF positions. While allocations remain small, the purchases signal growing conviction in Bitcoin's investment merits.
Among the largest buyers, $9.9 billion AUM Park Avenue Securities LLC bought into Grayscale's GBTC, while $1.3 billion Inscription Capital LLC also acquired shares.
Other institutions like American National Bank and Wedmont Private Capital purchased positions in spot bitcoin ETFs. The purchases ranged from a few thousand dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Still, across the board, major wealth managers, family offices, banks, and investment funds are still nibbling on spot bitcoin ETF exposure. This shows that despite Bitcoin's volatility, it is passing institutional due diligence.
Further, the 13F filings provide snapshots in time. Q2 filings will offer further insight when released in August. Wall Street is clearly growing more comfortable with Bitcoin, and this steady adoption by giants could well persist.]]></summary>
