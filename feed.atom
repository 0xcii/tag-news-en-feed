Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Have Been Increasing Their Holdings Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the BTC sharks and whales have been participating in accumulation during the past month. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the percentage of the total Bitcoin supply that a given wallet group is holding.
 
 
The addresses or investors are divided into these groups based on the number of coins they have in their balance right now. For instance, the 1 to 10 coins cohort includes all wallets holding between 1 and 10 BTC.

The wallet is great for those looking to send bitcoin on-chain with relative ease, but it leaves some to be desired for more advanced users or for those who want to make smaller payments quickly and cheaply.
Pros And Cons
Proton Wallet’s standout feature is that it allows you to send bitcoin using nothing more than a recipient’s email address, which doesn’t have to be a ProtonMail address. The non-custodial bitcoin-only wallet is also free to use and has an easy-to-navigate user interface (UI).
