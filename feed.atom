The Innovation and Technology Manufacturing Incentive (ITMI) Act revealed a broad spectrum of sectors where complete tax removal applies.
 
While countries such as the US administration wants high tax payments on technological innovations such as cryptocurrency mining, this new law could go far in attracting innovation-focused companies, which will bring development to the nation.
 
 
I’ve just signed into law, the INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURING INCENTIVES ACT, that eliminates all taxes (income, property, capital gains and import tariffs) on technology innovations, software and app programming, AI, computer and communications …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now headed to the state Senate, HB690 rectifies language that previously encompassed Bitcoin in its goal of restricting CBDC usage.
The North Carolina House of Representatives has unanimously passed House Bill 690, which prohibits the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) for payments to the state or any participation by the state in Federal Reserve branch testing of CBDC. The bill is now headed to the state Senate, where it is expected to be approved as well.
The latest version of the bill replaces the term "cryptocurrency" with "central bank digital currency," which is defined as a digital currency, a digital medium of exchange, or a digital monetary unit of account issued by the US Federal Reserve System or a federal agency. 
This new edition came after lawmakers seemingly mistakenly first introduced the bill with language that would encompass bitcoin as well. The bill also prohibits any state agency or the General Court of Justice from accepting payments using CBDCs and from participating in any test of a CBDC by any Federal Reserve branch.
Dan Spuller, Director of Industry Affairs at the Blockchain Association, explained to Bitcoin Magazine how the bill could serve as a model for other states, including Tennessee and Virginia. He also expressed his support for Bitcoin, stating that "any bill that is anti-CBDC is pro-Bitcoin." Spuller added that the bill’s language aimed to keep things "fairly simple, to the point and effective."
The bill received unanimous approval from the North Carolina House of Representatives, with a vote of 118-0. After the bill heads to the state Senate, if approved, it will need to be signed into law by the governor.]]></summary>

Dogecoin Wallet Revives After 9.3 Years: How Much Did It Make?
 
According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a transaction from a dormant address was spotted on the DOGE blockchain during the past day. This old address had carried 1,556,994 DOGE ($123,155) before its activation.
 
Detailed information about this wallet from the blockchain explorer service Blockchair reveals that the very first transfer this address made was on 23 December 2023.
 
Dogecoin had only launched earlier that month (6 December 2023), so the holder of this address must have been one of the earliest adopters of the cryptocurrency.

This update was disclosed earlier today after Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, claimed that the SEC needs to provide more regulatory guidance for crypto firms operating in the country.
 
The exchange demanded that the agency “at a minimum must set forth how those inapt and inapposite requirements are to be adapted to digital assets.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the United States stares down the barrel of a potential debt default come June, a curious and intriguing solution has emerged: crafting a single $1 trillion platinum coin. This unusual tactic exploits a legal loophole that allows the Treasury Department to mint platinum coins of any value. By delivering such a coin to the U.S. central bank, the Treasury would create enough funds to settle its debts. Though this proposal might sound bizarre, it’s gained traction as a potential escape route from the impending debt catastrophe.

This move could be viewed as an attempt to restart its exchange and generate returns from its operations.
 
The funds in question include $1.8 billion in loans and $273 million in collateral given to Genesis by Alameda Research, a now-defunct cryptocurrency trading house run by Sam Bankman-Fried. The loans and collateral were provided shortly before Alameda Research and the exchange filed for bankruptcy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France’s Senate Committee on Economic Affairs has made changes to a proposal under Bill No. 790 previously passed in the National Assembly. The original bill would have made it incredibly hard for crypto companies, including exchanges, from using the services of commercial social media influencers in their marketing campaigns. 
 
Reviewing The Strict Bill
 
The content of the latest version of Bill No. 790, reviewed by the Senate Committee, is “more relaxed” than the one passed by the National Assembly.
 
Specifically, it eliminates the need for crypto firms to get licensed after being registered by the country’s regulator, Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) before soliciting the services of an influencer to market their services.

But the tides started to turn because even if exploiting a smart contract nets a bigger payday than a bounty, it comes with a huge drawback. "There's a ton of risk when you engage in this, you know, wantonly criminal behavior and steal $200 million from someone else," he said. "There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>

Now Marco Santori, the company's chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
