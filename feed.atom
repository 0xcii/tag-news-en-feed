        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin ended a five-day losing streak on Friday, as the cryptocurrency appears to have found an interim price floor. This comes as traders continued to react to yesterday’s U.S. inflation report, which remained unchanged at 3.7%. Ethereum also edged marginally higher, following its own recent bear run. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) snapped a five-day winless run on Friday, as markets continued to react to the latest inflation report in the United States.
 
Following a low of $26,558.32 during Thursday’s session, BTC/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $26,919.04 earlier today.
 
Overall, today’s rebound in price came after BTC collided with the $26,560 level, with bulls using this as a floor, for now.

It appears that the longer-term point of support is at $26,000, however with the relative strength index (RSI) failing to move below the 45.00 level, price has yet to hit this zone.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 46.41, since failing to breach its floor at 45.00, however bears could attempt to send this lower in the coming days.
 
Should this level hold, there is a possibility that bitcoin reenters the $27,000 level this weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was marginally higher today, after it too rebounded from its own support level on Friday.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,553.51 during today’s session, which follows a bottom at the $1,523.24 mark the day prior.
 
Yesterday’s low was the weakest point that ethereum had hit since March 12, when price bottomed out at $1,612.

The 10-day (red) moving average has continued to extend its downward crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart, suggesting upcoming bearish sentiment.
 
Although the price is now above the floor at $1,535, there is a good chance that this could change in the coming days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Nigerian court recently convicted and fined a peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trader accused of running a pig butchering scam. According to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the crypto trader’s activities were “contrary to and punishable under the Cybercrimes (Prohibition etc.) Act, 2015.” 
 
Offense ‘Bordering on Cybercrimes’
 
A Nigerian court recently convicted a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trader accused by authorities of committing a “computer related fraud.” In his ruling, Justice Nicholas Oweibo of the Federal High Court ruled that the accused Lawrence Success Karinate has to pay a fine equivalent to $257.90 or N200,000.
 
According to a statement issued by the anti-corruption body, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Karinate faced one charge “bordering on cybercrimes.” The EFCC, which prosecuted the case, said the crime is in contravention of Section 22(2)(b) of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition etc.) Act, 2015.
 

 
The P2P Trader’s Pig Butchering Scam
 
Detailing how the crypto trader ran what the EFCC calls a pig butchering scam, the anti-corruption body’s said:
 
“That you, Success Lawrence Karinate, sometime in 2023, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, with intent to defraud, fraudulently held out yourself on social media platforms, as a female, bearing the name ‘Jessie Randall’, a fashion influencer, to unsuspecting members of the public, with intent to gain advantage for yourself and you thereby committed an offence, contrary to and punishable under Section 22(2)(b) of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition etc.) Act, 2015.”
 
Karinate, who pleaded guilty to the charge, was arrested by EFCC operatives in the Lekki area of Lagos State on May 26, 2023. At the time of his arrest, the operatives recovered a mobile phone which the crypto trader used to perpetrate the scam. According to the EFCC he admitted to gaining $2,000 from the scam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today on day two of Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023, the President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque, alongside Prince Filip of Serbia in a fireside chat, announced the creation of a Bitcoin business hub in the region to foster innovation. 
"Last night you showed me the picture of what will be the new Bitcoin business hub," said Prince Filip. "The association has been created to develop the development of technology and Bitcoin, and all the connections and partnerships you can have. It started with some guys in Madeira who work really hard, and it's open to everyone who wants to collaborate," responded President Albuquerque.
Prince Filip then went on to tell the president that he's very happy the region of Madeira is embracing Bitcoin, calling it "a technology for the future" and an "open, secure protocol akin to the internet." Filip, a staunch Bitcoin advocate and CSO at Jan31, has been helping educate lawmakers around the world on the benefits of nation state Bitcoin adoption.



"We're changing our economic [base] for technological companies, high tech, artificial intelligence, and Bitcoin of course," said the Madeiran president. "Everything that is connected with Bitcoin is welcome in Madeira."
At The Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami, it was announced that Madeira was embracing Bitcoin and that BTC investors will pay no personal income taxes in the region. "I believe in the future and I believe in Bitcoin,” said President Albuquerque last year. "Individuals in Madeira that buy and sell bitcoin ... don't pay taxes. They’re not subject to personal income taxes.”
Earlier this year, a delegation of Bitcoiners visited Madeira to discuss Bitcoin with the President Albuquerque, and to see the progress of its adoption across the region, which can be viewed below.]]></summary>
