        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[El Salvador, the first nation to officially adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is once again making headlines in the world of cryptocurrency. With the combined efforts of My First Bitcoin, Bitcoin Beach, and the Ministry of Education, the nation announced the inception of an ambitious pilot program today. This initiative aims to incorporate Bitcoin education in all schools across the country by 2024.
Initiated on the 2-year mark of the groundbreaking Bitcoin Law, this program is set to train 150 public school teachers about Bitcoin. After receiving their training, these educators will disperse across the nation, integrating Bitcoin knowledge into their respective curriculum and classrooms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Josef Tětek, a Bitcoin analyst at Trezor.
Self-custody is an absolute must for every bitcoiner. After the collapses of FTX, BlockFi, Celsius and many others, the merit of the “not your keys” mantra is beyond obvious. However, self-custody comes in many forms, and the security properties of a single-seed setup are not that great. That is why advanced bitcoiners should consider upgrading to a Shamir backup.
What is Shamir backup?
Shamir backup is a method for securely splitting a recovery seed while adding an element of redundancy. For example, with Shamir backup it is possible to have a 3-of-5 recovery seed, where the user writes down 5 lists of recovery words, and later needs only 3 of those lists to recover the wallet. Compared to a setup based on a single …]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ton-moves-towards-1-90-xlm-remains-near-recent-highs/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-07T16:05:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin was a big mover on Thursday, as the token rose by nearly 4%, closing in on the $1.90 level in the process. The rally came despite crypto price consolidation, with the global market cap largely unchanged as of writing. Stellar also surged, remaining near a recent two-week high. 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was one of Thursday’s notable gainers, as price rallied by as much as 4% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $1.75 on Wednesday, TON/USD rose to a peak of $1.88, earlier in today’s session.
 
The move comes days after the token reached a high of $2.05, which was the highest point it has hit since May.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rise in price comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped at a floor of 60.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 63.35, with the next point of resistance around 66.00.
 
In the event it moves beyond this level, there is a good chance that price will move back towards $2.00.
 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
Stellar (XLM) also hovered in the green, as the price remained near a resistance level of $0.1300.
 
XLM/USD rose to a peak of $0.1243 earlier in the day, which comes following a low of $0.1178 the day prior.
 
The move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average approaches an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
In addition to this, the RSI is on the cusp of breaking out of a key resistance level of 50.00, which has been held for close to a month.
 
Bulls will potentially aim to penetrate this point in the coming days, taking price near a ceiling of $0.1400.

turned out to be not only an unfavorable month for the prices of major  
cryptocurrencies but also for the performance of the largest exchanges.  
According to data collected by Finance Magnates Intelligence, the top

        <updated>2023-09-07T13:18:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that underscores the momentum of Bitcoin Ordinals protocol ecosystem, the OnChainMonkey (OCM) project has committed to migrating its entire digital art collection from Ethereum to Bitcoin. 
In total, moving the collection, which includes burning the old NFTs on Ethereum so they can no longer be traded, cost the project over $1 million in Bitcoin fees.
OnChainMonkey, created by Metagood, became the first profile picture collection created entirely on-chain in a single Ethereum transaction back in 2021. Further, it launched its first Ordinals collection in February shortly after the Ordinals launch.
Notably, the decision was supported by a broad portion of OnChainMonkey NFT owners, with users voting to subsidize a portion of the substantial migration cost.
The DAO proposal gained overwhelming support, with a quorum of 2,000 votes reached within 24 hours. Overall, 99% of voters backed the migration to Bitcoin, a sign that signals NFT users believe Ordinals on Bitcoin may have a greater value than Ethereum-backed NFTs.
"Our OCM community has conviction in our move to Bitcoin. We have been involved with Ordinals since the beginning of the year, and the OCM community, in particular, has a great understanding of the potential and benefits of the migration to Bitcoin," Metagood CEO Danny Yang said.
The transaction comes at a time when the Ordinals market has cooled considerably, with total transaction volumes and sales across exchanges seeing a notable decline.
That said, the news suggests this sector of the market could be gearing up for a second push given that Bitcoin Ordinals represent such a significant technology improvement over crypto-based NFTs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum continued to trade around a key price floor of $1,630 on Thursday, as price uncertainty in the market remained high. Volatility has slowed in recent days, leading to crypto prices mostly trending sideways. Bitcoin fell below a support point of its own earlier in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was trading marginally lower on Thursday, as the cryptocurrency moved below a key point of support.
 
BTC/USD bottomed out at $25,404.36 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after peaking at $25,953.02.
 
The decline saw bitcoin fall under a price floor of $25,600, before bulls intervened to send the cryptocurrency higher.
 
 
At the time of writing, BTC is now trading at $25,701.34, which sees price below $26,000 for a third straight day.
 
Although sentiment has been mostly bearish, price stability has largely remained, with traders so far avoiding a drop under $25,000.
 
This could be tested as we head towards next week, with several key economic announcements set to be released in the United States.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) tracked close to a support point of $1,630 for a fourth straight session, as traders continued to fight to secure marker momentum.
 
Following a low $1,611.15 on Wednesday, ETH/USD spiked to a peak of $1,656.93 earlier in the day.
 
Price has since slipped, with the world’s second largest cryptocurrency now trading around the $1,626.20 level.
 
 
The decline came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovered near a floor of its own at 36.00.
 
Looking at the chart, the index is now tracking at 36.30, with a move lower likely to trigger an increase in bearish pressure.
 
A move below $1,600 remains a real possibility for the coming days.
