"urgency" for central banks to consider the introduction of central  
bank digital currencies (CBDC) in response to the challenges posed by  
stablecoins. Stablecoins like tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) have gained  
widespread usage but often lack the stability implied by their name. Rhee  
expressed concerns that their adoption could diminish the role of central bank  
money and hinder the effectiveness of monetary policies. The Bank of Korea is actively  
working on a wholesale CBDC pilot and exploring its application in tokenizing  
real-world assets.

obstacles that threaten to impede progress in the crypto space. The dual  
challenge involves hurdles related to retail customer access to crypto products  
and the complexities surrounding companies attempting to open and maintain  
banking accounts within the UK.
Retail Customer Access at Risk
Retail customers' ability to access crypto products faces a critical  
challenge and a driver behind this seems to be the stringent app reporting  
requirements imposed by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR). While these  
measures enhance risk management, they inadvertently deny potential customers  
access to essential financial services, creating a roadblock for crypto
