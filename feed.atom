        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past decade, Coinbase has reached millions of cryptocurrency traders and expanded to become the largest crypto exchange in the US. Despite its solid reputation, Coinbase did not avert scrutiny and skepticism. It has intensified in the past two years, driven by the sharp upsurge and plunge in crypto prices in a short period. But what has become the hot topic was the sudden collapse of FTX, the former largest crypto exchange worldwide. 
Nonetheless, it remains an influential figure in the market. True believers regard cryptocurrencies despite not being a sure inflation hedge. Bitcoin’s inverse correlation with inflation showed how much macroeconomic indicators could affect crypto prices. Traders continue to capitalize on crypto volatility to generate massive gains.

        <updated>2024-02-21T19:33:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The High Court of  
Podgorica has approved the extradition of Do Kwon, the Co-Founder and Former  
CEO of Terraforms Labs, to the US.  Kwon  
faces multiple criminal counts in the US following the collapse of Terraform  
Labs. 
After rejecting South  
Korea's extradition plea, the Podgorica High Court deliberated over Do Kwon's  
fate following a directive from the Court of Appeal, Pobjeda reported. Earlier rulings had  
indicated conditions favoring Do Kwon's extradition, leaving the final decision  
in the hands of Justice Minister Andrej Milović.
However, the Court of  
Appeal clarified that Do Kwon, having consented to expedited extradition  
proceedings, would be subject to the jurisdiction of the requesting countries. 
Legal Arguments and  
Political Dimensions
Do Kwon's defense  
attorney, Goran Rodić, emphasized legal provisions favoring extradition to  
South Korea, citing international agreements and Montenegrin laws. Rodić  
contended that prevailing legal frameworks pointed towards South Korea as the  
appropriate jurisdiction for Do Kwon's extradition.
However, Justice  
Minister Andrej Milović framed the decision as politically significant,  
highlighting the USA's status as a key diplomatic ally. Milović underscored  
efforts to establish a bilateral extradition agreement, signaling Montenegro's  
commitment to bolstering international legal cooperation.

DOGE transaction volume has held steady above 1 million transactions every day throughout February, showing the current sentiment of traders and investors.
