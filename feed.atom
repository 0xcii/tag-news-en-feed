Amid this, there are key events that could drive the altcoin’s price toward $10 in the coming years, so here is a rundown.
 
Ripple Settlement With The SEC Coming Out Lower
 
One of the major reasons that could easily drive the XRP price toward $10 is Ripple emerging fully victorious over the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Now, the crypto firm has already secured multiple partial victories against the regulator, but with the SEC’s last-ditch effort being a $700 million settlement, all eyes are now on Ripple negotiating down this amount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Sunday, November 19, 2023, Bitcoin achieved a historic milestone, registering the highest number of daily transactions ever confirmed within a 24-hour span. A significant 710,579 transfers were confirmed by miners that day, including a significant portion of 475,249 Ordinal inscriptions.
 
Bitcoin Hits Lifetime Peak: 710K+ Transactions in 24 Hours
 
This recent weekend marked a record-breaking moment for the Bitcoin network. Operating at a robust hashrate of 480 exahash per second (EH/s), the network verified an unprecedented total of 710,579 transactions – a new peak in Bitcoin’s storied history. This surpassed the previous high set on September 15, 2023, when bitcoin (BTC) miners verified 703,692 transactions.
 
 
Furthermore, on November 12, 2023, the daily transaction volume (703,327) nearly eclipsed the former record, now ranking as the third highest in history. All of these days featured unparalleled levels of inscription-based transactions, with the most recent record established on Sunday accounting for 475,249 inscriptions.
 
Sunday emerged as the second most prolific day for inscription-based transactions, slightly trailing the record set on November 12, which saw 505,345 inscriptions. As of 2:40 p.m. Eastern Time on November 20, 2023, the day’s data remains incomplete, yet 411,723 transfers have already been processed by bitcoin miners, with 300,452 being inscriptions.
 
 
Inscriptions have surged recently after a brief dip, sparking a rise in miners’ fees due to a backlog of more than 200,000 transactions, which has driven up the cost of block space. Concurrently, as miners set new benchmarks in transaction processing, the network’s hashrate has soared to an unparalleled peak of 480 EH/s, based on the seven-day moving average.

The analyst who believes that the altcoin’s price is bound to cross the $100 level used Bitcoin’s performance to make the argument for why the token is well-positioned to reach triple digits.
 
Pitting XRP Against Bitcoin
 
In the forecast which was posted on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst 24HRSCRYPTO chose to put the performance of XRP up against that of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the industry. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s rise from $0.1 is proof that the altcoin can also rise to $100.
 
 
Furthermore, the analyst blasts the Bitcoin network for fees rising as high as $10 and even reaching $35, presumably putting XRP forward as the better choice since it is known for cheaper fees…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Magazine President Mike Germano noted the relevance of Crocs to the Bitcoin brand, saying: “Just like Bitcoin, people have said Crocs are dead for many years, only to be proven wrong time and time again. After all, Bitcoin and Crocs both have passionate communities. We wanted to recognize that by releasing Bitcoin Crocs for both to enjoy.”
Bitcoin Magazine is the exclusive merchant for the new Bitcoin Crocs Collection produced in a partnership between Bitcoin Magazine and Collect and Hodl, the progenitor of the Bitcoin Pez Dispenser.
The pre-sale begins Monday 11/20 and will be capped at 2,100 pairs produced for magic internet money enjoyers and comfort-minded podiatric connoisseurs alike.
Later this year Bitcoin Magazine will be offering a 5 pack of Bitcoin-themed Jibbitz™, with designs to be announced and revealed at a later date.]]></summary>
