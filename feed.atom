        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new and challenging form of malware dubbed “Realst” currently targets macOS and Windows users, posing a particular risk to Apple computer owners.
 
This cunning malware disguises itself as fake blockchain games, such as Brawl Earth and Dawnland, and spreads through social media promotions and direct messages, putting unwary users in harm’s way.
 
When unwary victims fall into its trap and use the offered access codes to access the threat actor’s website, their devices become prone to attack.
 
Realst demonstrates its destructive goal by silently stealing sensitive data from web browsers and cryptocurrency wallet apps, exposing users’ personal information and digital assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated marginally above the $29,000 level on Wednesday, ahead of today’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. It is widely expected that the Fed will increase rates by 25 basis points, after holding off on hiking last month. Ethereum also remained mostly unchanged.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin started today’s session largely unchanged, as traders anticipated the latest Federal Reserve rate decision.
 
Following a low of $29,097.47 on Tuesday, BTC/USD marginally rose to a high of $29,382.11 earlier today.
 
This move saw the cryptocurrency consolidate around a support point at the $29,100 mark, which was last fully broken on June 21.

Another floor was hit in today’s session, as the relative strength index (RSI) collided with the 42.00 zone.
 
 
Price strength has since rebounded, and at the time of writing this is tracking at a reading of 42.09.
 
Should the index remain above this level after today’s rate decision, there is a good chance that BTC could move back towards $30,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) also consolidated on Wednesday, trading close to a key price floor at $1,850.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,867.32 earlier in today’s session, before slipping to a current day’s low of $1,849.44.
 
The decline came as the 10-day (red) moving average extended its downward crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.

A key area to pay attention to is the floor at 45.00 on the RSI. The index is currently hovering around this mark, however a breakout could result in further declines.
 
 
In the event this occurs, the next visible support level to pay attention to will be the 40.00 zone.

A UK judge has ruled that Wright must pay £400,000 ($516,000) in security for legal costs to continue his case against the exchanges.
 
Craig Wright has long asserted that he is the mastermind behind Bitcoin. However, the authenticity of his claim remains hotly contested within the community. Despite previous lawsuits seeking copyright to the BTC white paper, no court has definitively established Wright as the true creator of Bitcoin. Why?

Real estate has proven to be an effective store of value over the last few decades, with property prices around the world having risen sharply since the 1970s. This development coincides with the "Nixon shock" of August 15, 1971, when U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would end the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold. 
Since then, central banks around the world have started operating a fiat-based monetary system with floating exchange rates and no real currency standard at all.

In an eye-opening interview, Timothy Massad, the former chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, recently emphasized the importance of government attention toward the stablecoin ecosystem.
 
Massad acknowledged that stablecoins are a crucial “connector” between cryptocurrencies and the “real world.” These digital currencies aim to minimize the notorious volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, making them more appealing to the mainstream audience. 
 
However, some regulators have dismissed these digital assets as a passing trend without fully comprehending their potential.
