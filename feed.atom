        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-surges-to-fresh-2-month-high-avax-rebounds-on-tuesday/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-25T16:05:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin rose for a third consecutive session on Tuesday, as markets continue to speculate what role the meme coin could play on the newly rebranded X platform. The latest surge took the price to its highest level since early May. Avalanche was another notable gainer today, rebounding from recent losses.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) climbed to a fresh multi-month high on Tuesday, as traders continued to react to Twitter’s rebrand to X.
 
Following a low of $0.07353 to start the week, DOGE/USD spiked to a peak of $0.07811 earlier in today’s session.
 
This resulted in the meme coin climbing to its strongest point since May 6, which is the last time price was above $0.08000.
 
 
Honing in on the chart, it can be seen that a breakout of the 63.00 zone on the relative strength index (RSI) triggered this latest rally.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 66.66, and looks set to be heading for a ceiling at 70.00.
 
In the event this destination is reached, there is a good chance that DOGE will be back at $0.08000.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
Additionally, avalanche (AVAX) was back in the green during today’s session, after rebounding from Monday’s decline.
 
AVAX/USD ascended to a high of $13.38 earlier in the day, a day after slipping to a bottom at $12.92 to start the week.
 
The move came as the token closed in on a key support level at $12.90, however bulls rejected a breakout on this occasion.
 
 
Price strength also held firm at a support point of 44.00, before rising to a current reading at 47.28.
 
Despite this, momentum remains bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average nearing a downwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.

So far this year, a total of nine such block rewards from the 2010 era have been spent, resulting in the transfer of 450 bitcoins.
 
2010 Block Spend Makes the Ninth This Year
 
According to btcparser.com, a rare 2010 block reward was spent on Monday, transferring 50 bitcoins to an unidentified address. Although 50 bitcoins may not be a substantial sum, it is valued at $1.4 million, and expenditures of bitcoins from 2010 have become much less common nowadays. Moreover, the 50 bitcoins were essentially valueless back then, as bitcoin did not hit the five-cent mark until July 17, 2010.

Binance To Seek Dismissal Of CFTC Complaint
 
On March 27, 2023, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a complaint against Binance Holdings, CEO Zhao, and a former compliance officer for operating an illegal exchange and “ineffective” compliance program. 
 
The commission alleged that the crypto exchange “offered and executed commodity derivatives transactions on behalf of US persons,” thereby violating US laws.

The researcher disclosed that a malicious phishing program has been detected on the Apple App Store which he described as the newest form of attack targeting Apple IDs.
 
Cryptocurrency users have been warned to be particularly cautious as many of them rely on iCloud to back up their wallets. This is because, in the event of an attack, their assets could be at risk of loss if their 2FA gets compromised.
 
The malicious phishing program is able to do this by replicating normal applications. And subsequently, the attacker adds their own number to the trusted two-factor authentication list, thereby gaining control over the account permissions.
