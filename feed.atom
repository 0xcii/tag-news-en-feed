Balchunas opines that BlackRock has a 50% chance of gaining approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF from the regulatory body, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This prognosis is particularly noteworthy, given the ongoing reluctance of the SEC to greenlight Bitcoin ETFs due to concerns surrounding market manipulation and liqui…]]></summary>

The uncertainty came as crypto custodian Prime Trust entered receivership, after being found to be illiquid by authorities. Ethereum also declined, once again falling below $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated on Wednesday, as traders opted to secure profits following a recent bull run.
 
BTC/USD broke out of a key resistance level at $30,800 on Tuesday, on its way to a peak at $31,006.79 late in yesterday’s session.
 
However, take profit orders seemed to have been triggered, with bitcoin dropping to an intraday low of $30,169.78 today.

For years, Bitcoiners have been telling almost everyone who would listen that bitcoin is undervalued. Any Bitcoiner who's done the research knows that bitcoin the asset is radically undervalued. And I wholeheartedly agree! But even though bitcoin, the asset, is undervalued, it pales in comparison to how much the Bitcoin network is undervalued. I have long held that Bitcoiners, as a group, are undervaluing the Bitcoin network as much or more than no coiners are undervaluing bitcoin the asset.
So, it is with some amusement that I observe the fierce debate between the Bitcoin purists who believe that the use of the Bitcoin network (i.e., the immutable digital ledger) is only for sending valu…]]></summary>

Voyager Digital’s struggle illuminates the challenging climate for crypto firms amid market volatility, leading to the eventual bankruptcy of the company. This unfortunate turn of events has led Voyager Digital to rely heavily on the expertise of Kirkland & Ellis, its legal advisor, to navigate through its bankruptcy process. 
 
However, Kirkland & Ellis’s aid comes at a steep cost, as Voyager Digital is expected to spend approximately $1.1 million on fees and expenses incurred by the law firm in April.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Swiss National Bank (SNB) said it plans to issue a wholesale central bank digital currency as a pilot via SIX Digital Exchange, a subsidiary of SIX, an operator of infrastructure for the Swiss and Spanish financial centers. SNB chairman Thomas Jordan said while the Central Bank has not ruled out launching retail CBDCs, the bank is being “a little bit prudent at the moment.”
 
‘This Is Not Just an Experiment’
 
The Swiss central bank said on June 26 it intends to issue wholesale central bank digital currency on SIX Digital Exchange, a subsidiary of SIX, an operator of infrastructure for the Swiss and Spanish financial centers. According to Thomas Jordan, the chairman of the Swiss National Bank (SNB), the pilot CBDC project is expected to commence soon and will run for a limited period.
 
However, the SNB chairman who spoke at the Point Zero Forum, revealed that the experiment would involve the use of a real money equivalent.
 
“This is not just an experiment, it will be real money equivalent to bank reserves and the objective is to test real transactions with market participants,” Jordan reportedly said.
 

 
Central Bank Not Keen on Launching Retail CBDC
 
By taking this step, the Swiss central bank joins its peers in countries which have either launched their respective CBDCs or are still in the trial or study phase. Their objective, according to a Reuters report, is to avoid ceding control of digital payments to the private sector.
 
Meanwhile, during his address at the forum, the SNB chairman attempted to explain why the central bank is currently unwilling to launch a retail CBDC. He said:
 
“We do not exclude that we will never introduce retail [CBDCs] but nevertheless we are a little bit prudent at the moment.”
