Matrixport Links ETF Inflows to Possible Bitcoin Price Rise
 
In an investor note published on Thursday, the crypto firm Matrixport said the approval of Blackrock’s spot bitcoin ETF could potentially bring between $24 billion and $50 billion of inflows into bitcoin. This is based on the assumption that between 10% to 20% of investors in precious metals ETFs, which have about $120 billion in assets, may allocate 1% of their portfolios to a bitcoin ETF.
