Alleged Link Between Crypto And Child Sexual Abuse
 
In the letter, the senators highlight the “pseudonymity” provided by cryptocurrencies, which they say has enabled the rapid movement of payments for CSAM into the crypto world.
 
It was also stated that both Warren and Cassidy are committed to ensuring that Congress and the Administration have the tools necessary to end CSAM and hold those responsible for its distribution accountable.

Bloomberg has reported that the profitability of Bitcoin mining is nearing a record low, not seen since the days following the collapse of FTX, posing significant challenges for those securing the network.
 
The data indicates that the “hashprice,” a metric that gauges the revenue a miner earns daily for each petahash of computing power, has dipped alarmingly close to its all-time low.
 
This decrease is notable, considering it came after the recent Bitcoin halving event on April 20, which traditionally boosted the cryptocurrency’s value but, this time, failed to counteract the bearish pressures from global economic uncertainties.

Thin Sell-Side, Big Potential Move For ETH
 
Thinning sell-side liquidity, as seen on order books across CEXes, means that few sellers are willing to liquidate. With few sellers on the market, a small upsurge in demand could theoretically see prices skyrocket. 
 
 
Even so, market makers could fill this imbalance by considering how the market works. At the same time, prices are not guaranteed to rally even if they remain as they are.
