With bears currently in command, forcing prices lower, the odds of prices falling even lower beyond the current lows appear elevated. 
 
 
For the ongoing uptrend to persist and for bulls to breathe a sigh of relief, a robust close above $70,300 is necessary. This potential upswing could decelerate the current sell-off and align prices with the…]]></summary>
