Assange, who is wanted on 18 charges related to the release of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables, will, however, renew his appeal next week according to a report by Reuters. The British High Court ruled that Assange had no legal grounds to challenge the extradition decision.
Previously, a British judge ruled against Assange's extradition, citing concerns about his mental health and the risk of suicide if held in a maximum security prison. However, the decision was overturned on appeal after the U.S. authorities provided assurances, including the possibility of transferring Assange to Australia to serve any sentence.

Bitcoin Active Addresses Spike Following Uptick In Volatility
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, utility on the network has picked up quite drastically recently. The “active addresses” here refer to the Bitcoin addresses that are taking part in some kind of transaction activity on the blockchain. These addresses can be both senders and receivers.
 
The “daily active addresses,” an on-chain indicator, measures the total number of unique such addresses that are appearing on the network every day. By “unique,” what’s meant here is that the metric only counts every active address just once, implying that even if a wallet makes multiple tra…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana moved towards the $20.00 mark on Friday, despite reports confirming that Robinhood was set to delist the token from its platform. In addition to solana, cardano and polygon were also removed. XRP also trended higher in today’s session.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) moved close to the $20.00 level on Friday, despite news that Robinhood was removing the token from its platform.
 
According to reports, the removal will occur on June 27. This comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) determined that several tokens on Coinbase and Binance were securities.
 
Following a low of $18.56 on Thursday, SOL/USD moved to an intraday high of $19.30 during today’s session.
 
 
Today’s surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) neared a resistance level of 43.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.14, with SOL at the $19.08 level.
 
Despite earlier gains easing after the reports, SOL remains above yesterday’s low.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, managed to avoid Robinhood’s hit list, surging by over 3% on Friday as a result.
 
XRP/USD jumped to a peak at $0.5324 earlier in today’s session, which comes less than 24 hours after the price bottomed out at $0.5184.
 
Friday’s surge in price led to the token briefly breaking out of a key resistance level of $0.5320.
 
 
This comes as the RSI collided with a ceiling of its own at 64.00, with bears so far rejecting a breakout.
 
Currently, the index is tracking marginally lower at 63.50, with longer-term bulls targeting a higher ceiling at 70.00.
 
Should they reach this point, there is a good chance that XRP will trade close to $0.5800, which was last hit in March.

In the mid-’90s he founded a telecom company that offered internet access along with telephone service. In 2000, he launched Echovox, which he spun out into Zong in 2008 — a mobile platform that let users pay for things online directly through their mobile phone bills. When this venture was acquired by PayPal in 2011, Marcus joined the digital payments giant, becoming its president the next year.
He’d read the Bitcoin white paper shortly after it was published, but “didn’t fall into the rabbit hole” at first, he recalled in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. Then, in 2012, Argentina ordered PayPal to stop all transactions that would send money out …]]></summary>

You’ve probably heard something along the lines of, “Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is around the corner,” or, “Now that language is solved, the next step is conscious AI.”
