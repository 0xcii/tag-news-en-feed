At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $17.3, up 25% in the last 24 hours. The below chart displays the trend in the crypto’s price over the past month:
 

 
 
As displayed in the graph, Solana was declining in December as the coin ended its terrible year, 2022, but since 2023 has started, the coin has caught some sharp upwards momentum. In the last week …]]></summary>

Moreover, SBF’s quantitative trading firm allegedly owes more than $55,000 to Jimmy Buffett’s beach resort, Margaritaville, after Alameda and FTX executives occupied 20 suites for a few months last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amongst other updates designed to make new users’ experience easier, a new software update enables wallet funding directly through the application.
Fountain Podcasts, a Lightning-enabled podcast app designed to facilitate value for value transactions, has introduced their 0.6.0 update with many features oriented towards capturing new value for value users. 
In a blog post, Fountain highlighted the new ability to fund your Fountain account via a partnership with MoonPay. Through this partnership, users can now use a debit card or credit card to purchase satoshis which arrive in the app’s wallet shortly thereafter.
The update also brings the arrival of the activity page, a feed which shows popular episodes and clips. The release describes how, “This is just the first of many new social discovery features we will be adding to Fountain that use money as a signal for value.” 
In addition to these larger updates, several UI changes were implemented, including a new content card design, the ability to reply to clips, clips and comments being displayed on the episode pages under Activity and more. 
Through the Fountain app, podcasters can receive sats for the content they provide, while listeners can receive sats for likes on their comments or clips. Streaming your favorite podcaster sats on a minute-by-minute basis provides a direct link between the consumer and the content creator, and is a way to empower these creators using Lightning. 
By facilitating this value for value model, podcasters can avoid external sources of funding. In many industries, but especially in the Bitcoin industry, these external sources can introduce conflicts of interest which can potentially even prove harmful to consumers who trust their favorite podcasters. With software like Fountain, these consumers can directly support these podcasters and reduce the potential for such events.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana surged by as much as 22% on Monday, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. The move saw the token climb to its highest point since November, when it was embroiled in the FTX collapse. Cardano also moved higher to start the week, climbing by nearly 13%.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was one of Monday’s big movers, as prices of the token rose by as much as 22%.
 
SOL/USD surged to an intraday high of $16.62 to start the week, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $13.47.
 
Today’s rise in price pushed SOL to its strongest point since November 12, days after the token plummeted, after being exposed to the FTX/Alameda scandal.
 
 
From the chart, Monday’s rally came following a breakout of a key resistance level at the $15.00 mark.
 
As a result of this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has risen to 73.26, which is its strongest point since April.
 
Due to prices now being relatively overbought, there is a strong possibility that there could be a reversal in momentum in the coming days.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was another notable gainer to start the week, with the token climbing for a second straight day.
 
Following a low of $0.2865 on Sunday, ADA/USD hit a high of $0.3409 earlier in today’s session.
 
Like with solana, this move saw cardano hit its highest mark since November, and came after a breakout of a ceiling at $0.3250.
 
 
Looking at the chart, as a result of today’s rally, the 14-day RSI rose to a level not seen since September 2021.
 
Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, and as of writing, ADA/USD is trading at $0.3247.
