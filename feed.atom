        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, the analytics firm Peckshield alerted the community to another transfer of crypto assets from FTX wallets to centralized exchanges. Nearly $20 million in digital currencies were moved after the estate transferred $8.6 million in cryptocurrencies to Binance earlier in the day.
 
FTX Mobilizes Millions in Crypto to Centralized Exchanges in Second Major Move
 
The estate handling FTX’s bankruptcy has been relocating coins to centralized crypto exchanges. Following an $8.6 million transfer on Wednesday, the estate moved nearly $20 million during the evening hours of that day. The analytics and onchain intelligence company Peckshield detected the movement, with its alert system notifying the community at 10:56 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday.
 
Peckshield disclosed that about 470,000 solana (SOL), worth $15 million, were moved to centralized exchanges including Binance. The onchain analytics alert system further detailed that FTX transferred coins such as ETH, COMP, and RNDN. Further, an additional $2.5 million in ether was reportedly sent to the centralized exchange Coinbase.
 
“In addition, FTX-labeled address has transferred ~1,393 ETH (~$2.5M) to Coinbase,” the Peckshield alert added.
 
 
Observers can only speculate that the coins were sent to be sold, as their movements become opaque once held on an exchange. Besides sending crypto assets to exchanges, presumably to trade or sell them, FTX debtors have also engaged in staking assets. To date, the estate has staked millions worth of SOL and roughly $5 million worth of ether. The estate continues to work on the final proposals in the bankruptcy case, drawing closer to completion.

Shibburn Claims Ryoshi Holds $1 Billion In Shiba Inu
 
According to an X (formerly Twitter) post by Shibburn, the Shiba Inu community-driven burn tracker, the burn tracker has claimed that Ryoshi holds a significant $1 billion worth of SHIB tokens amounting to over 10% of the token total supply. The claims basically contradict the previous belief about Ryoshi that he had no SHIB holdings.
 
 
The foundation of the tracker’s claims can be traced back to the historical data from Bubble Maps, a renowned on-chain analytical platform. In January 2023, it showed that a considerable amount of the SHIB supply was unde…]]></summary>

New York State (NYS) is one of the most restrictive jurisdictions in the world in regard to Bitcoin. Since 2015, NYS has required companies that deal in the virtual currency marketplace to obtain a “BitLicense” in order to do business in the state. This license is both difficult and expensive to acquire. Bitcoin-only exchanges like River and Swan as well as long-standing, reputable crypto exchanges like Kraken cannot serve residents of NYS because they do not have BitLicenses (for Swan, some NYS residents are grandfathered in from a time when Swan was permitted …]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-26T12:43:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a brief spell above $35,000 late on Wednesday, bitcoin retreated below this level during today’s session. Despite the decline, the cryptocurrency continues to trade close to an 18-month high on Thursday. Ethereum rose back above the $1,800 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin once again fell below the $35,000 level on Thursday, after a brief stint above this level on Wednesday.
 
Following a high of $35,133.76 late in yesterday’s session, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $34,151.88 earlier today.
 
The move saw bitcoin continue to trade close to its strongest point since May 2022, when price was over $37,000.
 
 
At the time of writing, bitcoin is now trading at $33,990.55, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to penetrate the 90.00 zone.
 
Currently, the index is at a reading of 82.99, which remains significantly overbought in the medium term.
 
Should sentiment begin to truly shift bearish, a floor at $31,000 is the likely target for bears in the market.
 
 
Ethereum
 
On the other hand, ethereum (ETH) was mostly higher, leading prices back above the $1,800 level.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,865.10 earlier in today’s session, following a low at $1,781.49 on Wednesday.
 
As a result of today’s surge, ethereum rose to its highest level since August, when the price hovered below $1,880.
 
 
The cryptocurrency has now traded in the green for seven straight sessions, adding nearly 20% to its value during this period.
 
Overall, the 10-day (red) moving average continued to race ahead of its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which is a sign that momentum remains bullish.
 
At the time of writing, the RSI is at 74.90, which could cause current buyers to soon begin to capture gains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Pengyu Wang, the founder of Particle Network, developer solutions known as zero-knowledge wallet-as-a-service (ZK-WaaS) embody Web3 principles and “are highly performant” which in turn makes them “an evergreen solution that will become the industry standard.” Wang also points to how zero-knowledge technology helps ensure a core principle of Web3, asset sovereignty for end users, is upheld.
 
‘Complexities Associated With Traditional Web3 Wallets’
 
In written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, Wang also pointed to how WaaS can turn out to be a developer solution that ultimately brings the masses to Web3. According to the Particle Network founder, this is due to the fact that WaaS wallets are not burdened with the “complexities [often] associated with traditional Web3 wallets.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto market is currently experiencing a significant upswing, with cryptocurrencies collectively gaining $1.3 trillion in market capitalization over the past week. This surge in enthusiasm for digital assets coincides with the imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States, providing a major boost to the entire crypto ecosystem.
 
As a striking counterpoint, the tech stock market has been grappling with a substantial decline. Nearly $200 billion was wiped from the market capitalization of the so-called “magnificent seven” tech stocks, a group that includes heavyweights such as Meta, Apple, and Alphabet. These tech giants collectively contribute a quarter of the value of the S&P 500 index.
