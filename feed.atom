        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the new HBO documentary “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery Documentary”, filmmaker Cullen Hobak posits that Peter Todd, a prominent Canadian Bitcoin core developer, is the elusive Bitcoin creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Despite the sensational claims, the evidence presented falls short of conclusive, leading to significant criticism from the BTC community.
 
Peter Todd, known for his substantial contributions to Bitcoin’s development post-2012, including the introduction of the replace-by-fee (RBF) protocol and work on OpenTimestamps, has been a prominent figure in the Bitcoin space. However, associating him with the creation of Bitcoin has raised eyebrows due to inconsistencies in timelines and the nature of the evidence presented.
