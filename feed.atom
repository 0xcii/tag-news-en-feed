        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent discussion within the XRP community has reignited speculation surrounding the token’s future price trajectory. The catalyst for this discussion was a bold prediction made by Crypto Tank, a prominent crypto analyst. He suggested that XRP could reach a $100 price target if it captures 10% of the daily transaction volume handled by SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.
 
XRP’s Ambitious $100 Price Target: A Deep Dive
 
To provide context, SWIFT processed approximately $5 trillion in daily transactions as of June 2022. If XRP were to secure 10% of this volume, it would equate to handling roughly $500 billion in daily transactions. This significant increase in transaction volume could potentially drive a substantial rise in XRP’s price.
