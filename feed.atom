        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant turn of events, Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs, has once again evaded extradition to the United States as the Montenegro government reversed its decision. 
 
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had been pushing for charges against Kwon, with March 25th being the deadline for the Montenegro government to take action.
 
Appellate Court Overturns Extradition Ruling
 
According to a press release issued by the Montenegrin Court of Appeal on Thursday, the panel accepted the appeal filed by Do Kwon’s defense attorneys in a February 7, 2023, session. 
 
As a result, the court annulled the previous decision made by the High Court in Podgorica on December 29, 2023, and sent the case back to the first-instance court for a retrial and a new verdict.
