Online casinos have always been at the forefront of technological innovation, constantly finding ways to offer better user experiences and more convenient transaction methods. In recent years, one of the most significant advancements among online casino sites has become the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a payment option.

As such, all eyes, especially of those in the XRP community, will be on the Commission and the crypto company as their actions on the day could potentially determine the next steps that will be taken in the case. 
 
Why November 9 Is Important
 
Following her dismissal order, Judge Anlaisa Torres had set November 9 as the deadline for both parties to jointly propose a briefing schedule with regard to remedies. Basically, Ripple and the Commission need to get back to the Judge on how they intend to proceed with the case. Failure to do this means that the court will have to step in and provide guidance to both parties.
