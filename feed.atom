Government keeps growing, but trust and satisfaction in government institutions continues to decline. 70% of Americans trust the presidency “some or very little” and economic confidence among U.S. adults is –41 on a scale of –100 to 100. 74% of Americans think economic conditions are worsening.

Notably, terra luna classic (LUNC) surged by 122.5% against the dollar, while the BRC20 token ORDI ascended by 118.3%.
 
Alternative Cryptos Gather Double and Triple Digit 7-Day Gains
 
This week witnessed a group of six cryptocurrencies, including LUNC, ORDI, IOTA, TIA, STX, and WEMIX, soaring over 50% in value compared to the dollar. Coinciding with BTC’s climb to levels unseen since the Terra LUNA debacle, LUNC marked a remarkable triple-digit rise of 122.5%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Enter a new realm of cryptocurrencies where Bitcoin plays a major role in cybersecurity and national defense in addition to finances. US Space Force Major Jason Lowery clarifies the surprising significance of Bitcoin by providing a viewpoint that goes beyond money and cents and touches on matters of strategic importance.
 
In a carefully worded letter to the Defense Innovation Board, Major Lowery fervently argues for the strategic use of the crypto and similar proof-of-work (PoW) systems.
 
Lowery makes a strong case for these cryptographic systems, arguing that they have enormous potential and significant strategic ramifications. He calls on the government to start investigating in-depth the range of ways that PoW protocols and Bitcoin could advance defense and innovation projects.

A Breakdown Of Why An XRP ETF Will Be Huge
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, crypto research ABS of the 3T Warrior Academy outlined four reasons why the “inevitable” XRP ETF would be significant. The first reason he gave was the fact this development could attract more institutional investors. He said that an XRP ETF would make it simpler for them to venture into the XRP pool.
 
 
XRP is already seeing an impressive amount of inflows into its ecosystem. That could, however, be more with the help of an XRP ETF.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brazil's financial landscape witnessed a seismic shift as Itaú Unibanco, the nation's largest private bank, announced its foray into the world of cryptocurrency trading Monday, introducing a service that allows its customers to engage in buying and selling Bitcoin and Ether via its ion investment platform.
Marking a significant move for a traditional banking institution, Itau follows newer financial entities like Nubank and BTG Pactual, both of which have integrated such offerings for their clientele. 
Initially, Itaú's customers will have access to trade in Bitcoin and ether, the primary cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. However, the rollout of this service will be gradual, with selective access granted to customers registered with ion, contingent upon regulatory clarity.
Guto Antunes, head of Itaú Digital Assets, emphasized the bank's cautious approach, highlighting that the custody of Bitcoin traded on ion would be managed by Itaú, ensuring asset segregation but withholding access to the private keys of the wallets from platform users.
Notably, he clarified that for the initial phase, external Bitcoin deposits into Itaú accounts and withdrawals to customers' personal digital wallets will not be available.
Instead, the bank pledges the security of its balance sheet to safeguard invested amounts, likening it to the security customers experience when their money remains in a traditional bank account.
Elsewhere, Antunes shed light on Itaú's focus on attracting new customers by offering opportunities in Bitcoin. "We are in a generation that grows up and uses banking in a tokenized way," he said.
Though the move is a significant step, it's one that showcases how traditional banks still equate Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, with the bank here giving no indication of the scrutiny centralized cryptocurrencies are under in the US and other jurisdictions.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-12-04T14:04:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[El Salvador's national Bitcoin treasury is back in the green.
At least, that's the latest data from NayibTracker.com, a website dedicated to following the performance of El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele's decision to invest in Bitcoin in 2021. The website tracks the time and date of known purchases, as well as those that Bukele has pledged to follow through on.
According to the data, the total investment of $127 million has yielded a current value increase of $4 million, translating to a profit of 3.17%.
The data appeared to be confirmed Monday through posts on X by Bukele, who recently stepped down from the presidency to run for reelection.
Still, the bulk of this performance rests on the idea that Bukele followed through on a public commitment to purchase 1 Bitcoin a day since November 17, 2022. If he did, Bitcoin purchased on that date is up 58% since the acquisition.
That said, Bukele has yet to confirm or speak publicly about whether the country acquired an additional 360+ Bitcoin over the last year, in accordance with his announcement it would pursue a dollar cost averaging strategy. Notably, his post today seems to verify the data for the first time.
Elsewhere, the overall investment showcases a mix of gains and losses, with the most significant single-day increase occurring on July 1, 2022, when an investment of $19,000 per Bitcoin resulted in a staggering 119.81% surge in value. 
Conversely, there were moments of decline, such as on November 26, 2021 at a price of over $60,000, a purchase whose value is still down 29.14%.
However, with Bitcoin's price surging above $40,000, and optimism a Bitcoin ETF may be approved in the U.S. soon, industry bulls believe even this purchase will be soon in the black.
As Bitcoin continues to assert its influence on the world stage, El Salvador's journey serves as a noteworthy case study for other countries exploring the intersection of traditional finance and the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptocurrency.]]></summary>

Ethereum
 
Ethereum’s current oscillators present a mixed view. The relative strength index (RSI) at 81.5 suggests neutrality, whereas the Stochastic and commodity channel index (CCI) lean toward a more bearish sentiment. These mixed signals from the oscillators indicate a nuanced market sentiment, with traders potentially weighing the robust performance against possible overvaluation concerns.
