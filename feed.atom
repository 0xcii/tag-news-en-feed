        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the latest announcement from Japanese investment firm Metaplanet Inc., its Bitcoin holdings have surged, rising to 530.717 BTC as of October 3.
 
As revealed by the Tokyo-listed company, this increase in its Bitcoin bags was possible due to a smart options trading strategy, which led to the company earning more BTC and adding it to its portfolio.
 
What Was The Smart Option Strategy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, October 2, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took a formal step in extending the XRP lawsuit with Ripple by filing a Notice of Appeal of Judge Torres’s ruling. This move came on the heels of the final judgment by the US District Court, Southern District of New York on August 7, which the SEC is now contesting.
 
In the notice, the agency does not specify which elements of the case it will appeal. The ambiguity leaves room for speculation whether the SEC will challenge both decisions by Judge Torres, the ruling on programmatic sales of XRP which also clarified that XRP itself is not a security (from July 2023) or the remedies imposed on Ripple’s institutional sales, finalized on August 7.
