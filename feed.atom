Coinbase’s CEO on Cryptocurrency Regulation
 
The CEO of the Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN), Brian Armstrong, has called on Congress to pass clear crypto legislation. He tweeted Wednesday:
 

America risks losing its status as a financial hub long term, with no clear regs on crypto, and a hostile environment from regulators. Congress should act soon to pass clear legislation.

The Devastating Impact Of Dollar Dominance
 
2022 devastated cryptocurrencies and other risk assets due to the seemingly endless dominance of the dollar. The DXY Dollar Currency Index climbed to the highest levels since the inception of Bitcoin. 
 
Because USD is one half of most cryptocurrency trading pairs due to the dollar being the global reserve currency, when the dollar is strong, the other side of the pair weakens. 
 
 
As momentum began to turn down in the DXY, it started to turn up across crypto. The last few months have provided a much needed relief rally across the asset clas…]]></summary>

Dogecoin Social Sentiment Surges To October 2022 Levels
 
Dogecoin’s social sentiment has actually been on an uneven path over the last couple of months. The last time that the digital asset really saw a good surge was back in October of 2022. If you’re wondering why this month is significant, it is because this is the month that billionaire Elon Musk completed his takeover of the social media platform Twitter.

Today, the NBA Hall of Fame player Paul Pierce settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over charges of unlawful touting digital asset EthereumMax, which the regulator considers a ‘crypto security.’
 
This comes after the SEC continues to crack down on the crypto industry. Pierce was charged with the same offense as other celebrities who had something to do with promoting the cash grab scheme supported by the EthereumMax project.  
 
The Offense, The Judgement, And The EthereumMax Lesson 
 
In 2021, NBA legend Pierce promoted EthereumMax tokens. According to the SEC, this is considered an offense as Pierece failed to disclose that he was promoting the token for a profit.

The central bank’s failure to pay its debts on time will likely force the affected financial institutions to similarly delay paying back their own forex-denominated debts.
 
Nigeria’s Declining Oil Revenues
 
Nigeria’s perennial shortage of foreign exchange may likely result in the country’s central bank failing to repay domestic lenders on time, the rating agency Moody’s Investors Service has said. As reported by Bloomberg, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) owes the West African nation’s so-called rated commercial lenders about $10.4 billion which the bank received in the form of swaps and forwards.
