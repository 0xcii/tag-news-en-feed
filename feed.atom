        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-bnb-rebounds-from-1-year-low-shib-surges-higher/"/>
        <updated>2023-08-23T16:05:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BNB was one of Wednesday’s biggest movers, as the token rebounded from a recent one-year low. The price decline came as crypto exchange Binance came under scrutiny for allegedly assisting sanctioned Russian clients in moving funds abroad. Shiba inu also rose, following recent losses.
 
BNB
 
BNB, the native token of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, rose by as much as 4% on Wednesday, following recent declines.
 
After falling to a one-year low of $204.40 on Tuesday, BNB/USD rose to an intraday peak of $216.39 earlier today.
 
Wednesday’s rally in price comes following a recent bear run, which saw the token fall lower for seven of the last nine sessions.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rebounding from a floor at 21.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 29.22, which is marginally below a ceiling at 30.00.
 
In the event that this ceiling is broken, BNB will likely move above $220.00.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Additionally, shiba inu (SHIB) was also a notable gainer in today’s session, as the meme coin recovered from a recent price dive.
 
SHIB/USD slipped to a bottom of $0.000007744 during yesterday’s session, before moving to a high of $0.00000832 on hump-day.
 
The rebound saw shiba inu rise from Tuesday’s breakout below a key price floor of $0.00000790.
 
 
Like with BNB above, the move came as the RSI bounced from a floor of its own around the 40.00 mark, with a current reading of 43.92.
 
As of now, there is a good chance that SHIB bulls are targeting exits around a resistance point of $0.00000885.

Examining the historical data of past Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) could offer valuable insights into the anticipated outcomes, particularly pertinent in the lead-up to the imminent LBank IEO. This practice has gained prominence as both investment stakeholders and project teams exhibit heightened attention towards the performance metrics of tokens enlisted across diverse exchanges.
 
H1 2023 IEO Data across Various Exchanges

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to sit firmly below the $26,000 level on Wednesday, after breaking out of a key price floor. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has mostly consolidated in recent days, as traders await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole this Friday. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin moved below a key price floor late on Tuesday, as the cryptocurrency extended its streak of consolidation.
 
Following an earlier high of $26,160.78, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,520.73 late during yesterday’s session.
 
This resulted in price diving to a five-day low, and below a recent support point at the $25,600 level.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
As of writing, bitcoin has since rebounded and is currently trading at $25,870.08, with the relative strength index (RSI) hovering around a floor of its own at 20.00.
 
Price strength now sits at 19.82, which remains in the depths of a bear zone, however, it also acts as a positive for longer-term bulls, as sentiment appears to have already found a bottom.
 
Friday’s Jackson Hole Symposium could provide a spark that markets have been missing in recent days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) briefly fell under the $1,600 level yesterday. However, price has gone on to recover in today’s session.
 
ETH/USD bottomed out at $1,596.38 on Tuesday, following a peak of $1,662.88 earlier in the day.
 
Similar to bitcoin, this drop pushed ethereum to its lowest point since last Thursday, which is when markets reacted to the Spacex news.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
ETH is now trading at $1,637, and comes as the RSI bounced from a support level of 22.00, and has now moved to 23.19.
 
The 27.00 mark remains the target for bulls currently in the market, with a collision likely to result in ETH rising above $1,700.

It seems likely that the comment was, at least in a way, meant to be derogatory. Perhaps this is because so few people actually understand what Bitcoin even is. Just the mention of cryptocurrency will make the majority of people roll their eyes at the scandal-ridden, casino-like and often-fraudulent topic. So, it begs the question, are they wrong? 
Unfortunately, there is more nuance in the answer than most Americans have patience for. The problem with lumping bitcoin in with cryptocurrency is that the vast majority of people cannot identify the difference between bitcoin and any other coin. …]]></summary>
