Large Shiba Inu Investors Have Been Participating In Accumulation Recently
 
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the large SHIB holders have gone on a buying spree the past week. The “large holders” here refer to the combined cohort of addresses holding between 0.1% and 1% of the circulating supply and those holding above 1% of the supply.
 
The former group comprises the sizeable holders that IntoTheBlock refers to as “investors.” At the same time, the latter cohort includes the whales, the largest and most powerful entities on the network.
 
As the large holders carry a significant part of the total supply in their wallets, they can ha…]]></summary>

Discussion of mempool or policy (the non-consensus rules around Bitcoin nodes communicating with one another) often falls to the background. However, with recent high transaction volume and launch of various NFT and token projects/platforms and the accompanying feerate spike, mempool and policy came to the forefront.
User of Inscriptions and other protocols ran into issues with standardness policy rules, leading many to question their purpose and look for ways to remove or subvert them. Regular Bitcoin users ran into issues with fees or bumping fees. In an effort to educate and en…]]></summary>

In that now-famous article, penned for The New York Times on September 7, 2011, Krugman criticized and dismissed the cryptocurrency, which was then trading at an average of $7.03 per Bitcoin across exchanges. 
Fast forward to today, and Bitcoin's remarkable journey has proven Krugman's skepticism to be one of the most costly missed opportunities in financial history, as demonstrated by the reaction to an X post today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo.
When Krugman's article was published, Bitcoin was still in its infancy. The digital money, created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, had only been around for a couple of years. It was largely unknown to the mai…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-shib-hovers-higher-despite-market-consolidation/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-06T15:34:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was a notable gainer in today’s session, as the cryptocurrency rose for a second straight session. The global market cap is marginally higher at the time of writing, as prices mostly consolidated. Solana retreated from a near one-week high.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was in the green for a second session running, following a bounce from a recent point of support.
 
Price rallied to a peak of $0.000007757 earlier in the day, which comes after Tuesday’s low at $0.0000076.
 
As referenced earlier, the surge occurred after SHIB bears rejected a breakout below a price floor at the $0.00000735 mark.
 
 
This came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also avoided a drop of its own, near support of 35.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 39.07, with the next point of resistance around 43.00.
 
Should bulls manage to push the price closer to the aforementioned zone, there is a good chance SHIB can climb over $0.00000800.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
After trading close to a one-week high earlier in the session, solana (SOL) retreated from this point, falling under $20.00 in the process.
 
SOL/USD moved to a bottom at $19.41 on Wednesday, a day after it hit an intraday high of $20.55.
 
The decline sees solana now on the cusp of colliding with a support point at the $19.00 mark, which has been the floor for the past two months.
 
 
Today’s downtrend came as the RSI was unable to break out of a resistance zone of 44.00, falling to a current reading of 38.97 instead.
 
In the event that momentum remains bearish in the coming days, a target of 36.00 could act as a level of stability.

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/valkyrie-cio-bitcoin-spot-etf-q1-2024"/>
        <updated>2023-09-06T14:57:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a new interview with Bloomberg, Steven McClurg, the CIO of Valkyrie Investments, predicts that a Bitcoin spot ETF could become a reality by Q1 2024, potentially marking a significant milestone for the crypto industry. 
Further, he indicated there is a "50%" chance a Bitcoin ETF is approved in October, the earliest that such a fund could pass evaluation by the SEC.

Elsewhere, the discussion revolved around the ongoing efforts by several financial institutions and asset managers to launch a Bitcoin ETF in the United States. While Canada and other countries have already embraced crypto ETFs, the U.S. has been slower to approve such products, primarily due to regulatory concerns.
McClurg believes that the growing acceptance and understanding of cryptocurrencies among regulators and institutional investors will pave the way for a Bitcoin spot ETF in the near future. He points out that the SEC has been actively engaging with the crypto industry to establish clear guidelines for these financial products.
The potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF could open doors for a broader range of investors to gain exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. 
Currently, U.S. investors can access Bitcoin through various investment trusts and futures contracts, but a spot ETF would provide a more direct and convenient investment vehicle. 
McClurg predicted that the market for Bitcoin could "10x" on the back of institutional investment from pension funds and other professional money managers.
The interview also touched on the broader implications of a Bitcoin spot ETF. It could potentially attract more institutional money into the market, driving liquidity. 
However, McClurg acknowledges that regulatory hurdles must be cleared before a Bitcoin spot ETF can become a reality. The SEC has expressed concerns about market manipulation, custody solutions, and investor protection. 
Valkyrie is one of over 10 firms that have currently filed with the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-06T12:46:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was largely unchanged on Wednesday, as moving averages closed in on a potential upward crossover. The potential for a “death cross” will likely be in the mind of would-be bulls, looking for an opportune time to reenter. Ethereum continues to hover close to a floor of $1,630.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin’s consolidation continued on Wednesday, as bulls remained on the sidelines, despite the prospect of a “death cross.”
 
The term refers to an entangling between moving averages, in this instance the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) trendlines.
 
Despite the potential for this to occur, BTC/USD bottomed out at $25,628.61, which is marginally lower than Tuesday’s high of $25,858.37.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Looking at the chart, price consolidation comes as the relative strength index (RSI), flatlines close to a support of its own at 35.00.
 
Bulls have so far rejected a move below this point, however in the event that this occurs, BTC could fall below $25,000.
 
Longer-term bitcoiners could be hoping for this, as a means of buying at an even lower rate.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) remained close to the $1,630 level during today’s session, despite attempts by bears to force a breakout below $1,600.
 
ETH/USD has climbed away from an earlier low of $1,610.14 on Wednesday, with price going on to peak at $1,635.29.
 
Similar to bitcoin, the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages seem set for an imminent upwards cross, however price has yet to react to the prospect.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Ethereum’s price strength now sits at a reading of 36.80, marginally above a floor of 36.00, however a ceiling of 44.00 is likely the real target for traders.
 
Should a reversal happen in the coming days, a move to this point of resistance will be enough to send ETH past $1,700.
