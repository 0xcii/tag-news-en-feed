        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The head of the State Duma finance committee reportedly said Russia will legalize the use of cryptocurrency for international trade in January 2023.
Russia’s Congressional finance committee chairman, Anatoly Aksakov, said the country is moving to greenlight international trade in cryptocurrency within the next month, according to a report by national news agency TASS.
"In January, we want to legalize cryptocurrencies to ensure foreign trade activities," Aksakov said, per a translated version of the report.
The chairman highlighted that although Russia is taking steps to allow bitcoin and cryptocurrency payments for imports, there are no plans to encourage similar usage of the burgeoning assets within the boundaries of the nation’s territory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reviewing select developments emerging from Ethiopia this past year makes it clear that the stage is set for Bitcoin.
This is an opinion editorial by Kal Kassa, an Ethiopian Bitcoiner.
2022 was an exciting year for the global Bitcoin community, and particularly African Bitcoiners. With a large population that is much younger than many other continents, the 54 countries of Africa are increasingly primed for Bitcoin with a growing arsenal of educators, advocates and developers. 
As we look toward the future of what is possible with sovereign money, especially in the areas of the world that can benefit most, it’s helpful to review some of the news and highlights to come out of Ethiopia, a country that could emerge as one of the leaders in Bitcoin adoption and innovation in the year to come.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-eth-nears-1230-resistance-following-strong-us-gdp-data/"/>
        <updated>2022-12-23T13:36:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum edged closer to a key resistance level of $1,230 on Dec. 23, as markets continued to react to better than expected U.S. GDP data. Gross domestic product in the United States was revised higher to 3.2%, better than the 2.9% expected. Bitcoin mostly consolidated in today’s session, with prices trading near the $16,800 mark.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was once again in consolidation on Friday, as markets continued to react to the latest U.S. Q3 GDP figures.
 
Following a low of $16,592.41 on Thursday, BTC/USD was marginally higher, with prices rising to a peak of $16,880.87 in today’s session.
 
The surge in price pushed BTC above a key resistance point of $16,800, as bulls once again attempted to recapture the $17,000 mark.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, recent price uncertainty comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) remains close to a floor at 45.00.
 
Sentiment also seems uncertain following a recent crossover between the red 10-day moving average, and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
If this downward trend continues, we could see BTC trading near $16,000 during the Christmas weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was marginally higher to end the week, as prices moved closer to a key resistance level earlier today.
 
ETH/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1,224.21 in Friday’s session, less than 24 hours after hovering at $1,187.13.
 
Today’s move sees ETH bulls once again try to break out of the long-term resistance level of $1,230.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 14-day RSI is now rallying above a resistance point at 47.00, and tracking at 47.92, with the next visible ceiling at 52.00
 
In order for bulls to continue to push ethereum higher, price strength will likely need to surge towards this upcoming resistance of 52.00.

On the evening of December 19, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced it had increased its cap on 10-year bond yields from 0.25% to 0.5%, while keeping short- and long-term interest rates unchanged. 



Link to embedded tweet.
The cap at the 0.25% level had been suppressing global bond markets with the use of an unlimited money printer for Japanese debt. This in turn caused a significant deterioration of the yen against the dollar, while the BOJ used its immense pile of Treasurys to occasionally defend the currency against speculators.
