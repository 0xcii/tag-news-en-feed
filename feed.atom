        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent developments, Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, has faced a series of challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and legal battles, leading to significant cost-cutting measures. As the company undergoes a federal crackdown in the United States, it has decided to reduce its workforce, resulting in layoffs of over 1,000 employees. However, it appears that layoffs are not the only cost-cutting measures being implemented at Binance.
 
An internal email leaked by Adam Cochran from Cinneamhain Ventures has shed light on the cost-saving measures being taken by Binance. Cochran in a  Twitter thread, questions CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, for not disclosing the true reasons behind the layoffs.
 
The email reveals that the layoffs were indeed a result of cost reduction and the impac…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-17T19:39:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aave, a prominent lending protocol within the decentralized finance (defi) sphere, has unveiled GHO, a new stablecoin, which is now live on the Ethereum network. Aave users can now mint the stablecoin asset by leveraging Aave version three (v3).
 
Aave’s Dollar-Pegged GHO Token Goes Live on Ethereum
 
This week, on July 14, 2023, Aave’s community approved a governance proposal, swiftly followed by the much-awaited launch of the stablecoin GHO on the Ethereum network. GHO, initially announced in July 2022, had a test run on Ethereum’s Goerli testnet in February 2023. In line with the information from the Github repository, the newly debuted stablecoin, and its affiliated smart contract underwent multiple audits.
 
Currently, GHO is relatively insignificant when compared with the top ten heavyweights of the stablecoin world, especially when considering circulating dollar-pegged coins. The circulating supply of GHO stands around 2,510,269 tokens, representing a meager 0.0016% of the overall $127 billion stablecoin economy. At 12:20 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, GHO hit a trough at $0.9813, yet so far, it has generally maintained its peg to the dollar.
 
 
Emulating numerous stablecoin assets, individuals can gather interest with Aave’s freshly debuted GHO stablecoin. Users who stake the AAVE token are also rewarded with an extra 30% discount on current GHO borrowing rates. Thus far, there are approximately 234 GHO holders, and since the mainnet inception, a total of 893 transactions have been logged. Data sourced from coinmarketcap.com reveals that GHO has seen roughly $1,437,756 in worldwide trading volume over the past 24 hours.

The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency sector. The metric uses a scale that runs from 0-100 for representing this sentiment.
 
When the value of the index is lower than 46, it means that the investors are fearful right now. On the other hand, values above 54 suggest that the market is greedy at the moment. The region between these two thresholds of 46 and 54 belongs to the neutral sentiment.

Data illustrates an intensified dedication of hashrate to the Litecoin blockchain as the critical halving deadline draws near.
 
Litecoin Reward Halving Draws Near
 
Over the last two weeks, litecoin (LTC) has seen a notable descent, depreciating approximately 17% in value against the U.S. dollar. However, casting the gaze back a full month reveals a contrasting picture, with LTC capturing a gain of roughly 18%. In just 15 days, the Litecoin network stands on the precipice of its third halving.

Whale Deposits $3.88 Million In 1inch To Binance
 
On-chain data tracker Lookonchain, on Monday, flagged a transaction that could negatively affect 1inch’s current price rally. The transaction was made by a whale carrying a total of 7 million 1inch tokens.
 
 
Now, such transactions are not out of the ordinary given that whales tend to move their coins around a lot. However, what is of concern here is the destination of the coins.

Alderoty revealed that Ripple plans to initiate discussions with U.S.-based financial firms in the coming quarter regarding the adoption of the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, which utilizes XRP as a bridge between fiat currencies for seamless cross-border payments.
