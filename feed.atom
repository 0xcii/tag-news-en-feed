        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin and the entire crypto market find themselves at a pivotal moment following several weeks of fluctuating price action. As analysts and investors keep a close eye on market trends, many are optimistic about a potential rally in the coming months. A significant factor influencing this sentiment is the recent entry of US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into the market, which often signal the involvement of institutional money and traditional investors.
 
 
According to key data from Glassnode, US spot ETFs currently hold 4.6% of the total Bitcoin supply, translating to an impressive valuation of approximately $58 billion. This growing presence of institutional capital not only adds credibility to BTC but also suggests a potential for increased price stability and upward momentum.

This represents a fresh setback for the “king of altcoins,” which has not had a particularly positive performance in the past few months. Interestingly, a popular crypto pundit on X has come forward with an on-chain observation into the behavior of Ethereum investors over the last quarter.

While some analysts and investors are anticipating a massive rally in the coming months, key data indicates that the market may not be ready for a breakout just yet. 
 
Recent on-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals that miners are offloading BTC, with their reserves showing a noticeable decline. This suggests that selling pressure from miners could be contributing to the current slowdown.
 
 
Despite the optimism for a future rally, the combination of recent price action and on-chain indicators implies that Bitcoin’s much-anticipated upward surge may still take time to materialize. As the crypto market remains uncertain, traders are watching closely for signs of wh…]]></summary>
