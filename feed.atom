Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Been Moving Opposite To Price Recently
 
As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, a bearish divergence has been brewing in the Bitcoin short-term holder SOPR recently. The “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR) indicates whether Bitcoin investors are selling at a profit or at a loss right now.
 
When the value of this metric is less than 1, it means that the average holder in the sector is transferring their coins on the blockchain at a net amount of loss currently. On the other hand, values under the threshold imply profit-taking is the dominant form of selling among the investors.
