The exchange balance, a measure of the total amount of Bitcoin sitting in the wallets of centralized exchanges, has often been a hot topic in the on-chain analysis community.
 
 
Investors use these platforms for selling-related purposes, so many look at the exchange balance as a sort of reflection of the “available” trade supply of the cryptocurrency.
 
In recent years, an interesting pattern has emerged in this supply sitting on the exchanges, with its value observing a constant decline. This suggested that investors were continuously taking coins out, thus decreasing the a…]]></summary>

These factors are shaping the economic space for companies validating Bitcoin transactions and could potentially force some into selling their digital assets prematurely to remain solvent, according to Kaiko Research.
 
 
Diminishing Rewards And Revenue Pressures
 
Kaiko Research has pointed out this worrying trend for Bitcoin miners: the combination of reduced mining rewards and lower network fees is increasingly challenging their profitability. Since April, when the reward for mining a Bitcoin block was cut from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, revenue has plummeted.

Not everyone is convinced that the uptrend will last, at least based on on-chain activities. Taking to X, one analyst pointed to developments in the Bitcoin spent volume lifespan chart. There, the analyst noted a 10X increase in BTC movements compared to previous highs. 
 
 
The massive influx, amounting to a staggering $9 billion, coincides with Mt. Gox’s planned user compensation in July, initially slated for October. The analyst says the concern with this deluge is that it could trigger a sell-off, further driving prices down.
