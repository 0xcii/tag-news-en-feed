SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Issues Dissenting Opinion
U.S. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, also known in cryptocurrency circles as “crypto mom,” has written a letter blasting the recent decision of the Commission to amend the definition of “exchange” under the Exchange Act Rule.

In addition to Bremmer’s comments, economist Paul Krugman also asserted in a recent op-ed that the greenback isn’t going away anytime soon and called some of the speculators “‘Weimarists,’ people who are always predicting hyperinflation.”

When the value of this metric is negative, it means BTC is currently responding to movements in the price of Gold by traveling in the opposite direction. On the other hand, positive values of the indicator imply the two assets are moving in a similar trajectory right now.
