        <updated>2023-08-09T16:13:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Bloomberg article, citing “people familiar with the case,” reveals that FTX’s co-CEO Ryan Salame is allegedly in talks with prosecutors, and a plea agreement could be forthcoming. Insiders also emphasize that Salame’s privately owned aircraft may be surrendered as part of the suspected plea deal.
 
Private Jet on the Bargaining Table as FTX’s Salame Discusses Plea Deal
 
Bloomberg’s Ava Benny-Morrison quotes sources who say Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX, could be negotiating a settlement with federal prosecutors concerning the collapse of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange.
 
Individuals in the know stated that Salame might enter a plea agreement as early as the upcoming month. Former FTX leader Sam Bankman-Fried is scheduled for trial in October after pleading not guilty to the charges against him.
 
Several colleagues have already reached plea agreements with federal prosecutors, including FTX co-founder Gary Wang, former FTX director of engineering Nishad Singh, and ex-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison.
 
In late April, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents searched Salame’s Maryland residence and confiscated his cell phone. Reports also indicate that Salame snitched on Bankman-Fried days before FTX declared bankruptcy.
 
 
The report by Benny-Morrison further specifies that prosecutors aim to confiscate some luxury assets acquired by FTX senior staff during the company’s peak. Sources mentioned by Benny-Morrison reveal that law enforcement is keen on having Salame forfeit his private jet.
 
These individuals indicated that the aircraft may play a role in the plea bargain negotiations. The report noted that messages seeking comment from Salame’s lawyers were not immediately returned.
 
How do you perceive the potential forfeiture of luxury assets, including Salame’s private jet, in the ongoing legal saga surrounding FTX’s collapse? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.]]></summary>

Novogratz invoked the hit song “Tubthumping” by Chumbawamba to illustrate the unyielding spirit of the crypto community. 
 
He quoted, highlighting the ethos that has driven the evolution of cryptocurrencies:
 
 
“I get knocked down, but I get up again.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu rose by as much as 10% during today’s session, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. The meme coin climbed to its highest point this week, with the global crypto market cap up nearly 2% as of writing. Solana was another big gainer, hitting a ten-day high on Wednesday.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was one of Wednesday’s notable movers, as the meme coin rose by over 10% during the day.
 
Following a low of $0.000009027 on Tuesday, SHIB/USD rallied to an intraday peak at $0.00001002 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the second straight price rise for SHIB, and it has pushed the coin to its highest level since Sunday.
 
 
As a result of the surge in momentum, the 14–day relative strength index (RSI) has now collided with a ceiling at 66.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 65.67, with shiba inu also falling from its previous high.
 
SHIB/USD is now trading at $0.000009749.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) remained in the green for a third consecutive session, as it continued its push towards $25.00.
 
SOL/USD jumped to a high of $24.91 on Wednesday, a day after falling to a bottom at the $23.21 level.
 
Overall, this saw the cryptocurrency climb to a ten-day high, and close in on a collision with the $25.00 ceiling.
 
 
This comes as the price strength nears its own resistance point at 60.00. It is currently reading at 58.27.
 
In the event it hits the 60.00 zone, there is a strong possibility solana will be trading above $25.00.

seen a spectacular boom in cryptocurrencies in recent years, altering the  
financial environment. Traditional bitcoin mining, on the other hand, has  
prompted worries about sustainability and energy use. As a result of these  
issues, a new wave of sustainable cryptocurrencies has developed, with the goal  
of revolutionizing the digital asset industry. 
The  
Environmental Problem
To confirm  
transactions and secure the network, traditional cryptocurrencies such as  
Bitcoin rely on energy-intensive mining procedures. As a result, these  
operations demand a large quantity of electricity, resulting in an increase in  
carbon emissions. This has spurred discussions about the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved above $30,000 late on Tuesday, as markets reacted to the news that rating agency Moody’s had downgraded several U.S. banks. The list includes State Street, Northern Trust, and Bank of New York Mellon. Ethereum was marginally higher.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) briefly rose back above the $30,000 level late last night, as markets reacted to the Moody’s downgrade of several U.S. small and mid-sized banks.
 
Following a low of $29,261.66 earlier in the day, BTC/USD raced to a high of $30,176.80 as the session matured.
 
This was the highest point bitcoin had hit since July 20, when the price peaked at a level of $30,421.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Previous gains have since slipped, and as of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $29,791.72.
 
On a technical front, one of the catalysts of the move appeared to be a breakout which took place at the 52.00 resistance level on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
The RSI is now tracking at 55.39, with a ceiling at 57.00 upcoming.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Although ethereum (ETH) was also higher, its own gains were somewhat muted, in comparison to those of BTC.
 
ETH/USD peaked at the $1,873.85 level yesterday, which came after an earlier drop to a low of $1,831.08.
 
The move pushed ethereum to its strongest level since last Wednesday, however it was not enough to send the price back above $1,900.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This latest rally also led to price strength colliding with a resistance point at 50.00, where it continues to sit at present.
 
In order to make a leap towards the $1,900 zone, this ceiling on the RSI will first need to be broken.
