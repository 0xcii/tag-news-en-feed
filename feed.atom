        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/coinbase-adopts-apple-pay-for-crypto-purchases-amid-market-slowdown/"/>
        <updated>2024-04-10T14:01:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To facilitate cryptocurrency purchases for United  
Kingdom-based users, the crypto exchange Coinbase has announced the integration  
of Apple Pay functionality. This development allows users to buy Bitcoin and  
other digital assets directly through their iPhones using the Apple Pay  
feature.
Implementing Apple Pay Feature for Safer Transactions
According to Coinbase, enabling Apple Pay provides users  
with a "more secure and private" method of purchasing  
cryptocurrencies. The exchange emphasized that when transactions are made using  
Apple Pay, card numbers are not stored on the device or Apple servers. Instead,  
a unique device account number is assigned, encrypted, and stored in a chip  
designed for securing payment information.
This integration arrives at a time when the cryptocurrency  
market is experiencing a slowdown in trading volume and retail interest.  
Coinbase recently reported decreasing crypto volumes as the market seeks new  
narratives to drive prices higher. While the upcoming Bitcoin halving event  
could potentially spark price increases, the exchange acknowledged the  
challenge of navigating a historically weak period for risky assets like  
crypto.
Crypto Social Media Engagement Wanes Despite Market Buzz
Beyond trading volume, social media engagement data also  
indicates subdued retail interest in cryptocurrencies. LunarCrush, a social  
analytics platform, observed fewer posts related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and  
other cryptocurrencies on social media platforms. CEO Joe Vezzani noted that  
social interactions within the crypto space are currently lower compared to  
previous bull markets, even after accounting for spam and bot activity.

Ripple CTO On Naming Controversy
 
Both XRP and Ripple have similar pasts; XRP was once known as “ripples” before taking on its current configuration. Due to this, both parties are sometimes mistaken as one, leading to constant confusion within the entire cryptocurrency community over time.
 
 
Initially, the recent debate around the company’s and XRP naming which originated from the X (formerly Twitter) platform was triggered by popular Australlian-based attorney Bill Morgan. The lawyer brought the community’s attention to a situation where the A…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appears to be approaching a critical balance point after a period of significant outflows, according to Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale Investments. In an exclusive interview with Reuters on the latest episode of Inside ETFs, Sonnenshein delved into the challenges and transformations faced by the GBTC.
 
Grayscale Investments has been at the forefront of the crypto asset management sector since 2013. The firm encountered heightened competition as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlit spot Bitcoin ETF products from nine other issuers on January 11, ending a prolonged standoff with the crypto industry. This regulatory milestone opened the gates for a variety of investment products, putting Grayscale’s dominance to the test.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 10, 2024
  
  
  
The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has expedited the approval process, positioning Hong Kong as a pioneer in Asia's Bitcoin ETF space. The move comes ahead of industry expectations for launches later this year.
Multiple Chinese financial institutions, including the Hong Kong subsidiaries of Harvest Fund and China Southern Fund, have applied for bitcoin ETFs recently. Spot bitcoin ETFs provide exposure to actual bitcoin rather than derivatives.
According to sources, the SFC will announce its first approved batch of spot bitcoin ETFs on April 15. After approvals, the funds can then be applied to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which is expected to take 10 days.
This accelerated timeline demonstrates Hong Kong's proactive approach in enhancing its appeal as a global financial hub. It also builds on the city's Bitcoin-friendly stance, including granting crypto exchange Hashkey a retail trading license last year.
The news comes after the tremendous success of spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States after approval this January, which attracted over $12 billion in inflows. As the first Asian jurisdiction to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, Hong Kong is paving the way for potential launches in other markets.
Accessible Bitcoin investment products have seen rapid growth in demand among both institutional and retail investors. By leveraging its regulatory framework to meet this appetite, Hong Kong cements its position as a rising Bitcoin hub in Asia.]]></summary>
