The past day saw bitcoin’s price range fluctuate between $41,804 and $45,813 with a market capitalization of $832 billion and trading volume of around $35.96 billion.

industry to continue their dynamic development. Among them was Bitget, the  
crypto exchange that celebrated its fifth anniversary and expanded  
significantly across several key metrics.
Gracy Chen,  
the Managing Director of Bitget, published an open letter in which she  
summarized the increase in spot volumes, employment growth, and the acquisition  
of a record number of clients, as well as outlined the exchange's plans for  
2024.
Bitget’s Spot Trading  
Volumes Surge 94%
Although  
Bitget originally focused on crypto derivatives, the company reopened its spot  
markets in 2021. This strategic move paid dividends in 2023, with spot trading  
volumes rising 94% year-over-year.
