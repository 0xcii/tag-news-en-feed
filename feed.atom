Chainlink Large Transactions Volume Has Spiked Recently
 
As pointed out by analyst Ali in a post on X, LINK has recently observed a burst of activity on its network. The indicator of interest here is the “large transactions volume,” which measures the aggregate amount of Chainlink being moved in transfers worth at least $100,000 in value.
 
Generally, the only investors who make such large transactions regularly are the whales and institutional investors, so this indicator can provide us with hints about the total activity that these holders are displaying right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana neared the $20.00 level on Monday, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets to start the week. The rise in momentum comes as focus shifts to the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Bitcoin cash was another notable gainer today.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana bulls pushed the token towards the $20.00 level on Monday, as markets geared up for a key week of U.S. economic data.
 
SOL/USD peaked at $19.95 to start the week, which comes following a low of $18.65 the day prior.
 
This surge in price pushed solana to its strongest level since September 8 when price was last above $20.00.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose above a key ceiling at the 49.00 mark.
 
The index is currently tracking at the 50.45 mark at the time of writing, with the next visible ceiling at 53.00
 
In the event price strength rallies beyond this point, SOL will likely be tracking around $20.50.
 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Another big mover on Monday was bitcoin cash (BCH), which surged by as much as 5% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $205.78 on Sunday, BCH/USD rallied to an intraday high of $221.88 to start the week.
 
As a result of the move, bitcoin cash briefly broke out of a ceiling at $222.00, hitting a three-week high in the process.
 
 
This surge has pushed price strength to a collision with a resistance level of its own, at the 60.00 mark.
 
The index is tracking marginally above this point at 61.44, which is the highest area it has hit since July.
 
Should it continue to move past the aforementioned ceiling, there is a chance that BCH will near $240.00 in the coming days.

growing environment of CBDCs and forecast what the future holds. We look at the  
current stage of CBDC development, the forces driving its evolution, and the  
next steps.
The Origins  
of CBDCs
CBDCs have  
formed in response to the volatile financial environment, which has been  
largely affected by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Central banks issue and  
oversee digital currencies, giving a modernized alternative to physical cash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Casey Rodarmor, the creator of the Ordinals protocol, made a surprising return to the public eye during the Ordinals Summit held in Singapore this week.   
The appearance marks Rodarmor's first public engagement in months, following a period of isolation after the protocol's launch in January of this year. He previously broke his silence most recently with a lengthy podcast in which he aired his concerns about Paul Storzc's drivechains upgrade proposal.
The Ordinals Summit, a gathering of NFT enthusiasts, was a notable celebration of the protocol at a time when its use has seemingly declined. The software, which allows digital artifacts to be traded like NFTs on the Bitcoin network, had previously garnered significant attention and praise from collectors and earned criticism for breaking crypto's rigid cultural lines.
The growing popularity of the Ordinals protocol among NFT collectors had taken Rodarmor by surprise. It gained traction rapidly, filling a niche in the market for Bitcoin enthusiasts who wished to participate in the NFT space. However, this success also drew the ire of some Bitcoin proponents who were staunchly against NFTs, though the reasons for the critiques varied from moral to technical objections.
In response to this polarized reaction, Rodarmor chose to step back from the limelight temporarily, focusing on refining the Ordinals protocol. Last week marked a notable change with Rodarmor merging an upgrade that helps more clearly establish provenance for the inscriptions that comprise a specific collection.
In his keynote address, he expressed gratitude for the support the community had shown and emphasized the need for innovation within the cryptocurrency space.
The Ordinals Summit was attended by a diverse range of developers and enthusiasts, all keen to explore the potential of the Ordinals protocol and its impact on the future of NFTs. Notable speakers included Udi Wertheimer, creator of the Taproot Wizards NFT project and, Domo, the pseudonymous creator of the BRC-20 protocol.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After capturing $66.5 billion in May, decentralized exchange (dex) trade volumes have fallen for four consecutive months, with August statistics reaching a 2023 low of $41.7 billion. Metrics for the first half of September do not show improvement, with decentralized exchange trade volumes at about $16.96 billion as of September 18, 2023. 
 
Dex Volumes Nosedive 37% Post-May
 
Dex trade volumes have fallen significantly over the past four months. Data indicate that March saw the year’s highest dex trade volume at $112 billion. In April, volumes declined by 47.26% to $59.06 billion.
 
May experienced a 12.59% increase, with trade volumes rising to $66.5 billion; of that amount, Uniswap’s dex trades contributed $33.67 billion. Since May, however, dex trade volume has declined by 37.29%.
 

 
August data indicate dex trade volume at $41.7 billion, with $24.87 billion, or 59.64%, coming from Uniswap trades. Pancakeswap saw $6.76 billion in trades, while Curve Finance contributed $3.79 billion.
 
Those three dex protocols totaled $35.42 billion in August, making up 84.94% of the month’s global dex volumes. Although September isn’t finished, its dex volumes to date already appear lackluster.
 
As of September 18, 2023, the global dex trade volume stands at $16.96 billion. Approximately $10.27 billion of that total comes from Uniswap trades, about $3.14 billion from PancakeSwap, and $1.07 billion from Curve.
 
 
With only 12 days remaining in September, dex trade volumes might finish below August’s numbers. The data is further highlighted in a monthly crypto recap report by the digital asset manager Vaneck, which indicated a decline in August’s onchain economic activity tied to decentralized finance (defi).
 
“Decentralized exchange volume experienced a more severe decline,” wrote Matthew Sigel, Vaneck’s head of Digital Assets Research.

However, while Shibarium seems to be doing well, this hasn’t really translated into a steady growth in the price of SHIB, leading to sporadic FUD and concerns from the project. 
 
In response to these growing concerns, Lucie, a prominent member of Shiba Inu’s development team and content marketer, took to social media platform X to calm the waters.

In the tweet, Lucie noted that she had received many direct messages from concerned community members concerning Shiba Inu. But Lucie assured the community that these are mostly propelled by SHIB pessimists looking to promote their projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin pushed past the $27,000 level on Monday, as markets prepared for the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Bullish sentiment was in full force in today’s session, despite the prospect of yet another rate hike. Ethereum was also higher to start the week.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin surged to a multi-week high on Monday, as traders began to anticipate the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.
 
BTC/USD rallied to an intraday high of $27,222.98 earlier in today’s session, following a low of $26,415.52 the day prior.
 
As a result of the move, bitcoin climbed to its strongest point since August 31, when price peaked at $27,576.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Despite the rise in momentum, bulls may not be satisfied, and are likely targeting a ceiling at the $28,000 mark.
 
Monday’s gain comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped past a ceiling of 53.00, and is now residing at 58.25.
 
A resistance level of 60.00 will likely be the next major target for bulls currently in the market.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also moved higher to start the week, as traders rejected a breakout below the $1,600 point.
 
Following a low of $1,609.96 on Sunday, ETH/USD rose to an intraday high of $1,653.07 earlier in the day.
 
This has resulted in ethereum surging to its highest point in the past ten days, closing in on a recent resistance of $1,660 in the process.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Although price strength in ETH has also surpassed an obstacle of its own, it is on the cusp of colliding with another at the 50.00 mark. The index currently sits at a reading of 49.61.
 
It is likely that a breakout above this mark could lead ETH back above $1,700.

In his latest YouTube video, Pizzino emphasized that the cryptocurrency market is displaying compelling signs of strength and the potential for significant growth. While crypto markets can be notoriously unpredictable, Pizzino believes that the alpha coin is primed for an impressive uptrend.
