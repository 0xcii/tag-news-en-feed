Fintechs Solving Fundamental Problems
 
According to the findings of a study on Kenya’s startup space, fintech ventures alone accounted for just over 30% or 93 out of the 308 tracked startups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Huobi Token (HT) appears to be in a vulnerable state as it continues to deal with the drama that is happening within the Huobi cryptocurrency exchange.
 
While the crypto hiked its trading price by 3.2% during the last 24 hours to trade at $4.72 at the time of this writing according to tracking from Coingecko, the digital asset continues to struggle to regain some of its recent looses.
 
Over the previous seven and 14 days, HT has squandered 6.4% and 11.3% of its value, respectively, and is on the verge of another meltdown as suggested by some of its technical indicators.
 
The altcoin ended up being in an oversold position, making it more susceptible to a significant price decline which might come within the next few days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana, the touted “Ethereum killer,” has sustained losses in the past few months because of the bear market and its ties to Sam Bankman-Fried’s now-defunct crypto exchange FTX. But recently, the troubled ecosystem surpassed Shiba Inu and Tron in terms of market valuation. 
 
As of writing, SOL still held this advantage according to data from CoinMarketCap. This bullish action caused the crypto’s price to jump 0.9% in the daily timeframe, further beefing up its 36% increase in the past week.
 
 
Catalysts Of This Year’s Solana Rise
 
Solana has been on a roll recently because of two primary catalysts: Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, recently tweeted about the troubled ecosystem, saying now that “opportunistic money people” are gone from the platform, and Solana has a bright futur…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A top Internal Revenue Service (IRS) official says, “Cryptocurrency is here to stay,” and “it’s becoming more legitimate.” The official added that the U.S. tax authority is looking to partner with crypto companies, noting: “I don’t see how we can operate in this space without it.”
 
Top IRS Official Says Crypto Is Here to Stay
 
Thomas Fattorusso, acting special agent-in-charge of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI)’s New York office, talked about cryptocurrency in an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this week.
 
“We can’t be hostile to the technology. We have to embrace it,” the IRS official emphasized, elaborating:
 

Cryptocurrency is here to stay. As far as I’m concerned, it isn’t going anywhere anytime soon and it’s becoming more legitimate. As the years roll on, it becomes more sophisticated.
 
Fattorusso explained that the IRS is looking to partner with crypto companies. “My thought is that those relationships will develop as the years go on and [as] the companies become more comfortable with dealing with the federal government. I don’t see how we can operate in this space without it,” he opined.
 
Commenting on the IRS cooperating and partnering with crypto firms, Fattorusso shared:
 

That’s something that we’re always working toward … that’s always the end goal — to have those partnerships and to have a relationship that isn’t contentious, more of a symbiotic relationship.
 
He believes that partnering with federal agencies “helps them [crypto companies] in their legitimacy.” The IRS official added: “This is a new industry for everybody. I think we’re still trying to feel our way around it. The companies are feeling their way around it.”
 
In November last year, IRS Criminal Investigation chief Jim Lee said that the tax authority is building “hundreds” of crypto cases.
