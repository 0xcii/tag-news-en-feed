        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon climbed to a multi-week high on Friday, as bearish sentiment in cryptocurrency markets began to fade. The global crypto market marginally rose during today’s session, following yesterday’s downturn. XRP was another notable gainer.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was one of Friday’s big movers, as the token rose to a multi-week high during the day.
 
Following a low of $0.8802 on Thursday, MATIC/USD hit an intraday high of $0.9514 during today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, polygon recorded its strongest point since May 8, breaking out of a key resistance of $0.9500 in the process.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that this breakout occurred as the 10-day (red) moving average moved closer to an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) moved past its own ceiling at the 49.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is now tracking at 52.93, with an upcoming ceiling of 56.00 a possible hurdle for bulls.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP (formerly ripple), also saw an increase in bullish momentum, as it rebounded from a recent one-week low.
 
XRP/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $0.4673 earlier in the day, following a low of $0.4472 on Thursday.
 
Today’s peak saw the token move closer to its long-term resistance level of $0.4690, which was last broken in April.
 

 
XRP/USD – Daily ChartEarlier gains in XRP have somewhat eased, as the RSI also moved near a ceiling of its own at 55.00
 
As of writing this, the index is currently tracking at the 54.80 mark, with the price currently at $0.4673.
 
Should this ceiling at 55.00 be broken, there is a possibility that XRP will hit a one-month high in the upcoming days.

Congressman Brad Sherman's recent tweet attacking Bitcoiners as "tax evaders" is a prime example of how Bitcoin has become a mainstream phenomenon. It's ironic that politicians like Sherman, who have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and the presumption of innocence, are so quick to label Bitcoin supporters as criminals without any evidence. Such remarks undermine the fundamental principles of justice and fairness that underpin our legal system. 
The fact that politicians like Sherman are attacking Bitcoin serves as a signal to those on the fence that there may be something to this "freedom money" that is constantly under attack by th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum was once again trading above the $1,800 level, after a brief breakout during Thursday’s session. Prices rose by as much as 2%, as optimism grew that the U.S. debt ceiling could be increased. Bitcoin also marginally climbed, moving away from yesterday’s two-week low.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rose slightly higher on Friday, as prices moved away from a recent two-week low.
 
Following a low of $25,890.59 on Thursday, BTC/USD rose to a peak at $26,591.52 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw bitcoin (BTC) once again climb above a point of support at the $26,300 level, which has been in place for the past few weeks.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Despite this latest rebound, BTC remained almost 2% lower than at the same point last week.
 
For bulls, a positive sign comes in the form of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which failed to break out of a floor at 39.00
 
The last time breakout took place was back on March 10, which led to BTC falling below the $20,000 mark.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rose back above the $1,800 mark on Friday, after dropping to a multi-week low of its own yesterday.
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,817.16 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after the price fell to a bottom at $1,788.29.
 
As a result of today’s slight rebound, the 10-day (red) moving average is now firmly on the verge of crossing its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
The chances of this occurring come as price strength once again bounced from support at 44.00, leading to a reentry of long-term bulls.
 
As of writing this, the index is now tracking at 46.39, with the next visible resistance level at 51.00.
 
Should momentum continue to climb, there is a good chance that ETH could hit $1,900 this coming weekend.
