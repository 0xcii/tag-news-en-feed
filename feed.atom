        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-price-could-fall-to-50000-standard-chartered"/>
        <updated>2024-05-01T13:16:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major global bank Standard Chartered believes the Bitcoin price could see further downside to around $50,000, according to recent comments. 
Geoffrey Kendrick, head of forex and digital assets research at Standard Chartered, told The Block: "BTC's proper break below $60,000 has now reopened a route to the $50,000-52,000 range."
As of writing, Bitcoin is trading under $57,000 after a steep drawdown from recent highs above $70,000. Kendrick cited both the Bitcoin market and broader macroeconomic factors weighing on Bitcoin's price.
He highlighted five straight days of outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and the slow start for new Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs as the reasons for the recent drawdown.
Beyond markets, Kendrick pointed to deteriorating liquidity measures in the U.S. that have put pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin.
However, Standard Chartered and Kendrick maintain a bullish long-term outlook. The bank recently raised its 2024 year-end Bitcoin price target to $150,000 and sees prices potentially reaching $250,000 in 2025. 
Kendrick stated the bank's forecast remains intact, expecting the next rally to come after the 2024 U.S. elections.
Negative sentiment stemming from the recent arrests of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver could also be factors in the drawdown.

Still, the pullback also comes after Bitcoin posted seven straight months of gains, signaling a potential need for consolidation.
However, mainstream adoption continues accelerating, as seen in the massive early inflows into U.S. spot ETFs. And while Hong Kong ETF trading began slowly, these investment vehicles should unlock significant institutional demand over time.]]></summary>

Deaton, a prominent legal advocate for XRP, has issued a forceful condemnation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, accusing him of undermining ethical standards and fostering an environment of deceit at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
Deaton’s allegations emerged following a statement by Patrick McHenry, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, asserting that Gensler had misled Congress during his testimonies, particularly concerning the regulatory status of Ether as a security. McHenry’s statement reflects a broader concern about potential misrepresentations and obfuscations by the SEC which, according to him, indicate a pattern of “regulation by enforcement.”

Championed by Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, the proposed ETF is aiming to gain the coveted approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
 
Lee, brimming with optimism, recently spoke about the prospects of a Litecoin ETF. His confidence stems from the structural similarities between Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin (BTC).
 
Both currencies utilize the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, a factor that Lee believes positions Litecoin favorably for an ETF classification. Additionally, Lee argues that the altcoin’s status as a commodity strengthens its case for ETF eligibility.

Binance Founder: Guilty But Not Laundering?
 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) did not directly accuse Zhao of money laundering itself. Instead, the charges focused on his company’s inadequate AML programs, which allegedly allowed criminals to funnel illicit funds through the exchange.
 
This distinction proved crucial in the sentencing, with some legal analysts suggesting federal guidelines for nonviolent first-time offenders limited the judge’s options.

Altrichter points out that despite the scaling back of rate cut expectations—from six expected cuts at the start of the year to just one by year’s end—the markets have shown resilience. This is largely because investors still anticipate the next Federal Reserve move to be a cut, not an increase. For the crypto market, this has meant a precarious …]]></summary>
