assisting them in launching cryptocurrency services. These discussions are  
poised to bear fruit in the first quarter of the coming year.

To the end, Robin Linus, the leader of ZeroSync, which is behind the development of a zk-proof light client for Bitcoin, unveiled the “BitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin” white paper yesterday. This paper presents a groundbreaking methodology that could potentially redefine the perception of Bitcoin’s capabilities.

A Wave of Phishing Scam in Hong Kong
According to Hong Kong police, Binance customers received a text message to verify their account before the deadline with a phishing link in it.
“Recently, fraudsters posing as Binance sent text messages claiming that users must click the link in the message to verify their identity details before a deadline, otherwise their account would be deactivated,” the warning of Hong Kong police from its Facebook page dubbed “CyberDefender” stated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, many viewed it as a solution to the drawbacks of fiat money. Historically, about 800 fiat currencies have come and gone, with many ultimately failing. Intriguingly, the fundamental reasons for establishing the fiat system remain elusive to many. Some argue that it was designed by governments to perpetuate corruption and fund endless global conflicts. In a nutshell, most fiat currencies have either supported military pursuits or protected financial magnates who benefit from such endeavors.

Bitcoin Decouples with Gold
Bitcoin and gold have similar inflation-hedge narratives. Currently, gold has a lower inflation rate (1.7%) than Bitcoin (1.8%), but it will be a monumental flip at the halving. A simplistic inflation story would require gold and bitcoin to rise together. However, gold is getting hammered in the last few days while bitcoin is bouncing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The police in the Australian state of South Australia recently seized cryptocurrency worth $1.5 million from an alleged dark web drug dealer. Police also recovered a “large quantity” of the synthetic opioid nitazene as well as tens of thousands of dollars in cash.
 
‘Illicit Activity on a Dark Web Marketplace’
 
Police in South Australia, a state in the southern central part of Australia, recently seized cryptocurrency worth $1.5 million from an alleged dark web drug dealer. According to an ABC News report, law enforcement also confiscated a “large quantity” of drugs and electronic devices from an unnamed 25-year-old man.
 
Explaining how the operation against the alleged drug peddler was carried out, Adam Rice, the South Australian Detective Superintendent, said:
 
“The investigation identified illicit activity on a dark web marketplace, attributed that activity to a real-life person in South Australia, identified and traced cryptocurrency used in the offending and then ultimately led to a successful search and seizure operation.”
 
 
Among some of the drugs seized during the raid on a residential house and two storage units was a synthetic opioid known as nitazene. Authorities in the state are concerned the drug, which is highly toxic and has never been approved for human consumption, could be linked to two overdose cases in which one person died.
 
Meanwhile, the report also revealed that law enforcement officers also recovered tens of thousands in cash when they raided premises in Adelaide Hills.

Announced today by developer Robin Linus of ZeroSync, an association founded to help scale Bitcoin by using zero-knowledge proofs, BitVM is a proposal that opens very interesting doors for Bitcoin application development going forward. It can enable pretty much any arbitrary computation, and use that computation to enforce what happens to bitcoin on-chain. 
It requires no consensus changes to Bitcoin at all. The trick is lifting all of that logic off-chain and being able to challenge a few steps of the computation on-chain if the other party asserts a dishonest outcome. In short, BitVM will bring arbitrary Turing-complete computation, in an enforceable way, to bitcoin itself – today.
