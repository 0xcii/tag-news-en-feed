This strategic pivot reflects a broadened mission to leverage diverse financial technologies in promoting global financial inclusion and effectively terminates the old entity that was responsible for the management and control of the XRP Ledger (XRPL).
 
XRP Ledger Foundation Dissolves
 
The rebranding was announced through a statement on the newly launched INFTF website, where Bharath Chari, a member of the management board, outlined the rationale behind the change. “In our partnerships with various international bodies, it became increasingly evident that our foundation’s name was perceived as too narrow, aligning us solely with XRP technologies,” Chari stated.

Bitcoin Open Interest And Estimated Leverage Ratio Have Both Dropped
 
In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst talked about how the metrics related to the derivatives market have looked like recently. The indicators in question are the Open Interest and the Estimated Leverage Ratio.
 
The Open Interest (OI) measures the number of positions related to Bitcoin currently open on all derivatives exchanges. The metric includes both short and long positions.
 
 
When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up new positions on the market right now. Such a trend implies that interest in speculation among investors is rising.

JUST IN: 🇭🇰 Standard Chartered’s subsidiary bank Mox starts offering #Bitcoin ETFs on its platform. pic.twitter.com/OCzGh75FKc
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 7, 2024
  
  
  
Mox launched ETFs tracking Bitcoin on August 7th, including spot Bitcoin and crypto ETFs in Hong Kong and derivative Bitcoin ETFs in the US. The bank cited a recent survey showing about one-third of Hong Kong residents engage with Bitcoin and crypto, and a similar portion would switch banks for such services.
By leveraging its lean virtual bank infrastructure, Mox can offer lower fees on Bitcoin ETFs than traditional brokerages. The bank charges 0.12% of transaction volume on Hong Kong ETFs and 0.01% per share for US ETFs.
CEO Barbaros Uygun said adding Bitcoin and crypto ETFs "empowers our customers to gain access to emerging asset classes."
As a Standard Chartered subsidiary, Mox benefits from the resources and credibility of a major global bank. Its Bitcoin and crypto ETF launch may pressure competitors to expand such offerings as well.
The move comes after successful Bitcoin ETF debuts in the US and Hong Kong amid rising retail demand. The move helps Hong Kong investors access Bitcoin ETFs and highlights Bitcoin's mainstream adoption.]]></summary>

Trump’s promise to oust the crypto-skeptic Gary Gensler resonated with many in the crypto industry who were concerned about the SEC’s enforcement approach to regulating the crypto space. However, a closer examination of the legal and political realities suggests that Trump’s promise may be easier said than done.
 
Legal Limits And Political Realities
 
According to a Fortune report, the SEC operates as an independent federal agency, with commissioners— including the chair—shielded by protections that prevent arbitrary removal.
