The proposed change is aimed at increasing transaction throughput by approximately 33%.
 
The motivation behind the proposal is to better distribute bandwidth usage over time, thereby lowering peak bandwidth requirements. By smoothing out bandwidth needs, Ethereum could maintain greater efficiency and reduce stress on node operators, particularly those with limited bandwidth capacity. According to Adams, this adjustment is designed to enhance throughput without compromising the accessibility of the network.
