JUST IN: Mt. Gox moved 95,870 #Bitcoin worth $6 billion to unknown addresses 👀 pic.twitter.com/duCIiVPcsK
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 16, 2024
  
  
  
On-chain data shows that Mt. Gox's wallet transferred around 95,870 BTC across two transactions to newly-created addresses. The first shift of 47,000 bitcoin was valued at nearly $3 billion.
The destination wallets remain unidentified but are presumed to be linked to Mt. Gox's ongoing repayment process. The exchange owes creditors $9 billion in total, stemming from Bitcoin lost in Mt. Gox's infamous 2014 hack.
Saturday's large transactions follow initial smaller test transfers last week as Mt. Gox prepared to distribute funds. Analysts have feared the payouts could weigh on Bitcoin's price if creditors immediately liquidate holdings.
So far, the transfers have coincided with dips below $64,000 as markets reacted cautiously. But the expectation remains that most creditors will hold the restored coins rather than rush to sell.
While unnerving for traders, the long-awaited Mt. Gox reimbursement will close the book on one of the Bitcoin industry's most infamous episodes. Tens of thousands of early adopters lost holdings when the pioneering exchange collapsed.
Over eight years later, creditors will finally recoup some of those early losses. The saga underscores Bitcoin's resilience and the community's commitment to accountable custody and transparent transactions.]]></summary>

It’s an operational hazard for the industry. It’s an ongoing thing, in the same way that hacking is a thing within tech. You can’t stop it, but you can minimise its risks.
 
 
A Closer Look At The Method
 
Cybersecurity experts said North Korean hackers use social engineering to target cryptocurrency companies. Security expert Taylor Monahan explained how these ‘nefarious’ hackers trick employees into “unwittingly” allowing them access to the company’s private data.

has reportedly given "preliminary approval" to at least three asset

According to a July 15 report by Reuters, the SEC approval

the regulator before the end of this week. The report cited three industry  
sources.
Ether ETFs Launch Imminent
The asset managers mentioned in the report include  
BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck. Additionally, Fidelity, ARK

A local media outlet reported that South Korean lawmakers have proposed postponing the enforcement of crypto taxation in the country again. Originally, the government proposed implementing a 20% tax on crypto gains by January 2022.
 
The new rule has been postponed twice, with the latest delay setting the implementation date to January 2025. If passed, the new bill, proposed by the South Korean ruling party, would push the crypto tax date to 2028, a six-year delay from the original date.
