        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Holdings has turned a profit of $296 million in 2023, recovering from a loss of $1 billion in the previous year, as the upward movement of cryptocurrency prices has picked up.
Q4 Was the Profit Generator
Interestingly, the final quarter of 2023 turned the results for the company when it generated a net income of $302 million, compared to a loss of $288 million in the corresponding quarter of the precious year. Even in the third quarter of 2023, it had a loss of $94 million.
“Since the end of the fourth quarter 2023, digital asset prices materially changed, and our business has benefited from heightened market volatility and increased trading volumes,” the company stated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the bullish momentum witnessed in the cryptocurrency market, fueled by a significant uptick in Bitcoin’s price, skepticism among short sellers persists, and billions of dollars have been wagered on the downturn of cryptocurrency-linked stocks.
 
For context, Short sellers are investors who speculate that a stock’s or other asset’s price will decline. They borrow shares of the asset from a broker and sell them on the open market at the current price.
 
They aim to buy back the same number of shares later at a lower price, return the borrowed shares to the broker, and pocket the difference as profit.

Investors Push For Higher Valuation
 
According to a Bloomberg report, the investors holding tokens called Serum, MAPS, and OXY are urging US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey to override the company’s experts’ conclusion that the tokens are “nearly worthless.” 
 
Notably, Sam Bankman-Fried, who created Serum and obtained control over the other two tokens, was involved in securing deals related to them, as mentioned in court documents.

Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, has shared a rather cautious outlook, estimating the likelihood of an ETH spot ETF receiving the green light at a mere 25%.
 
 
Ethereum Slight Chance To A Spot ETF Approval
 
Skepticism about the unlikelihood of a spot ETH ETF approval is rooted in what Balchunas perceives as deliberate non-engagement from the SEC rather than mere procrastination, leading to an absence of positive indicators for approval in the current environment.
