Crypto Mining Scheme: Bypassing Banking Rules
 
The interesting part of this story is that the mining site is said to have been used to send money from China to the US in a sneaky way. According to the report in the New York Times, Yu used the facility to send money to other people without drawing notice from the government.

In fact, those excited that a Bitcoin spot ETF approval could take place as soon as January may be shocked to know the initial attempt at a Bitcoin ETF dates back to July 2013 .
That's when investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, then best known for their controversial role in creating Facebook, first proposed the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded vehicle that would open up Bitcoin to institutional investors. 
However, despite their forward-thinking proposal, the SEC officially rejected the proposal in March 2017, citing concerns about market surveillance and regulation. At the time, the Bitcoin price dropped some 30 percent on the news, declining from a high of around $1…]]></summary>

researchers revealed that cryptocurrency users lost nearly $2 billion to scams,  
rug pulls, and hacks in 2023. Although this represented a significant reduction  
from the previous year, it underscores the ongoing vulnerability of the  
industry to security risks.
Market Decline and Improved Awareness Contribute to Lowered  
Crypto Risks
The decrease in losses is largely attributed to the  
implementation of enhanced security protocols, increased awareness within the  
community, and an overall decline in market activity. Notably, this reduction  
becomes even more substantial when factoring in the $40 billion lost to the  
collapses of the stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs, the crypto lender Celsius, and the
