(SBF) faced some tough questions from New York prosecutors today (Monday). The

his past statements and admissions, including derogatory remarks about certain

Crypto Exodus: Over $2 Billion in Bitcoins Pulled from Exchanges in 90 Days
 

 
The count of bitcoins on centralized exchanges has plummeted to a multi-year low, with a mere 36,000 BTC exceeding the 2 million mark. This starkly contrasts the 2.513 million BTC stashed on trading platforms as of November 5, 2022.
 

 
Within a span of under a year, exchanges saw a reduction of 477,000 BTC. Fast forward to July 31, 2023, and about 2.096 million bitcoins were held on these trading platforms. T…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The term "crypto" has become a buzzword, encompassing a wide range of digital assets. Amongst Bitcoiners, it has also become a derogatory term used to refer to altcoins, as seen in the oft-repeated phrase “Bitcoin, Not Crypto.” However, not everything in the crypto world is truly "crypto," at least not in the literal sense of the name.
The true essence of a cryptocurrency lies in its reliance on cryptography, and nothing else, to secure its network. This brings us to an essential distinction: only proof-of-work coins can be genuinely considered “crypto.” This distinction is not just semantic but fundamentally important, as it underscores what exactly strengthens the ledger.

In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, prominent finance lawyer Scott Johnsson mentioned how the asset manager’s revised prospectus shared a similar language to BlackRock’s as it relates to seeding.

This ominous date, etched indelibly in financial history, is synonymous with a “black swan” event, characterized by its profoundly adverse nature and the near-impossibility of prediction. The following narrative embarks on a retrospective journey through the events of that memorable day in 2020.
