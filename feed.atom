Stablecoin Tether on Brink of Record Market Capitalization
 
Approximately 370 days ago, specifically on May 8, 2022, tether’s (USDT) market capitalization soared to an all-time high (ATH) of $83.279 billion. It was during this period that Terra’s once-stable coin, terrausd (UST), became unpegged from its $1 parity.

        <updated>2023-05-13T14:06:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana rose by as much as 5% in today’s session, as cryptocurrencies began to recover from Friday’s red wave. The global market cap was up by nearly 2% at the time of writing. Chainlink also rose, moving back above a key resistance level.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) moved back above the $20.00 mark to start the weekend, as the token rose by as much as 5% today.
 
Following a low of $19.81 on Friday, SOL/USD jumped to an intraday peak at $21.25 on Saturday.
 
The rebound came as solana collided with an interim floor at $19.90, which has acted as the last line of defense following breakout below $20.00.
 
 
Looking at the chart, there was a similar rebound at the same point on April 10, which then led SOL to going on a six-day win streak.
 
Saturday’s rally also came as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped beyond a ceiling at the 45.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 46.49, with the next visible point of resistance at 50.00.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) also moved higher in today’s session, with price breaking out of a key price point.
 
LINK/USD raced to a high of $6.63 to start the weekend, hours after falling to a low of $6.37.
 
Today’s jump in price has seen chainlink move above a long-term ceiling of $6.50, after trading above this mark for the last two-months.
 
 
From the chart, the rise has seen price strength rise to a ceiling of its own at 42.00, however it has so far failed to move beyond this level.
 
Price strength is now at a reading of 41.20, with a support point at 40.00, in the event momentum begins to shift.
 
A slight shift has already occurred, with LINK now trading at $6.58, which is marginally below earlier highs.

The race for the 2024 U.S. presidential election is starting to kick into gear, featuring some of the same cast of characters from the last few elections. On the Democratic side, you have Joe Biden, Robert F. Kennedy and Marianne Williamson suggesting they will run. Then, Former President Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy are on the other side of the aisle.
If you have been following the race so far, you might know that Trump seems to be walking away with the nomination before the process even starts next year. If he ends up being the nominee, we will likely get a re-run of 2020, where we have two men over 70 years old who both think that they know what is right for the countr…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-05-13T12:07:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin bounced back from a near two-month low on Saturday, as bulls moved in to buy the recent dip in price. Saturday’s move came as the cryptocurrency rebounded from a recent support point, after yesterday’s breakout. Ethereum was also higher, climbing above $1,800.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved away from a recent two-month low on Saturday, as bulls opted to buy the recent dip.
 
After falling to a low of $25,878.43 on Friday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $26,989.07 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s rebound sees bitcoin jump back above a key support point at $26,500, following Friday’s breakout.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that this took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) found a floor of its own at 36.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 37.99, with a ceiling at 43.00 a possible target.
 
Should bulls lead the charge to this point, it is likely that bitcoin will be back above the $27,000 level this weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was back above a key price level to start the weekend, as it once again rose above the $1,800 mark.
 
ETH/USD hit a peak of $1,816.06 in today’s session, less than 24 hours after declining to a low at $1,747.94.
 
Bulls have seemingly taken yesterday’s move to a multi-week low as an opportune moment to increase position sizes in ETH.
 
 
Like with BTC, this was helped by the fact that RSI found a stable point of support, which in the case of ethereum was at the 41.00 zone.
 
From the floor, price strength is now tracking close to a ceiling at 45.00, and should this be broken, ETH will possibly move back above a key point at $1,830.

IMF Warns About U.S. Debt Default
 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations would have “very serious repercussions” on both the American and global economies.
 
IMF Director of Communications Julie Kozack was asked at a press briefing on Thursday about “the knock-on effects” on the global economy, particularly for emerging markets, of “the debt ceiling crisis that is happe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Friday Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis signed legislation that bans the use of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the state. Following the bill SB 7054 being signed into law, Florida’s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) now explicitly forbids the use of a federally adopted CBDC as money.
 
Florida Puts the Brakes on CBDCs
 
The Sunshine State has officially outlawed the use of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) following the approval of SB 7054 or HB 7049 by the Florida House of Representatives and Senate. Governor Ron DeSantis put pen to paper and signed the bill, cementing the ban on Friday. The signing ceremony, which took place in Fort Myers, was attended by Wilton Simpson, the state’s 13th commissioner of agriculture, and Kathleen Passidomo, president of the Southwest Florida…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of United States senators have introduced a bill requiring reports on the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador. 
The "Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador Act," introduced by Senator James Risch, Senator Bob Menendez, and Senator Bill Cassidy, requires the Secretary of State, in coordination with other relevant Federal departments and agencies, to submit a report on the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador. The report must include an assessment of the regulatory framework in El Salvador and the potential impact of Bitcoin adoption on macroeconomic stability, democratic governance, and the flow of remittances from the United States to El Salvador.
The bill also calls for a plan to mitigate any potential risks to the United States financial system posed by the adoption of a cryptocurrency as legal tender in El Salvador and any other country that uses the U.S. dollar as legal tender. According to the bill, the plan should be submitted to the appropriate committees of Congress no later than 90 days after the report required by subsection (a).
The Bitcoin Law, passed by the Salvadoran government in June 2021, gives Bitcoin legal tender status in the country. The move was criticized by some experts, who argued that it could lead to instability in the country's economy. Others, however, saw the move as a potential catalyst for broader adoption of bitcoin in the region. Despite the controversy surrounding the move, El Salvador has remained committed to its Bitcoin adoption plans.]]></summary>
