Elon Musk on Fed Rate Hikes
 
Tesla, Spacex, and Twitter boss Elon Musk warned Thursday about the damaging impact of the Federal Reserve rapidly raising interest rates.
 
His warning was in reply to a tweet by former investment manager Genevieve Roch-Decter stating that “the Fed has never raised rates faster” than this year. Musk wrote:

This is an opinion editorial by Frankie Wallace, a freelance writer from the Pacific Northwest.
Medical tourism is on the rise. Every year millions of Americans save between 40-80% in medical fees by crossing the border or taking a short plane ride to receive the care they need. Even after the pandemic slowed international travel, more people looked abroad for shorter wait times, better service, and lower fees. 
Bitcoin can boost the medical tourism sector and help patients get the treatment they need at a price that is affordable. Bitcoin can make transactions abroad easier and ensure that everyone gets a fair deal.

In her statements, Ellison describes that she was the co-CEO and CEO of Alameda, and under those roles, she reported directly to the former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). The ex-Alameda CEO’s testimony details that she was fully aware from 2019 to 2022, that Alameda Research had access to a special borrowing facility that allowed the company to maintain an unlimited line of credit with zero collateral. The ‘borrowing facility,’ according to Ellison, was FTX’s customer funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano climbed for a second consecutive session on Dec. 23, as the token surged to its highest point since Monday. Overall, crypto prices were marginally higher as of writing, with the global market cap currently up 0.49%. Xrp, formerly known as ripple, also rose, with prices nearing a key resistance level.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was in the green on Friday, as prices surged for a second straight session.
 
ADA/USD raced to a high of $0.2623 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after the token was trading at $0.2482.
 
The move saw the token climb towards a resistance level of $0.2685, and it is currently trading at its highest point since Monday.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, Friday’s gains come as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has moved closer to a ceiling of its own at 32.00.
 
The index is currently tracking at 30.18, with the price slipping from earlier highs, and trading at $0.2586 as of writing.
 
In order for bulls to hit the ceiling at the $0.2685 mark, this upcoming ceiling of 32.00 on the RSI must first be broken.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, also rose on Friday, as the token extended a recent bull run, in hopes of breaking out of a key resistance point.
 
Following a low of $0.3424, XRP/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.3531 earlier in today’s session.
 
Today’s high is the strongest point that the token has traded at since Sunday, when it was at a top of $0.3555.
 
 
Despite this recent climb in price, sentiment in XRP still appears to be bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) extending its downwards cross with the 25-day (blue) MA.
 
In addition to this, the 14-day RSI is currently tracking at 39.65, which is close to a ceiling of 41.00.
 
If bulls are unable to force a breakout of this level, we will likely see XRP once again move lower.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance has been under intense scrutiny since it released its proof of reserves about a month ago. The crypto exchange had done so in a bid to assure users that all deposited funds were safe and that it was not going to collapse like FTX, but this had backfired spectacularly for the company. As the FUD ramped up, more than $6 billion was withdrawn from the exchange in a matter of days. Now, Binance has come forward to address the most pressing questions from the community.
 
Binance Says Assets Are Fully Backed
 
In a blog post published on its website on Friday, Binance addressed the most prominent questions from community members over the last two weeks, and that is whether the exchange had enough funds to back all user deposits.
