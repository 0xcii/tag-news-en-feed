Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to proceed with its lawsuit against  
Coinbase. While dismissing one of the regulator's claims, the  
decision paves the way for a potentially lengthy legal battle. This action  
marks a significant development in the ongoing regulatory scrutiny facing digital assets firms, Reuters reported.
US District Judge Katherine Failla partly

company of violating securities regulations. Despite this partial win, the ruling largely aligns  
with the SEC's approach to cryptocurrency regulation, echoing previous

His statement immediately impacted SHIB’s price, with the crypto token recording some gains in the last 24 hours. 
 
Shiba Inu Performs Beyond Expectations
 
Vitalik mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “SHIB massively outperformed” his expectations. He made this statement while revealing that he had donated SHIB to the Future of Life Institute (FLI). The Ethereum co-founder suggested that he had made this donation long beforehand in fear that the transaction would take a while before being processed.

The charges, related to conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, have stirred concerns among users and investors about the future of the Seychelles-based exchange, echoing fears reminiscent of the FTX collapse.
 
Is KuCoin The Next FTX?
 
According to the official press release by the Southern District of New York, the indictment accuses KuCoin and its founders of deliberately failing to implement an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program.

We are on the brink of a dramatic change where we are about to, and I'll say this boldly, abandon the traditional system of money and accounting and introduce a new one. And the new one is what we call blockchain.
It means digital. It means having an almost perfect record of every single transaction that happens in the economy, which will give us far greater clarity over what's going on. It also raises huge dangers in terms of the balance of power between states and citizens. In my opinion, we're going to need a digital constitution of human rights if we're going to have digital money.

News of Lummis’s participation in The Bitcoin Policy Summit by The Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) comes after comments made by the Senator in support of bitcoin mining earlier this year: "Bitcoin mining is good for America’s energy grids and the development of new/stranded energy resources… Bitcoin miners, we’d love to have you in Wyoming.”
