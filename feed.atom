Kurt S. Altrichter, a notable financial advisor, has provided an in-depth analysis of possible outcomes and their ramifications on X, offering a roadmap of expectations for market participants.

This is largely because investors still anticipate the next Federal Reserve move to be a cut, not an increase. For the crypto market, this has meant a precarious …]]></summary>

The second largest cryptocurrency has also been in the spotlight after a key component in its ecosystem, Consensys, sued the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for “unlawful seizure of authority” over the asset.
 
The lawsuit sparked different conversations, including the SEC’s regulatory inconsistencies and speculation about the relationship between the US agency and people close to Ethereum.
 
 
Does Consensys Need Prayers?
 
On April 25, blockchain software company Consensys filed a lawsuit against the US SEC. The lawsuit seeks a court ruling that declares ETH is not a security.
