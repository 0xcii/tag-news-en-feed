Shiba Inu Balance On Exchange Has Been Falling Since November
 
As pointed out by analyst Ali in a new post on X, a large amount of Shiba Inu has left exchanges since November. The relevant metric here is the “Balance on Exchanges,” which keeps track of the total amount of SHIB that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that the investors are depositing a net number of coins to these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons why investors would make such transfers is for selling purposes, this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the asset’s price.

Indeed, Santa granted bitcoin enthusiasts a 15.93% boost this December, yet it’s unlikely to be remembered as an official ‘Bitcoin Santa Claus rally‘ akin to the ones seen in 2017 and 2011. From Dec. 1, 2023, to the eve of Christmas, BTC soared from $37,721 per unit to an impressive peak of $43,730. Nonetheless, it secured the seventh spot in the record books, marginally outpacing the 5.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Japanese government has approved a tax reform that removes some crypto taxes for corporations and conglomerates. The reform, discussed since early December, removes the unrealized gains taxes on crypto holdings for companies, paving the way for them to hold crypto assets more consistently.
Japanese Government Approves Tax Reform to Eliminate Unrealized Gains Tax
The Japanese cabinet convened to approve the FY2018 tax reform, which includes a series of modifications to rules affecting companies in the cryptocurrency area. The reform included a change that removed the “unrealized gains” crypto tax that mandated companies to pay tribute based on the price change of crypto assets each fiscal year.
A change that eliminated this tax for companies’ self-issued cryptocurrencies had already been approved earlier this year, but with this modification, crypto companies can now hold crypto issued by third parties without paying the unrealized gains taxes.
However, cryptocurrency sales and purchases will continue to be taxed. This opposes the petition of the Japan Crypto Asset Business Association, which asked for eliminating the tax on crypto exchanges. According to local media, the measure will contribute to a general reduction in tax-derived income for June 2024, expected to be the largest since 1989.
The reform, which had been in discussion since early December, is directed to make it easier for corporations to add crypto to their treasury without paying for simply holding it. Japan is one of the few countries that applies this unrealized crypto gains tax, prompting companies to hold these assets in other countries.
Nonetheless, even after this approval, the tax reform will have to be presented to the Diet next year and will have to be passed by both houses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes, former CEO of Bitmex and cryptocurrency market analyst, pondered about the success of an upcoming spot bitcoin ETF and its effect on the future of bitcoin. Hayes states that the popularity of these ETF derivatives might concentrate the custody of all the bitcoin in a few hands that won’t move it, forcing miners to capitulate due to a lack of activity in the blockchain.
Arthur Hayes Believes ETFs Might Cause the Demise of Bitcoin
Former Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes believes that the success of an upcoming spot bitcoin ETF might endanger the existence of the Bitcoin network. In his most recent blog post, “Expression,” Hayes presents a hypothetical situation in which bitcoin is all in the hands of a few financial firms, like Blackrock.
If this happens, Hayes anticipates this will destroy bitcoin as a store of value, given that it is different from all of the assets traded in financial markets until now.
Hayes argued:
Bitcoin is the first monetary asset in human history that exists only if it moves. But if there was never another Bitcoin transaction between two entities, miners would be unable to afford the energy it costs to secure the network.
The result of this would be the shutdown of the whole Bitcoin network due to the starvation of miners who will receive fees only from bitcoin transactions after the subsidy ends circa 2140.
Hayes adds that this could happen if users come to value bitcoin as a financial asset more than a store of value, favoring the purchase of derivatives instead of the cryptocurrency. However, if bitcoin suffers this fate, Hayes anticipates the birth of a similar asset to allow people to transact in a non-state-owned financial system.
“Hopefully, the second time around, we will learn not to hand our private keys to the baldies,” he concluded.
