Shibarium introduced new and practical use cases for SHIB and BONE, two of the most popular tokens of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, in a strategic effort to transcend its meme coin status and establish a more serious, utility-driven presence in the crypto space. 
 
Since then, Shibarium has registered various milestones. The value of SHIB has also become intertwined with the performance and activity on the Shibarium layer-2 network.

Recent disclosures reveal that Trump possesses between $1 million and $5 million in Ethereum alone. A change in his financial portfolio reflects a general transformation in his attitude toward the crypto world, which he used to describe up to now as a “scam.”
 
 
Trump: Change Of Heart
 
While being the president, Trump was never in reserve about his aversion to cryptocurrencies. He even warned that they would make it easier for illegal activities to be done and that they are not real money.
