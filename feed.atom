Armstrong argues that without such laws, firms may be forced to develop in “offshore havens,” where they may be subject to less oversight and regulation.
 
According to a Reuters report, Armstrong made the comments during a conference held by the Innovate Finance industry body, citing the failure of the Bahamas-based FTX exchange last year as evidence of the need for clearer regulations.

Additionally, a lawsuit initiated by New York attorney general Letitia James against Kucoin insists that ethereum is also an unregistered security.
