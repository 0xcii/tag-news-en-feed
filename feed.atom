        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Philippines' securities regulator has taken  
enforcement action against Binance, ordering Google and Apple to remove its apps from their respective app stores. This action follows allegations that

One of Bitcoin's undeniable and frequently touted strengths is its decentralization. It's often claimed that the Bitcoin network offers levels of decentralization, accessibility, and distribution unmatched by any other cryptocurrency. But just how decentralized is Bitcoin in reality? And how do we go about measuring its decentralization? Before delving into these questions, it's crucial to clarify the concepts of centralization and decentralization, as they are often muddled.
To provide a clear definition, the centralization/decentralization dynamic can be understood as the degree of concentration/diffusion of authority among the participants in a system. Here, "authority" refers to the power to influence the functioning and rules of the system, whether for malicious or benign…]]></summary>
