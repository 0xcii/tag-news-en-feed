According to a press statement, Kucoin Ventures’ support is set to be allocated to five “TON-based mini-apps” focused on payments or Gamefi that push the boundaries of what’s possible in Web3.
 
Projects based on the TON ecosystem, such as the Future3 Campus and the TON Bootcamp, are in line to receive a portion of the grant. The grant is also expected to bolster marketing initiatives aimed at raising awareness about the TON blockchain.
 

 
Commenting on his organization’s partnership with Kucoin Ventures, the Accelerator Head at TON Foundation, Ian W, said:
 
“Today’s partnership with Kucoin Ventures is an acceleration point in the momentum of mini-app development on The Open Network. With powerful programs like the Future3 Campus Bootcamp and this support from Kucoin Ventures, we’re fueling real-world blockchain solutions in payments and gaming within the TON ecosystem.”
