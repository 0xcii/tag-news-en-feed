        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Sunday evening, US President Joseph Biden announced his not-so-surprising exit from the 2024 Presidential race, saying it was in “the best interest of [his] party and the country.” He also endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris's bid to run against the popular former US President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate.
Although Harris is a known political face—she ran with Biden for the Vice President post in 2020 and won—it is still being determined how the markets will react in the coming weeks. Notably, it is not confirmed whether Harris would represent Democrats in the race against Republican Trump. However, Biden’s endorsement has made her the top candidate for the race.

This change occurred just days before the Bitcoin 2024 conference scheduled in Nashville from July 25-27, where prominent figures, including US presidential candidate Donald Trump, are slated to speak.
 
The anticipation around the conference intensified after rumors surfaced last week, suggesting that Trump might endorse BTC as a potential reserve asset should he be elected in the upcoming November presidential elections. Dennis Porter, founder of the regulatory advocacy group Satoshi Act Fund, stirred the pot further by posting on X about an unverified leak…]]></summary>
