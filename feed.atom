        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a period of volatility as investors grapple with conflicting forces. Renewed anxieties about stagflation in the US – a scenario of high inflation coupled with sluggish economic growth – are putting downward pressure on prices.
 
However, potential countervailing factors, including a liquidity injection from the US government and the launch of Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs, are offering a glimmer of hope.
 
 
Crypto Prices Tumble On Stagflation Jitters
 
Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, is currently trading around $62,559, representing a 1.5% decline in the past 24 hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), which accounts for the majority of trading volume in Australia, is expected to approve the country's first spot bitcoin ETFs on ASX before the end of 2024, according to a recent Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter.

BREAKING: 🇦🇺 Australia to approve the spot #Bitcoin ETFs before the end of 2024: Bloomberg pic.twitter.com/pK7XadHhto
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 29, 2024
 
 
 
Two entities, Cosmos Asset Management and 3iQ, have already applied for spot bitcoin ETFs with the ASX, while VanEck Australia is working towards submitting its application, as per Bloomberg. 
Earlier this month, Australia-based asset manager Monochrome also applied for a spot bitcoin ETF with rival exchange Cboe Australia.
The potential launch follows major spot bitcoin ETF approvals in the US and Hong Kong. In January, the SEC approved several US spot bitcoin ETFs, which attracted over $200 billion in volume within just three months. 
Meanwhile, Hong Kong's first spot bitcoin ETF is set to begin trading tomorrow after receiving regulatory approval last week.
The success of spot bitcoin ETFs in these major financial hubs has prompted Australia to follow suit. With the ASX expected to approve spot bitcoin ETFs by year's end, Australia is positioning itself to benefit from surging demand.

This is a major milestone for Bitcoin adoption in Australia and reflects the growing acceptance of Bitcoin's investment merits. As more countries approve spot Bitcoin ETFs in the wake of the US, it further validates Bitcoin and could compel additional uptake worldwide.]]></summary>
