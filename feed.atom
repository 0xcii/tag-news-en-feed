On August 12th, Marathon announced a $250 million convertible note offering to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. The notes were met with strong demand, allowing Marathon to upsize the deal to $300 million.
The company then used $249 million of the proceeds to accumulate 4,144 additional Bitcoin at an average price of $59,500 per Bitcoin. This boosts Marathon's Bitcoin reserves to over 25,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion.
In July, Marathon bought $100 million of Bitcoin on the open market as part of its long-term "hodl" strategy. The Nasdaq-listed miner aims to hold newly mined coins rather than sell them.
Marathon is aggressively expanding its Bitcoin stash by mimicking MicroStrategy's corporate playbook. Other firms, such as Semler Scientific and Metaplanet, are also raising money in debt markets to buy more Bitcoin and ride its adoption curve. 
These savvy public companies are using the fiat system's cheap lending rates to accumulate scarce Bitcoin. This demonstrates Bitcoin's growing conviction that it is the best strategic reserve asset for public companies.]]></summary>

Kaiko analysts noted in the report that liquidity fragmentation continues to persist for the flagship crypto, leading to price discrepancies across exchanges. Simply put, liquidity fragmentation refers to when liquidity is unevenly distributed across these exchanges, leading to unstable prices, especially among less liquid exchanges. 
 
 
Although this liquidity fragmentation has reduced for Bitcoin over time, the research firm noted that it was very apparent during last week’s sell-off, which led to the flagship crypto dropping below $50,000 fo…]]></summary>
