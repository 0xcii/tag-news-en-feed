        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-atom-sol-remain-close-to-multi-week-highs-as-markets-consolidate-recent-gains/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-15T15:38:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cosmos climbed by as much as 5% in Wednesday’s session, as the token remained close to a multi-week high. Cryptocurrency markets consolidated recent gains in today’s session, with the global market cap down by 0.24% as of writing. Solana continued to trade above $20.00, as prices consolidated. 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Cosmos (ATOM) was once again in the green, as prices remained close to a recent multi-week high.
 
Following a high of $13.47 on Tuesday, ATOM/USD hit a peak of $13.41 earlier in today’s session, before prices have since plunged.
 
Since hitting a three-week high during yesterday’s session, cosmos bulls have moved to consolidate gains, with ATOM now trading at $12.55.
 
 
Overall, bulls have seemingly moved to take profits, following a failed breakout attempt of the $13.50 ceiling.
 
Looking at the chart, the decline comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) was also unable to move past a resistance zone of its own at 57.00
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 51.52, with a floor at 50.00 a possible destination for traders.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
In addition to ATOM, solana (SOL) also remained near a recent high, despite market sentiment shifting in today’s session.
 
SOL/USD fell to a low of $20.31 earlier in today’s session, hours removed from a peak at the $22.11 mark.
 
Yesterday’s high saw solana trade at its strongest point since March 2, when the token was trading close to $23.00.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the SOL bulls began shifting away from earlier positions, following a collision with a ceiling on the RSI.
 
Price strength hit a point of resistance at the 50.00 level, which has been in place since late-February.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 48.91, with the next visible floor at the 45.00 level.

This is an opinion editorial by Julian Liniger, the co-founder and CEO of Relai, a bitcoin-only investment app.
‘On The Brink Of Second Bailout For Banks’
At its core, Bitcoin is a transaction database. Every 10 minutes, a new collection of such transactions, called a block, is queued up on Bitcoin, immutable for all eternity. Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious mastermind behind the first and most popular cryptocurrency, created that first transaction block themself. But Bitcoin is also a political project — at least, the idea behind it was and always will be political. Nakamoto inserted a message into the code that still…]]></summary>

For instance, the United States GDP fell by 8.9%, and even the country’s imports exceeded its exports as demand from firms and consumers heightened. Currently, the country is battling inflation and sluggish economic activity.
 
 
According to a report from OECD, the growth in the economy dropped by about 1.5% in 2022, and in 2023, it recorded around a 0.5% reduction. While the decline may be negligible, the ongoing economic crisis has affected the operations of specific organizations, including Meta, a popular social media company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining company Luxor Technologies has launched an Antminer-compatible firmware designed to maximize miner efficiency.
 
         
         
         
         
    
Luxor Technologies, a Bitcoin mining software and services company, has released LuxOS, the first third-party Antminer-compatible firmware fully designed and engineered in the United States.
The press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine describes firmware as “a type of software that is designed to provide specific operating instructions to computing hardware. For Bitcoin miners, firmware allows them to adjust the performance of the ASIC chips in their Bitcoin mining rigs to optimize for higher hash rate and improved power efficiency.” 
When mining profitability is low, miners can utilize firmware to improve their machine’s power efficiency to increase gross margins. When profitability is high, miners can use their firmware to increase a machine’s hash rate in an attempt to quicken their return on their investment.
Luxor CEO Nick Hansen described how, “We’ve received consistent feedback from our partners that the market lacked a US-designed-and-engineered custom firmware to help them improve their mining margins. Luxor’s team was uniquely positioned to build this product and we’re thrilled to open up our firmware to old and new partners alike,”
According to the press release, LuxOS is available now for the Bitmain Antminer S19 series and S9 series Bitcoin miners. The Luxor team custom built the firmware using Rust, and it does not rely on open-source options like CG miner. In addition to this, Bitcoin miners who use LuxOS will receive discounted fees when they use Luxor’s bitcoin mining pool.]]></summary>
