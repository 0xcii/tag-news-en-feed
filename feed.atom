This is an opinion editorial by Shinobi, a self-taught educator in the Bitcoin space and tech-oriented Bitcoin podcast host.
Channel jamming is one of the most threatening outstanding problems with the Lightning Network. It presents an open mechanism to denial-of-service attack nodes on the network to prevent them from routing, losing them money while their liquidity is locked up and unable to forward payments that will earn them fees.

This makes that liquidity useless for forwarding other payments until the hashed timelock contract (HTLC) timeloc…]]></summary>

As Bitcoinist reported last week, SBF was granted a $250 million bail. When his family posted their house as collateral, the former FTX was allowed to await trial under house arrest. The FTX founder was allegedly involved in a scheme that cost his clients over $8 billion in losses.
 
In that sense, the U.S. court’s leniency and the fact that SBF’s parents supposedly failed to meet the criteria to make bail raised several concerns regarding the legal process. Across social media, users expressed their concerns and distrust about the c…]]></summary>
