Elliot Wave Theory Predicts Over 5,000% Increase
 
Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto is not new to making predictions about the XRP price. The analyst’s previous predictions have put the altcoin at $1.5, $2, and so on in the past. So the latest price prediction from the pseudonymous crypto analyst is not really out of character.
 
 
However, this time around, using the Elliot Wave Theory, Egrag has made a mouthwatering prediction for the XRP price. Taking to X (formerly Twitter) Egrag revealed the reasoning behind the prediction. The first thing was pointing out tha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance has announced that it will no longer accept new users in the U.K. in order to comply with new crypto regulations from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Binance explained that it is currently looking for an FCA-authorized firm to review and approve its U.K. financial promotions in compliance with the new rules.
 
Binance Halts Accepting Users in the U.K.
 
Cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced an update for its U.K. operation on Monday. The announcement states:
 

From Monday 16 October 2023 at 5pm UK time, Binance will stop accepting new UK users.
 
Binance explained that the U.K. financial promotions regime for qualifying crypto assets went into effect on Oct. 8, noting that the new rules allow unregulated overseas platforms, like Binance, to promote their crypto businesses in the U.K. by engaging with FCA-authorized firms.
 
“We engaged FCA authorized firm, Rebuildingsociety.com Ltd (REBS), to review and approve our U.K. financial promotions in compliance with the new rules,” Binance stated. However, the exchange added that on Oct. 10, the FCA imposed “legally-binding requirements” on REBS, making it no longer able to approve financial promotions. In addition, with effect from Oct. 11 at 5 p.m., “REBS had to withdraw any existing approvals of financial promotions on behalf of any cryptoasset businesses (including Binance),” the crypto exchange detailed.
 
 
Binance emphasized:
 

Binance is currently looking for a new FCA authorized approver.
 
The cryptocurrency company clarified that temporary restrictions will be imposed on its U.K. platform and the latest version of its mobile app. These restrictions will be in place until Binance successfully onboards with a new FCA-authorized approver and receives reapproval for its financial promotions.

Stakers were being rewarded handsomely for committing their ETH tokens to help secure the network, prompting a rapid rise in the percentage of ETH supply staked. However, there has been a sharp decline in the APY which has raised the question of whether it is still worth it to stake ETH.
 
Ethereum Staking APY Falls To 3.5%
 
In an interesting turn of events, the yearly APY that is being paid to Ethereum stakers has dropped to 3.5%. This was the case on the last reward day which took place on Sunday, October 15, and as the BeaconChain website points out, stakers are now receiving 3.502% rewards per annum.

A recent report by the onchain analytics firm Glassnode examines how bitcoin (BTC) changes hands between investors over time. The study tracks the ebb and flow of coins moving from long-term holders who accumulated bitcoin during the bear market, to short-term speculators trying to profit on price swings.
 

 
Glassnode utilizes a metric called “realized capital” to measure the total amount paid historically to acquire all existing bitcoins. This offers a view into when coins last moved between investors. Glassn…]]></summary>

This move effectively transitions Binance.US into a crypto-only exchange, restricting the deposit and withdrawal of fiat currency. In early June, Binance.US suspended dollar deposits following the SEC’s request to freeze its assets.
