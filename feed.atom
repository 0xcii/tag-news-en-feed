50 Cent revealed in an Instagram post that his X account was hacked while denying any ties to the GUNIT meme coin, which was promoted on his X account. He added that the hacker made $300 million from this elaborate scam. However, that looks unlikely, considering the meme coin’s liquidity and market cap before it was quickly discovered as a scam.

Dogwifhat Crashes 26%
 
The price of Dogwifhat is currently trading at $1.8 as the doggy-themed meme coin continues to experience massive bearish pressure from prevailing market volatility. The value of the cryptocurrency has crashed massively, falling by a whopping 25.72% over the past seven days. 
 
The reason for this unexpected decline has been attributed to the recent selling pressures from WIF investors.
