        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little under a year ago, I announced on Twitter the idea of the Bitcoin Script Project. To say it was well received would be an understatement. Bitcoiners were craving something they could hang onto in the middle of the bear. Glimmers of hope were on the horizon and I intended to magnify those and hopefully rally the industry around a new technological narrative. Unfortunately, life had other plans and, to make a long story short, I quickly realized I bit off more than I could chew at the time. 
The Bitcoin Script Project never saw the light of the day. At best, it was a short-lived social awareness campaign. It seeded some ideas and moved the conversation forward. At the very least, it’s probably why I have the privilege of working on this column today. I bring this up because my experi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto.com has reached a new milestone by surpassing 100 million global users, marking a significant achievement for the company since its inception in 2016. The cryptocurrency exchange attributes this achievement to its latest marketing campaign, which included partnerships with  
renowned personalities, venues, and events.
Partnerships Propel Crypto.com
Some of the marketing efforts include hosting NBA and  
NHL Playoffs at the Crypto.com Arena and the Formula 1 Crypto.com Miami Grand  
Prix. Additionally, the firm recently released the brand film  
"INEVITABLE," under the campaign "Fortune Favors the  
Brave." 
Kris Marszlek, the CEO of Crypto.com, mentioned:  
"Positioning our brand through engaging campaigns and iconic partnerships  
has made Crypto.com a household name. But I'm most proud of the fact that we've  
surpassed the 100 million user milestone while building the most widely  
regulated platform in the industry by leading in global licenses and  
registrations."
In May, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority  
(VARA) licensed Crypto.com for full operation in institutional crypto trading.  
The exchange regional arm, CRO DAX Middle East FZE, was granted a Virtual Asset  
Service Provider license in 2023. 
Crypto.com Exchange, designed for both institutional  
and qualified retail investors, offers a suite of services, including spot  
trading, staking brokerage, and over-the-counter offerings. With plans to roll  
out the Crypto.com app and other products for retail investors in the region,  
Crypto.com aims to strengthen its position in the global cryptocurrency market.
Global Expansion Initiatives
Beyond Dubai, Crypto.com is expanding its presence  
globally. This includes the recent announcement of a specialized trading  
platform for Korean users.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

A Family Name Tarnished
 
Cartier, a direct descendant of Louis Cartier, founder of the iconic luxury brand, appears to have strayed far from the family’s reputable business. Prosecutors allege he conspired with a Colombian drug cartel, attempting to launder hundreds of millions of dollars in drug proceeds. Their scheme reportedly involved converting the illicit funds into Tether (USDT), a controversial cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar.
