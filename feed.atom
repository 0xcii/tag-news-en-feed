        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of the Hinman documents in the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) caused a massive stir in the XRP and crypto community yesterday. The emails revealed that Bill Hinman, the former head of the Division of Corporation Finance Regulation, ignored the directive of other high-ranking SEC members and virtually single-handedly classified Ether (ETH) as a non-security.
 
While this and his phone call with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin ahead of the infamous speech are certainly among the biggest revelations from the documents, the extensive collection of documents offers other insights as well, including how much Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and executive chairman Chris Larsen made from selling XRP.

Most eagerly awaited were the Hinman documents in the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC yesterday. Not only the XRP community, but the entire industry was watching tensely for the revelations, hoping that the regulator’s flimsy view would be exposed.
 
As Roslyn Layton explains, the Hinman emails expose the SEC and show an agency that cares more about its own turf than protecting investors. “They also show a high-ranking official ignoring explicit internal warnings that he was not following the law,” Layton says.
