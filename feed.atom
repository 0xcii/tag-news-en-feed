proposing an income tax on crypto gains from offshore exchanges, awaiting

This surge was influenced by the dovish remarks made on Tuesday by Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller. Observers of the market infer that Waller’s comments indicate a potential shift in the stance of the U.S. central bank, a notable deviation given his usually hawkish perspective. Concurrently, the Federal Reserve’s latest ‘Beige Book’ report presented a more troubling outlook than its predecessor, pointing to decelerated economic expansion and a rise in consumer credit defaults.

In a shocking development to the international Bitcoin community, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao is stepping down from his role as part of a guilty plea on criminal and civil charges in the US. 
Binance, the largest digital asset exchange in the world by volume, has seen its very future come into question as the result of a legal battle with the US Department of Justice (DoJ).

In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Dogecoin creator, Billy Marcus aka Shibetoshi Nakamoto openly criticized Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), expressing a general dislike for the organization and the idea behind it. 
 
“DAOs are almost universally stupid and doomed because ‘crypto communities’ are often exclusively interested in short-term profits, the hype is worth more than actual deliveries, and nobody has any incentive to build anything,” Marcus stated.

This decision follows the accidental payment of this fee by a Bitcoin user, setting a new record for a single transaction fee in US dollar terms.
 
A Bitcoin Anomaly And AntPool’s Response
 
The incident unfolded last week when a Bitcoin transaction included a fee of 83.65 BTC, equivalent to roughly $3.1 million, to transfer 55.77 BTC worth around $2.1 million. This extraordinary fee, amounting to over 120,528 times the usual rate, was initially frozen by AntPool’s risk control system.
 
 
The transaction, which drastically reduced the sender’s balance before the transaction of 139.42 BTC worth $5.2 million, was processed in block 818,087 mined by AntPool. U…]]></summary>

As Adeyemo presents a set of common-sense

Bitcoin had nearly two years of low transaction fees from the lack of demand to actually send Bitcoin transactions.

As part of the predetermined supply schedule, the block rewards are expected to be halved around April 2024 which would further drastically cut the miner revenue. To support the miners, Bitcoin needed something new to spur growth, and that was Ordinals. Ordinals drove huge demand to send Bitcoin transactions.
