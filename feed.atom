His statement provides some clarification to the XRP community, as Ripple’s alleged sales have long been pinpointed as the reason for XRP’s relatively stagnant price movement. 
 
Ripple Isn’t Dumping XRP Tokens On The Market
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Schwartz clarified that the figures showing that Ripple’s monthly XRP sales increased about three times in December are inaccurate. He alluded to the next XRP Markets Report, which will help dispel these rumors, as he stated that it will include Ripple’s aggregate holdings of XRP over the quarter.

During a recent Reddit ask-me-anything session, Buterin discussed possibly increasing Ethereum’s block gas limit by a substantial 33%. This suggestion, aimed at elevating the limit from 30 million to 40 million gas units, marks a potential turning point for Ethereum. The Ethereum Co-founder noted:
 

Honestly, I think doing a modest gas limit increase even today is reasonable. The gas limit has not been increased for nearly three years, which is the longest time ever in the protocol’s history (that 2x bump in the chart in late 2021 is “fake”, in that it reflects the EIP-1559…]]></summary>
