Letting go of the fiat world also means being able to let go of Bitcoin. Let me explain by telling you a story about how I died.
I grew up in Germany as the oldest of four brothers. My father worked at the local energy company but outside of that he was always politically active. Aged 16, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) — equivalent to the Democrats in the USA. His
life, and therefore mine, was dominated by the SPD. He spent a lot of time helping with campaigns and doing political work; sometimes it felt like he had forgotten that he had kids. But that was okay. One day he asked me and my brothers if he should r…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gold has played a vital role in economics and politics, influencing much of human financial activity through shifts in economic systems. It has proven versatile and stable across upheavals and social changes. It even became a vital tool in global trade and currency exchange as we know it today.
In the 19th century, gold was the backbone of the global monetary system. Nations relied on the gold standard until the Great Depression and World War I. These events were significant inflationary catalysts, and economies, in a decades-long transition, abandoned the gold standard. 
This process culminated in 1971 when the Federal Exchange could no longer exchange US dollars for gold. In 1976, the gold standard was abandoned entirely, and gold became a free asset.
Today, it is still considered a reli…]]></summary>

In a letter sent to the publication by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the central bank of the United States is claiming that Bitcoin Magazine merchandise that parodies its services are not protected speech, but rather an unauthorized infringement of its image and trademarks.
The dispute centers around the use of the FedNow Service image and trademark in a line of merchandise sold by Bitcoin Magazine that seeks to criticize the surveillance capabilities of the FedNow system, and how it threatens American civil liberties.

The Role of Ordinals in Bitcoin
Bitcoin ordinals refer to the unique identification numbers assigned to each satoshi on the blockchain. They serve as a timestamp and help establish the order in which satoshis occur. Ordinal theory enables participants to verify the chronology of satoshis, ensuring that the network reaches a consensus on the state of the blockchain.
When a Bitcoin transaction takes place, it is recorded on the blockchain, which is essentially a decentralized ledger. Each satoshi is assigned a unique ordinal number, which acts as a digital fingerprint. This ordinal number is generated using complex cryptographic algorithms, making it virtually impossible to tamper with or forge.
By using ordinal numbering, Bitcoin ensures that all participants can a…]]></summary>

In light of this renewed interest and to encourage further discussion, let's review some of Liquid's current covenant offerings, comparing them with the leading proposals on Bitcoin and examining their respective use cases.
History of Covenants on Liquid
Covenants on Liquid can be traced back to the deployment of the first Elements sidechain, Alpha. This sidechain introduced the opcodes OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK (CSFS) and OP_DETERMINISTICRANDOM along with a number of others to Elements. Alpha also enabled fixed versions of opcodes disabled in early Bitcoin, such as OP…]]></summary>

I was not impressed. I told him he sounded crazy and that was that, or so I thought. He brought up the conversation again maybe a week or two later. But this time he made sense, I could understand more of what he was saying and I could see how passionate he had become about it. Don’t get me wrong he still sounded like a lunatic (I think his eyes were even glowing) but he clearly did some reading and was able to communicate what he learned to me in a way I could understand. From then on, we were in it.

With a strategic approach to accumulating the Bitcoin through the entirety of the most recent bear market, the company is now sitting on a nearly $1 billion gain.
MicroStrategy's journey into Bitcoin began in August 2020 when it first announced its entry into the world of digital assets. The company's initial investment, at a cost basis of $4.68 billion, has now soared in value to $5.62 billion, representing a $932 million profit, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.
This increase in MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings has only reinforced Saylor's unwavering confidence in the digital currency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that showcases the expanding demand for Bitcoin, St. Galler Kantonalbank (SGKB) has become the latest major Swiss bank to offer Bitcoin and crypto buying services.
Announced Thursday, SGKB partnered with SEBA Bank to offer its retail customers cryptocurrency trading and custody services, a venture that marks another step in the expanding world of crypto adoption within the Swiss banking sector.
SGKB already enabled the service for high net worth clients.
The partnership between SGKB and crypto bank SEBA was forged earlier this year, and after a swift implementation phase, SGKB is now facilitating the trading and custody of digital assets, starting with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).
This move follows Zuger Kantonalbank's recent launch of a similar crypto offering in late October and Luzerner Kantonalbank, which debuted its service in August.
Falk Kohlmann, Head of Market Services at St. Galler Kantonalbank, expressed enthusiasm for the development, stating: "We are pleased to offer access to digital assets and the digital economy to a select group of customers."
It's important to note that, initially, SGKB's crypto offerings are limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, upon request, clients may explore investments in other cryptocurrencies. According to SEBA's website, the crypto bank provides cold storage for a range of digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, and others.
Looking ahead, the move enables SGKB clients to manage their cryptocurrencies alongside existing investments, a development that could become increasingly common in the years ahead.
With SGKB, the fifth largest cantonal bank, joining the Bitcoin fray, the path to mainstream adoption becomes increasingly clear.]]></summary>

The purchase came as Bitcoin's price has been experiencing upward momentum, reaching a recent yearly high of $35,000.
The company initially entered the Bitcoin market in August 2020, making a significant initial investment of $250 million into BTC. Since then, they have consistently added to their Bitcoin holdings, creating a treasury reserve strategy that has garnered over 158,400 bitcoin worth more than $5.4 billion at the time of writing. The company has acquired 6,067 bitcoin since the end of Q2 for $167 million.
“We further increased our total bitcoin holdings to 158,400 bitcoins, adding 6,067 bitcoins since the end of the second quarter,” said MicroStrategy Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Kang. “Our commitment to acquire and hold bitcoin remains strong, especially with the promising backdrop of potential increased institutional adoption.”
