        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friday morning, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) solicited comments on 21 Shares and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest's spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, further delaying the process.



This is the second delay in the listing process for this ETF, with the first delay happening earlier this year. The third deadline for the SEC's decision is scheduled for later this year for November 11. If the SEC delays the application again, it will go to its fourth and final deadline on January 10, 2024. 
The race for approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States gained huge momentum earlier this year when the worlds largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed for one of their own. After that, big institutions including Fidelity, VanEck and WisdomTree among others, piled in and filed for their own spot Bitcoin ETFs.  
The first mover advantage of being the first to have its Bitcoin ETF approved and listed may prove to be vital in its performance. Galaxy Digital CEO and billionaire Mike Novogratz said in an earnings call earlier this week, "The news of both BlackRock filing ETF and quite frankly, Invesco plus Galaxy, we're going to fight like cats and dogs to win market share there once it gets approved. It's a big, big deal."
Earlier this year on July 27, the SEC approved a leveraged, 2x Bitcoin futures ETF, which leaves many scratching their heads as to how that is safe for investors, but not a spot ETF. Grayscale, who is currently in a legal battle with the SEC over the denial of its spot Bitcoin ETF application, sent a letter to the U.S. Court of Appeals protesting exactly this.

Robinhood Markets recently defeated a group of investors as a United States Federal Appeals court just dismissed the appeal of a class action lawsuit against the crypto and stock trading firm.
 
Appeals Court Throws Out Case Against Robinhood
 
The lawsuit’s background dates back to January 2021, when Robinhood placed restrictions on trades of certain volatile “meme” stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. The limits, including temporarily preventing buys of some stocks, outraged users who couldn’t take advantage of price swings. 
 
 
As a result, the stock trading platform was taken to court in September 2021 by 16 investors who claimed Robinhood prioritized its interests over us…]]></summary>

I didn’t get interested in Bitcoin because of its ability to solve financial issues. My background is in investing in climate tech. When I first heard about Bitcoin, I was highly skeptical and regarded it as a negative to the environment. However, I was persuaded to put prejudice to one side and evaluate it as I would any other technology I was doing due diligence on. After evaluating the claims and data from both sides I reached the conclusion that on net balance, Bitcoin had the unique ability to solve more than one difficult-to-solve climate-change issue.
First, some context: I have been a climate activist since the 1990s. Several years ago, I channeled this …]]></summary>
