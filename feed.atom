What Needs To Happen For Bitcoin To Recover
 
Willy Woo mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin will recover when the “weak miners die and hash rate recovers.” He further explained what it means for BTC to shed weak hands, stating that “inefficient miners running old hardware and high costs go into bankruptcy.
