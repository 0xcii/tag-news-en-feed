        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion by Thabo P. Ncube, a Bitcoiner who lived through Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation in 2008.
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the fiat custodian and lender of last resort in the country, recently “liberalized” its much-vaunted foreign exchange auction trading system in hopes of selling foreign currencies at market-determined exchange rates through regulated banks.
Zimbabwe uses a multi-currency system, with 80% of its economy being dollarized, according to economists. The black-market rate for the U.S. dollar (USD) has recently been twice as high or even higher than the official rate backed by the RBZ.
In January 2023, the local Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL) was trading at about ZWL$705 to $1, but on June 7, 2023, just after the bank’s pivot, the official price was about ZWL$4,868 t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In yet another blow to the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, Arbitrum based protocol Rodeo Finance has fallen victim to attack, resulting in the loss of approximately 810 Ethereum (ETH), equivalent to $1.5 million. The incident highlights the ongoing security challenges faced by the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem.
 
Blockchain security firm PeckShield, at the forefront of detecting such exploits, was quick to identify the attack today. PeckShield flagged the vulnerability in Rodeo Finance. Via Twitter, the PeckShield Alert account alerted the project, stating, “Hi, Rodeo Finance, you may want to take a look at this Arbitrum transaction hash.”

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-eth-over-1900-as-greenback-weakens-on-tuesday/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-11T12:34:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum moved briefly above the $1,900 level on Tuesday, as the U.S. dollar weakened versus several G7 currencies. The biggest fall came versus the British pound, with USD/GBP hitting a 15-month low. Bitcoin also rose higher, climbing past $31,000 earlier in the day. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved back above the $31,000 level in today’s session, as the U.S. dollar weakened across the board.
 
BTC/USD surged to an intraday peak of $31,026.08 earlier in today’s session, which comes after dropping to a low of $30,156.54 on Monday.
 
Price has since slipped, dropping as volatility in the market remains high ahead of tomorrow’s inflation report from the United States.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to jump past a ceiling at 61.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 58.96, with the next visible point of support at 55.00.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average has edged even closer to its 25-day (blue) counterpart, increasing the chances of a downturn.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) briefly rose over the $1,900 zone in today’s session, after nearly falling below $1,800 in recent days.
 
After hitting a low of $1,860.62 to start the week, ETH/USD rallied to a high of $1,905.46 on Tuesday.
 
However, like bitcoin, ethereum has since shifted lower, as the cryptocurrency consolidated for a fifth straight session.
 
 
As of writing, ETH is trading at $1,870.15, with the RSI at a reading of 50.43, which is marginally below a ceiling at 51.00.
 
In the event the index is able to rise above the 51.00 zone, there is a strong possibility that ethereum will be back over $1,900.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Egyptian fintech startup Masroofi recently raised $1.5 million through an investment round supported by unnamed investors. The capital raise came shortly after Masroofi’s co-founders reportedly rejected a funding offer from investors in the “Shark Tank” program. 
 
Investors Drawn by Fintech Startup’s Focus on Children
 
Masroofi, the Egyptian fintech focused on electronic payment services for children, recently raised $1.5 million via an investment funding round. The raised capital is expected to fund the fintech startup’s operational and expansion activities. According to a report, Masroofi was able to raise $1.5 million after the company’s directors reportedly rejected funding from investors in the “Shark Tank” program.
 
As explained in the African Heroes report, the unnamed participants in Masroofi’s investment round were drawn by the fintech’s focus on the 20 million Egyptian youth aged between five and 20. The track records as well as the rapport between the fintech startups’ co-founders are the other factors that had a positive influence on investors.
 

 
Meanwhile, the report revealed that Masroofi is hoping to reach two million young people within five years. The fintech is also reportedly aiming to grow with its young customers by catering for their evolving needs through the provision of product offerings such as neo banking services.
 
While the co-founders Mostafa Abdel-Khabeer and Sayed Hosni are said to be confident of the fintech sector’s capacity to continue leading Egypt’s startup market, the Africa Heroes report suggested that there is still room for improvement. The report identified Egypt’s remittances and installment payments market as areas which can be bolstered by emerging financial technologies.

Seira argues that the SEC is exceeding its jurisdiction, with Paradigm echoing this sentiment in the filing. They contend that this regulatory approach constitutes an unwarranted expansion of the Howey test.
