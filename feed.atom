Ethereum Hit The $10 Billion Milestone Faster Than Microsoft, Zoom
 
Records showed that Ethereum took roughly seven years to mint $10 billion in revenue, based on spot ETH rates, and was only eclipsed by Alphabet, which took approximately six years, according to data compiled by Token Terminal, an analytics platform. 
 
Comparing this performance with other technology firms, for example, Microsoft, it appears that Ethereum found rapid adoption, and its solutions were embraced faster. Microsoft took almost 19 years to achieve this milestone, while Adobe took rou…]]></summary>

The federal agency responsible for regulating US securities markets, the SEC, has filed limited objections and reservations of rights in response to Celsius, citing “inconsistencies” and potential violations of federal securities laws by the US-based exchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. presidential candidate Nikki Haley has warned that China is preparing for war and Chinese President Xi Jinping intends to win. “China is an existential threat. It has spent half a century plotting to defeat us,” she stressed, cautioning that China is “building a massive cutting edge military, capable of threatening America and dominating Asia and beyond.”
 
Nikki Haley Warns of China’s Preparation for War
 
U.S. presidential hopeful and former governor of the state of South Carolina, Nikki Haley, warned in a speech at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics on her economic policy Friday that China is preparing for war.
 
“Strength and pride are essential to our national survival, especially in the face of Communist China,” she began, elaborating:
 

China is an existential threat. It has spent half a century plotting to defeat us.
 
“It’s taken our manufacturing jobs. It’s taken our trade secrets. Now, it’s taking control of critical industries — from medicines to advanced technology. In record time, China has gone from an economically backward country to the second biggest economy on earth,” the Republican presidential candidate continued.
 
“It has every intention of being the first. And the Communist Party’s motives are clear. They’re building a massive, cutting-edge military, capable of threatening America and dominating Asia and beyond,” she cautioned.
 
Haley additionally said: “In some respects, China’s military is already equal to the U.S. Armed Forces. In other areas, they’re beating us. China’s leaders are so confident, they’re sending spy balloons into our skies and building a spy base just off our shores in Cuba.” She warned:
 

Make no mistake: The Communist Party is preparing for war. And China’s leaders intend to win.
 
The former South Carolina governor also stated: “Joe Biden’s debt and deficits are weakening the dollar and empowering communist China.”

This decision is part of Bitwise’s amendment to its filing for a spot Bitcoin fund, a product the firm has been attempting to launch for several years.

Ethereum Transaction Fees Has Registered A Drawdown Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the fees on the ETH network have declined during the last few days. The relevant indicator here is the “average fees,” which keeps track of the mean fees (in USD) that users attach to their transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
 
Generally, the amount of transfer fees that users may put forth depends on the degree of competition present on the network. When the mempool is congested, transactions may get stuck for a while as the blockchain only has a limited capacity to process the transactions.
