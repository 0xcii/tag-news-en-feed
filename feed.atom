Committee and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) escalated today  
(Wednesday) after the Committee Chair Representative Patrick McHenry suggested  
that he may use a subpoena against the commission to acquire critical documents  
about former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. 
SEC Accused of "Lack of Responsiveness"         
McHenry accused Chairman Gary Gensler of attempting to

the SEC's dealings with Congress. This clash dates back to February when the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Bitcoin only exchange, Swan Bitcoin, welcomed NBA Champion Matthew Dellavedova to its team as Vice President of Business Development, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Dellavedova is most well known for his illustrious professional basketball career and achievements in the NBA, including an NBA Championship in 2016 with the Cleveland Cavaliers and an Olympic bronze with the Australian national team in 2020.
Dellavedova, who has been actively involved in start-up investing and advisory roles since 2017, is now turning his attention to the Bitcoin industry. “I’m excited to be joining Swan to help spread adoption, especially in sports and Australia, where I'm still playing professional basketball,” said Dellavedova. “It's already been a lot of fun learning from the experts at Swan, and I look forward to educating athletes, in particular, about the benefits of Bitcoin.”
His recent engagement with the Saint Mary’s men’s basketball team, his alma mater, demonstrated his dedication to introducing Bitcoin to athletes, especially in light of the recent Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rule changes that present new opportunities for college athletes.
One of the key aspects Dellavedova is focusing on is how Bitcoin can help young athletes save for their future. Given Bitcoin's inherent properties that prevent debasement, it is considered a reliable asset for long-term value preservation and appreciation.
"Matt is a savvy businessman and investor. He’s obviously a disciplined and incredibly hard worker," said Swan founder and CEO Cory Klippsten. "But the biggest reason we brought Delly onto the Swan squad is his dedication to spreading Bitcoin adoption and the audience he can reach outside the Bitcoin industry."
Matthew Dellavedova's transition from the basketball court to the Bitcoin arena exemplifies the growing interest and potential of Bitcoin in various industries, with notable figures using their influence to promote its adoption and benefits.]]></summary>

However we often forget that the cypherpunks of olde were human too — that early oversights & unresolved disagreements resulted in cumbersome idiosyncrasies that define our sacred blockchain today.
If you weren’t around in 2009 and want to get a taste of what it was like back then, come join the discussion in Ordinals land. We’re speedrunning Bitcoin Consensus.
What is the debate about?
Ordinal Theory describes how to serialize & track satoshis. These satoshis, when serialized, are called “ordinals”. We can associate chunks of data that we call “inscriptions” to these ordinals, thus creating a form of NFT on Bitcoin. It’s a simple concept…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bored-ape-yacht-club-announces-collaboration-with-iconic-japanese-streetwear-brand-bape/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-27T18:10:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Yuga Labs, creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), the team has partnered with the popular Japanese fashion brand A Bathing Ape, commonly known as Bape. They plan to unveil a new “irreverent collection” together at Apefest in Hong Kong this November.
 
BAYC Partners With Fashion Brand Bape
 
The Bored Ape Yacht Club is teaming up with streetwear company Bape for a new collection, Yuga Labs announced. Founded in 1993 by Nigo (Tomoaki Nagao) in Ura-Harajuku, Bape is a renowned Japanese fashion brand. The company operates 19 stores globally, offering men’s, women’s and children’s lifestyle and streetwear.
 
“Together, the two brands have reimagined iconic designs from Bape’s deep archives and usher in a return to the golden age of streetwear collecting,” Yuga Labs said on September 25. “With one foot in Bape’s Ura-Harajuku roots and the other in the BAYC swamp, this collection offers Bape heads and BAYC members exclusive access to apparel and accessories that reflect their shared appreciation for laid back opulence and irreverence.”
 
 
The recent news about BAYC and Bape comes after a notable decrease in the value of BAYC non-fungible token (NFT) assets this year. BAYC NFT floor prices have plummeted, and weekly sales volumes have consistently decreased. This isn’t BAYC’s first partnership with a prominent streetwear brand; they teamed up with Adidas in 2021 and also worked with music-focused magazine Rolling Stone on an exclusive cover design.
 
“As Fashion goes hand-in-hand with Web3, particularly in the current times, where the two have the power to impact each other almost instantaneously, we are thrilled to present this groundbreaking collaboration with Yuga Labs,” Thomas Hui, chief operating officer at Bape said.

This appointment comes at a crucial juncture as Ripple executives have publicly voiced their concerns and criticisms regarding the US government’s recent position on cryptocurrencies. 
 
In response, Ripple has taken proactive steps by engaging with policymakers in Washington, D.C., seeking clearer regulatory guidelines and advocating for their stance in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Citibank, a subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., unveiled its innovative Citi Token Services, a business solution designed to leverage blockchain for instantaneous cross-border transactions through the tokenization of client deposits.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-postpones-verdict-on-ark-21shares-and-global-x-spot-bitcoin-etfs/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-27T16:09:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. securities regulator recently announced a delay in its verdict on the Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF. Consequently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has marked January 10, 2024, as the decisive day to either greenlight or reject the proposed amendment.
 
SEC Pushes Back Decision on 2 Spot Bitcoin ETFs
 
A statement from the U.S. securities authority highlighted its decision to push back its judgment on the Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF, an asset-backed fund aiming for public listing. The filing for this ETF was jointly presented by Cboe BZX Exchange, 21shares, and Ark Invest on April 25, 2023.
 
This ETF joined the ranks of several spot bitcoin ETF applications, with industry giants like Invesco, Blackrock, Fidelity, Vaneck, Valkyrie, Wisdomtree, and Franklin Templeton all in the queue. Notably, the SEC had previously postponed its decision on seven of these filings, including the Ark 21shares Bitcoin ETF, on August 31, 2023.
 
Upon a detailed examination of the proposal and subsequent modifications, the SEC said on Tuesday that it chose to prolong the evaluation phase to guarantee a comprehensive review. “The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 3, and the issues raised therein,” the SEC detailed.
 
 
“I’m shocked they went this early on Ark and 21Shares. My assumption is they’re worried about the government shutdown and trying to get ahead of that,” Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said on Tuesday. In addition to the Ark 21shares filing, the securities watchdog also deferred its decision on the spot bitcoin ETF filing submitted by Global X and its listing partner Cboe BZX.
