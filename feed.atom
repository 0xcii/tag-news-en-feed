Crypto Liquidations Measure About $212 million In Last 24 Hours, 88% Shorts
 
To open any contract on the crypto futures market, the holder has to first put forth some initial collateral. A “liquidation” occurs when the holder’s bet fails (meaning that the price of the asset moves in a direction opposite to the one the investor bet on) and a specific percentage of this initial collateral has been eaten away by the losses.
 
This percentage may differ from platform to platform, but when the losses hit this mark, derivative exchanges generally forcibly close the position (or “liquidate” it).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved significantly higher on Feb. 16, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency hit its strongest point since last August. Prices neared the $25,000 mark earlier in the day, following a breakout of a key resistance level. Several factors have contributed to the rally including strong U.S. retail sales, and an easing of regulatory concerns.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) raced to a multi-month high on Thursday, as prices moved closer to the long-coveted $25,000 mark.
 
Following a low of $22,664.48 on Wednesday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $24,769.24 earlier today.
 
Today’s move pushes the world’s largest cryptocurrency above a ceiling at $24,200, hitting its strongest point since August 20 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also moved past a ceiling of its own at 65.00
 
As of writing, price strength is currently at a reading of 69.36, which is its strongest point in nearly two weeks.
 
The next visible point of resistance appears to be at the 75.00 mark, and should bulls make a run for this level, BTC will likely move well past $25,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also made considerable gains today, with prices rising to as high as $1,700.
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,700.85 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a bottom of $1,572.99.
 
As a result of this move, ethereum climbed to a two-week high, following a move beyond a ceiling at $1,675.
 
 
Since this peak, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as the RSI has collided with a hurdle at the 63.00 level.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is hovering at 61.61, which is marginally below the aforementioned ceiling.
 
Should this wall break, bulls could attempt to make further runs deeper into the $1,700 region.

One of them is the CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings, Mike Novogratz, who believes that before Bitcoin reaches the coveted half-million dollar mark, it will first recapture or surpass the $30,000 level by the end of March this year.
 
Bitcoin climbed to its highest level since August on Wednesday, advancing for a second day as a reduction in risk aversion helps to alleviate anxieties about an intensifying regulatory campaign by U.S. authorities.
