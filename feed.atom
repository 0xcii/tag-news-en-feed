Coinbase and SEC Face Off 
The legal battle between Coinbase and the SEC is  
before the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2022, Coinbase filed a

The SEC denied this request in December 2023, forcing  
Coinbase to seek judicial intervention to compel the regulator to reconsider  
its decision. The court's panel of judges expressed skepticism about the SEC's  …]]></summary>

Rispoli voiced his predictions this weekend on X, stating, “I’m 60/40 rn in favor of seeing an SEC notice of appeal but the stakes are really high for the SEC. Letting it slide (no appeal) means that ‘programmatic sales’ is a one-off loss that literally only appl…]]></summary>
