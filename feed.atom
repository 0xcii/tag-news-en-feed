Ukraine’s Crypto Sponsors
 
Part of Ukraine’s donations have come from prominent companies and figures in the crypto industry. The world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance contributed $10 million worth of crypto in February 2022 to agencies like UNICEF, UNHCR, and UN Refugee Agency to support their efforts in Ukraine. 
 
 
Polkadot’s co-founder Gavin Wood and Tron’s founder Justice Sun were publicized to have donated $5 million worth of DOT and $200,000 worth of USDT, respectively. Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin was also quick to show support for the people of Ukraine despite being born i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin snapped a three-day losing streak on Saturday, as the meme coin found a point of support. The move came as X, formerly Twitter, continued its re-brand by showcasing its new logo over the San Francisco skyline. Shiba inu surged by over 5% today.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) rebounded on Saturday, as the token ended a recent three-day losing streak in today’s session.
 
DOGE/USD hit an intraday peak at $0.07828 earlier in the day, following Friday’s drop to a bottom at $0.07653.
 
Yesterday’s decline saw the meme coin move near a support point at $0.07600, however bulls rejected a full on collision.
 
 
Although DOGE is now up by almost 2% from Friday’s low, price might have hit a wall, due to the current position of the relative strength index (RSI).
 
The index is hovering below a ceiling at 63.00, which would need to be broken, if DOGE bulls intend to secure further gains this weekend.
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is tracking at 62.53.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) continued to trade close to a two-week high in today’s session, after yesterday’s strong surge in price.
 
Saturday has seen SHIB/USD peak at $0.00000840, which comes after Friday’s low of $0.00000783.
 
This is marginally below the $0.00000845 level recorded yesterday, which was its highest point since July 14.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally comes as the RSI broke past a ceiling at 60.00, and is now tracking at 64.29.
 
Overall, this is the highest point price strength in SHIB since February 7, when the price reached a high of $0.00001449.
 
If momentum remains bullish this weekend, $0.00000890 is the realistic target for traders.

        <updated>2023-07-29T12:26:04.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum moved closer to the $1,900 level on Saturday, as cryptocurrency markets made marginal gains. At the time of analysis, the global market capitalization has risen modestly by 0.32%, mirroring the effects of Friday’s U.S. consumer sentiment report, which fell short of expectations. Contrary to the projected sentiment of 72.6, the actual figure hovered at 71.6. Concurrently, bitcoin witnessed an uptick in its price.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved above a key support point of $29,200 on Saturday, as cryptocurrency markets continued to consolidate.
 
Following a low of $29,186.47 on Friday, BTC/USD jumped to an intraday peak at $29,521.51 earlier in today’s session.
 
BTC has mostly consolidated this past week, as traders attempted to find a firm floor, after recent selloffs.
 
 
Today’s consolidation comes as the relative strength index (RSI) appeared to have found its own floor at the 43.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 43.95, and appears to be heading for a ceiling at 48.00.
 
In the event price strength reaches this point, there is a good chance BTC could be trading above $29,800.
 
 
Ethereum
 
After a volatile few days, ethereum (ETH) made strides towards the $1,900 level to start the weekend.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,881.46 earlier in the day, which comes following Saturday’s bottom at the $1,865.45 mark.
 
Ethereum has failed to climb above the $1,900 point since last Sunday, and has mostly been in a downtrend since a move over $2,000 earlier in the month.
 
 
The RSI is on the cusp of breaking out of a resistance level at 49.00, which could help tempt previous bulls to reenter the market.
 
Should this occur, the 10-day (red) moving average might also change its current course, and potentially move back over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.

In an interview, Gensler once again criticized cryptocurrencies’ decentralized nature, making it a headache of sorts for the SEC to enforce regulations and protect investors effectively.
 
Gensler’s primary message to investors is clear: be cautious when dealing with cryptocurrencies. He highlighted the prevalence of fraud and unscrupulous actors in the crypto market, describing it as “rife with fraud” and “hucksters.”
 
While acknowledging that legitimate actors are also in the space, he stressed that bad actors are far too familiar.

Disinflation And Monetary Policy
As we delve deeper into 2023, the U.S. economy finds itself at a crossroads. Disinflation seems to be setting in as a direct result of the Federal Reserve’s tightening monetary policies. This policy shift has led to a notable slowdown in the annualized sticky Consumer Price Index (CPI) over recent months. With this in view, the conversation among market participants has gradually shifted away from inflationary concerns and toward trying to understand the impact of the tightest monetary policy in a decade and a half…]]></summary>
