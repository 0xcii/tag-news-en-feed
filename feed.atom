        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump has warned that the U.S. dollar is crashing and soon will “no longer be the world standard.” The former president of the United States further warned that “we are very close” to a third world war happening. “Joe Biden has led us to the very brink of World War III,” he stressed.
 
Trump on Inflation, Dollar Crashing, World War III
 
Donald Trump released a video Tuesday following Joe Biden’s announcement that he is running for the president of the United States in 2024.
 
The former U.S. president began by outlining the damage to the U.S. economy caused by Biden in a few short years, including his “spending calamity.” Trump described:
 

American families are being decimated by the worst inflation in half a century. Banks are failing, our currency is crashing, and the dollar will soon no longer be the world standard, which will be our greatest defeat in over 200 years.
 
“Joe Biden has led us to the very brink of World War III,” Trump continued. However, he clarified: “I’m not predicting World War III but I will say this, we are very close.” He then promised that if he’s elected president in 2024, “we will prevent World War III from happening.”
 
Trump recently warned that China is trying to displace the U.S. dollar as the number one currency throughout the world. He also cautioned that the USD losing its world’s reserve currency status is like America “losing a world war,” emphasizing: “We’ll be a second-tier country.”
 
This week, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, also urged all countries to make efforts to avoid the outbreak of a new, full-scale global conflict. “We all need to work to ensure that this threat of global confrontation, of a hot, full-scale World War III should not materialize,” the Russian official said.

Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc. has signed a hosting agreement with Core Scientific, Inc. in which Core Scientific will operate and host 6,914 Greenidge-owned bitcoin miners at its facilities in Dalton, GA and Calvert City, KY. 
"The agreement with Core Scientific completes this phase in our strategy to deploy 9,150 miners Greenidge owns, and we believe this agreement will significantly improve our profitability as we move forward," said Dave Anderson, CEO of Greenidge. "We are very pleased to deploy these miners at Core's facilities, which have favorable power costs and a track record of excellent operational performance."
In addition to the hosting agreement, Greenidge announced the installation of an additional 1,500 company-owned miners at the company's existing facilities across the country. With the combination of these two initiatives and the previously announced agreement with Conifex Timber Inc., Greenidge expects to generate approximately $7.5 million of incremental annual profit, according to Anderson.
Matt Minnis, Co-Founder of Core Scientific, expressed his excitement about the partnership, stating, "Greenidge is a proven operator in this industry, and we're excited to partner with them and host their miners. We believe this is a win-win for Core and Greenidge."
The hosting agreement is set to be a one-year agreement between Greenidge and Core Scientific and includes a proceed-sharing component to recognize the contribution of miners by Greenidge and the infrastructure and operating expertise provided by Core Scientific.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
