        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spanish law enforcement said on Dec. 1 it arrested a man accused by the U.S. of conspiring with Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith to help North Korea evade sanctions. A Spanish judge released the man who has since denied the allegations.
 
Cao de Benos Released Without Conditions
 
The Spanish police announced on Dec. 1 that it had arrested a man accused by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) of contracting with jailed Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith to help North Korea evade sanctions. Alejandro Cao de Benos, who used a false identity, was caught in Barcelona while preparing to leave for Madrid.
 
According to a Reuters report, the DOJ has previously accused Cao de Benos of asking Griffith to use his expertise to assist North Korea in busting U.S. sanctions. Griffith is now serving a more than 5-year sentence for his supposed role in the conspiracy.
 

 
Following his arrest, Cao de Benos, who founded the Korea Friendship Association, appeared before a Spanish judge who has since released him without conditions. After his release, Cao de Benos immediately pleaded his innocence in a post on X (formerly Twitter). He added that there would be no extradition.
 
“There is no extradition. The US accusation, besides being false, does not exist in Spain,” Cao de Benos said on X.
 
However, according to an unnamed Spanish judicial source, the U.S. now has to formalize the process to have Cao de Benos extradited. If convicted, Cao de Benos faces up to 20 years in prison.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ethereum price has reached a new yearly high after a massive weekend rally that sent most of the crypto market into the green. This rally has put the Ethereum price above the $2,200 level for the first time in 2023, sparking speculations as to what could be behind the price surge.
 
Ethereum Following The King: Bitcoin
 
One of the major reasons that the Ethereum price rallied to a new yearly high is the fact that the price of Bitcoin is also on an uptrend. Bitcoin which is benefitting immensely from the hype around a potential Spot Bitcoin ETF approval jumped to its own yearly highs back in November, and after clearing the $40,000 level this year, the leading cryptocurrency pulled up the rest of the market with it.
