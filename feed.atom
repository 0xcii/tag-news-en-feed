This decision has sealed the transfer of custody of Kwon to authorities in South Korea, where he could face “several criminal offenses.”
Do Kwon Will be Extradited to South Korea
The appeals court highlighted that by rejecting the appeal, it upheld the previous decision of the country’s high court to extradite Kwon to South Korea and not the United States. Kwon is a citizen of South Korea.
“Deciding on the appeal of the defendant’s counsel, the panel of the Court of Appeals assessed that the first-instance court had correctly established that the request of the Republic of South Korea arrived earlier in the order of arrival c…]]></summary>

Where On Earth Is Kyle Davies?
 
In 2022, 3AC was one of the giants in the industry. The now-failed crypto hedge fund saw its collapse shortly after Terra’s crash, which sent the whole crypto market into turmoil.
 
Since then, Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, 3AC’s founders, have faced legal repercussions and massive public scrutiny. Both founders were sentenced to four months of imprisonment after failing to cooperate with authorities in the 3AC’s bankruptcy investigation.

This development is particularly noteworthy considering the spot ETFs‘ relatively short period in the market, following their approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) less than three months ago.
