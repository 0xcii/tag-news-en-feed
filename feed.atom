        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF already trading, there have been discussions about whether or not fund issuers will apply for other crypto ETFs. Specifically, market experts have questioned if the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, will file for spot ETFs for other altcoins like Solana and XRP.
 
BlackRock Unlikely To File For Spot ETFs For Solana And XRP
 
BlackRock will unlikely file for spot ETFs for Solana and XRP anytime soon. This is based on BlackRock’s digital assets head, Robert Mitchnick, who stated that the asset manager sees “very little interest” in crypto beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This suggests that BlackRock will likely just stick with its Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs rather than pursue offering any other crypto ETF.

When XRP Will Hit $100 
 
Common Sense Crypto suggested that XRP could hit three digits sometime in 2025 while stating why the crypto token is well-primed to reach such ambitious heights. First, he alluded to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s prediction that the crypto market could double by year-end and rise to $5 trillion.
