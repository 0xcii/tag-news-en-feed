Grayscale Urges SEC To Approve Options On Bitcoin ETFs
 
According to a Reuters report, in a letter sent to the SEC, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein argued that rejecting options on its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) would “unfairly” discriminate against its shareholders. 
 
Sonnenshein highlighted that the SEC has previously approved options on ETFs linked to Bitcoin futures. Grayscale’s CEO emphasized the importance of allowing exchange-listed options on GBTC and other spot Bitcoin ETFs for the benefit of investors.
