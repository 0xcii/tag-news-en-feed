Yellen and Goldman Sachs on U.S. Default, Debt Ceiling
 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated her concerns about a possible U.S. default on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday. Responding to a question about the June 1 deadline for a possible U.S. default, she said:

Nvidia Shares Shock With Bear Market Rally To ATHs
 
Nvidia (NVDA) has surprised stock market bears by revisiting all-time highs set back in 2021. The rally in NVDA share prices can be largely attributed to its leadership role in powering AI models like ChatGPT.
 
The rise in artificial intelligence recently saved tech stocks from the sting of a recession. Nvidia is a component in the Nasdaq 100 Index, which recently set a higher high.

According to a post on the Bitcoin dev mailing list, Ark offers an alternative scaling approach that allows users to send and receive funds without liquidity constraints, making it easier for recipients to get paid without an onboarding setup. Unlike other Layer 2 solutions like Lightning, Ark does not require the opening and closing of channels, reducing the on-chain footprint significantly.

Forbearance, in this context, refers to a temporary arrangement where the borrower can either reduce their mortgage payment or temporarily halt making payments altogether.

Attorney John Deaton, representing XRP holders in the Ripple lawsuit, has highlighted a footnote in Ripple’s opposition and reply briefs submitted to the court. The footnote suggests that there are “reasonable grounds” to conclude that XRP does not satisfy all elements of the Howey Analysis and may not be considered a security under federal securities law.
