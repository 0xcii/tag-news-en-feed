How XRP Price Will Rise To $18
 
Dark Defender stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the XRP price could extend toward $18.22 when Wave 3 occurs. He believes that Wave 3 will initially cause XRP’s price to rise to between $1.88 and $5.85 and could then further move to the $18 price level thanks to the Fibonacci levels, “which can extend exponentially.”
 
 
He also mentioned that the regular ABC corrective wave had been completed while noting that the only thing that could “spoil the current balance is the expanded Wave C possibility.” Th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an astonishing move, Bitcoin’s price has surged past the $47,000 mark, a feat that has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. This significant price movement can be attributed to three key factors: the influx of investments into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), notable activities in the futures market, and a technical breakout from a period of compression. Here’s an in-depth look at each of these contributing elements.
 
#1 Bitcoin ETFs See Record Inflows
 
The market observed a remarkable influx of $403 million into spot Bitcoin ETFs on February 8, signifying the third-largest single-day net inflow despite a withdrawal of over $101.6 million from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Since the launch of these ETFs on January 11, the total inflow has surpassed $2.…]]></summary>

Piers Morgan, known for his blunt takes, labeled Bitcoin traders as “mugs,” questioning the very viability of the digital currency. But Jordan Belfort, the infamous “Wolf of Wall Street,” offered a more nuanced perspective, acknowledging a shift in the investor landscape and Bitcoin’s evolving narrative.
 
 
Are Bitcoin Traders ‘Mugs?’
 
Morgan, ever the skeptic, painted a picture of a speculative bubble fueled by gullible participants. “Isn’t it just a case of enough mugs trading it with each other, making it go up?” he pondered, dismissing the asset as mere hype.
