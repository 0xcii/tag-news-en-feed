        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin has emerged as a revolutionary asset, often hailed as the “Digital Gold,” challenging traditional investment norms and reshaping the global financial landscape. Unlike gold, Bitcoin offers unique advantages that make it a highly attractive investment option.
 
 
Unmatched Marketability And Potential For High Returns
 
Bitcoin’s marketability far surpasses that of gold. The cryptocurrency market has witnessed exponential growth, with Bitcoin leading the charge. Over the past decade, the value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed, outpacing traditional markets in terms of return on investment. The increasing demand for Bitcoin and its potential for significant returns make it a highly marketable asset.

Compare this to the US, Northern Europe, or Japan, where nearly everyone has access to consistent, affordable power and a widely-accepted reserve currency like the dollar, euro, or yen.
The longer that Africans suffer from power blackouts and high inflation, the harder it is for them to get a leg up, despite their best efforts. Worse still, legacy energy and financial providers have no incentive to alleviate this issue, meaning currency debasement, debt traps, and grid shutdowns persist. 
Most might look at this scenario and conclude that the next African century will be very difficult. Despite …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A U.S. blockchain and lending startup is seeking the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s permission to issue an interest-bearing stablecoin. The startup said the digital token will be used as an alternative to existing stablecoins such as tether and USDC. 
 
Figure Technologies’ Draft Registration Statement
 
A new blockchain and lending startup, Figure Technologies Inc., has reportedly approached the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an interest-bearing stablecoin. If approved, the stablecoins, which will be registered as “face-amount certificates,” will be available to both retail and institutional investors in the U.S.
 
According to a Bloomberg report, Figure Technologies aims to offer the first stablecoin that will be regulated as a security in the United States. The company’s draft registration statement, filed under the name of subsidiary Figure Certificate Co., said the stablecoin will be issued using blockchain technology.
 
In the meantime, Figure Markets, the digital asset arm of Figure Technologies, is reportedly planning to raise $50 million at a valuation of $250 million. The funds are expected to be raised in collaboration with Jump Crypto and will be used to support Figure Markets’ operations.
 
 
Touting the proposed stablecoin, Figure Technologies, which is led by Mike Cagney, the CEO, said its digital token will be used as an alternative to existing stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. The startup added:
 

Interested in an instrument that provides yield backed by highly liquid, investment-grade assets that can be held in a digital format, liquidated on short notice and used in peer-to-peer transactions.
 
In addition to issuing stablecoins, Figure Technologies has also filed to register an offering that targets investors who are interested in earning yields with assets held in digital format, the Bloomberg report said.

CEXs may have to enhance or upscale their service to match users’ high standards if they are to compete with spot bitcoin ETFs.
