        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Judge Torres has granted the SEC’s request to file an interlocutory appeal. 
 
The decision, based on a review of the parties’ letters dated August 9 and 16, 2023, marks a significant milestone in the case.
 
The SEC’s successful request means that the regulatory body now has the opportunity to present a compelling case to the Second Circuit.
 
 However, it’s important to note that Judge Torres has only granted permission for the SEC to file the motion for an interlocutory appeal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since mid-July, Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, has encountered significant challenges in its price action following a remarkable climb to a new yearly high. 
 
However, in a matter of days, the market momentum shifted, leading to an uphill battle for bulls as they fought to defend critical support levels and prevent further declines. 
 
Nevertheless, their efforts proved insufficient, as Bitcoin has now breached the crucial $28,000 mark and its 50-day Moving Average (MA), which was previously regarded as a robust support line for the digital asset. 
 
This ongoing downtrend has intensified, with mounting selling pressure exacerbating the situation for Bitcoin.
