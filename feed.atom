What are the best multisig wallets to store bitcoin
Your Bitcoin wallet is the access to your digital funds and should be kept secure and private at all times. Online threats like malware programs, hacks and phishing attacks are always lurking behind the screen, and so is the risk of losing your own private keys, which could lead to losing your funds with no way to recover them. 
If this sounds too brutal, you should realize that the highlighted risks are real and people have lost money due to dramatic accidents. Such accidents may include leaving bitcoin in centralized exchanges that have gone bankrupt — like the recent FTX — or vanished to po…]]></summary>

Bitcoin, Ethereum Profitability Falls To 2023 Lows
 
Bitcoin’s fall from above $25,000 to the $21,000 level last week dragged the coin’s profitability down with it. Given this, Santiment notes that investors in these two digital assets are beginning to move their coins at a loss once more.
 
 
This will be the first time since December 2022 that this has happened as the crypto market started out in the year 2023 with a significant rally. For the next two months, Bitcoin and Ethereum investors would move their coins at a profit as the price of BTC and ETH rallied above $…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu started the week trading marginally higher, despite cryptocurrencies mostly consolidating on Feb. 27. At the time of writing, the global market cap is currently up 0.83%, as volatility has intensified. Litecoin also rebounded on Monday, hitting a four-day high.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) continued to move away from a recent support point to start the week, as prices rose marginally higher on Monday.
 
Following a low $0.0000124 on Sunday, SHIB/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.00001307 earlier today.
 
This move comes as the meme coin bounced from its long-term price floor at the $0.00001230 mark.
 
 
Overall, SHIB is down 7% in the last seven days, and this comes following a downward cross of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) of 14 days has also failed to move past a ceiling at the 52.00 mark
 
The index is now tracking at 50.44, which comes after bulls rejected a breakout of a floor at 49.00.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
In addition to SHIB, litecoin (LTC) also climbed higher, hitting a four-day high in the process.
 
LTC/USD moved to a peak of $95.58 to start the week, after ending the weekend trading at a bottom of $93.79.
 
As a result of today’s gains, the token is now trading at its strongest point since last week, Thursday.
 
 
The initial move came following a breakout of a resistance point of 50.00 on the RSI indicator.
 
As of writing, the index is hovering slightly above this mark, with a current reading of 50.43.
 
LTC has since declined, and is now at $94.64, which appears to be a result of price strength tracking near a ceiling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Web3 and crypto go mainstream, several decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have fallen victim to hacking exploitations, losing millions of dollars in assets to criminals. While DeFi projects seek ways to avoid this menace, the crypto platform LendHub has succumbed to the same fate, losing $6 million in digital assets to an exploit in January.
 
The latest reports revealed that OFAC-sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash remains an escape route for bad actors who want to launder illegal funds. Blockchain security platforms, Beosin and PeckShield, reported that LendHub exploiters have moved $3.85 million in ETH into Tornado Cash.
 
Both firms shared the update via Twitter, noting the hack suspects sent about 2,415 ETH worth nearly $3.85 million to Tornado Cash.
