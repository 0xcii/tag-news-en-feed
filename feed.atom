        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s recent comments that led to higher treasury yields, Bitcoin price and other cryptocurrencies experienced modest gains on Friday.
 
However, a legal action by the state of New York against Digital Currency Group, Genesis Global Capital, and the Gemini crypto exchange, alleging fraud exceeding $1 billion, created some uncertainty.
 
Bitcoin briefly dipped but eventually recovered, surging over 3% to approach the halfway mark to the key $30,000 level. Ethereum also saw a 2% increase but remained below $1,600, while most alternative cryptocurrencies were trading higher in the morning.
