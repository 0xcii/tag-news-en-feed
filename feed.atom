JUST IN: 🇭🇰 Standard Chartered’s subsidiary bank Mox starts offering #Bitcoin ETFs on its platform. pic.twitter.com/OCzGh75FKc
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 7, 2024
  
  
  
Mox launched ETFs tracking Bitcoin on August 7th, including spot Bitcoin and crypto ETFs in Hong Kong and derivative Bitcoin ETFs in the US. The bank cited a recent survey showing about one-third of Hong Kong residents engage with Bitcoin and crypto, and a similar portion would switch banks for such services.
By leveraging its lean virtual bank infrastructure, Mox can offer lower fees on Bitcoin ETFs than traditional brokerages. The bank charges 0.12% of transaction volume on Hong Kong ETFs and 0.01% per share for US ETFs.
CEO Barbaros Uygun said adding Bitcoin and crypto ETFs "empowers our customers to gain access to emerging asset classes."
As a Standard Chartered subsidiary, Mox benefits from the resources and credibility of a major global bank. Its Bitcoin and crypto ETF launch may pressure competitors to expand such offerings as well.
The move comes after successful Bitcoin ETF debuts in the US and Hong Kong amid rising retail demand. The move helps Hong Kong investors access Bitcoin ETFs and highlights Bitcoin's mainstream adoption.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump made waves at the recent 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville when he pledged to “make crypto great again” – including firing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair on his first day back in the White House.
 
Trump’s promise to oust the crypto-skeptic Gary Gensler resonated with many in the crypto industry who were concerned about the SEC’s enforcement approach to regulating the crypto space. However, a closer examination of the legal and political realities suggests that Trump’s promise may be easier said than done.
 
Legal Limits And Political Realities
 
According to a Fortune report, the SEC operates as an independent federal agency, with commissioners— including the chair—shielded by protections that prevent arbitrary removal.

Bitcoin Diamond Hands Still Comfortably Selling At A Profit
 
As pointed out by CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno in a new post on X, the BTC short-term holders have capitulated during this latest downturn in the market.
 
The “short-term holders” (STHs) make up for one of the two main divisions of the Bitcoin userbase done on the basis of holding time, with the other group being called the “long-term holders” (LTHs).
 
The cutoff between the two groups is 155 days, with investors who have been holding since less than this time falling into the STHs and those with more qualifying as LTHs.
