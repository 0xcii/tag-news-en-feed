        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“The institutions are coming.”
Anyone who’s been in the Bitcoin space for any significant period of time has heard some prominent figure within the space utter this phrase.
In August 2020, when MicroStrategy, an American-based business software company, announced it would be purchasing bitcoin to add it to its treasury, many thought that was the beginning of the institutional stampede.
But it wasn’t.
Sure, Tesla bought some bitcoin the following year, only to dump 75% of it soon after.
And so from 2020 through 2023, MicroStrategy was an anomaly. During these years, the company — led by Bitcoin permabull Michael Saylor — remained the only major corporation on Earth to convert a notable portion of its treasury into bitcoin.
Saylor’s vision to get MicroStrategy on a bitcoin standard hasn’t wa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP has largely had a lackluster price movement in recent months, although it continues to show promise for real-world utility. Particularly, the price of XRP was recently rejected at $0.66 after a little surge which saw it falling back down as far as the $0.42 price level. The crypto now finds itself ranging between $0.6 and $0.4, which means it has failed to break over new price territories for the past two years. 
 
While some analysts see this trend as XRP still being undervalued, others are of a pessimistic outlook. Analyst Josh Olszewicz is part of the latter group of crypto analysts. In a recent analysis, Olszewicz noted the “dead” state of XRP while discussing the current state of altcoins.

The “short-term holders” (STHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. These investors make up one of the two main divisions of the BTC market, with the other cohort being known as the “long-term holders” (LTHs).
