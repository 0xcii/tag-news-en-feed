Cost Of A 51% Attack On The Bitcoin Network Today
 
In a new post on X, analyst James V. Straten has provided an estimation for the cost of a 51% attack on the BTC blockchain. A “51% attack” in the context of Bitcoin is when a single group takes control of more than 50% of the hashrate on the network and thus, effectively gains hold of the blockchain as a whole.
 
The “hashrate” here refers to a measure of the total amount of computing power that the miners have connected to the BTC network right now. The metric is measured in terms of “Exahashes per second” (EH/s).
 
 
Here is a chart that shows how the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate has changed over the past y…]]></summary>

 Those charges include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Bankman-Fried will be sentenced on March 28 next year, although he faces a second trial on March 11 for five other charges.
