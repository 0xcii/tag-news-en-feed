        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The  
difficulty of mining Bitcoin (BTC) has surged to unprecedented levels,  
intensifying competition among publicly listed cryptocurrency miners from Wall  
Street and putting pressure on their profit margins. Despite the “miners go  
BRRR” (reference to a popular money-printing meme) at full speed, it's insufficient to keep up  
with the increase in network complexity.
Bitcoin Mining Difficulty  
Reaches All-Time High, Squeezing Bitcoin Miners Profit Margins
According  
to data from crypto-mining tracker CoinWarz,  
mining difficulty increased by 3.5% on Wednesday, reaching a new record high.
