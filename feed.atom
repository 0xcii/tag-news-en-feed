On Monday, a US bankruptcy court approved its plan to repay customers using up to $16.5 billion in recovered assets. The approval signals a win for the company’s efforts to right the wrongs that caused its collapse.
 
 
US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey, presiding over the case, called FTX’s resolution “a model case” for handling such complex Chapter 11 filings. The approval offers hope for FTX customers, many of whom have been waiting since 2022 to recover their funds.

Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Price Crash Amid Market Uncertainty
 
Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices have crashed amid market uncertainty, thanks primarily to the macro side.
