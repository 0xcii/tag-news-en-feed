        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year, there has been a flurry of news reports and opinion editorials discussing an alleged de-dollarization trend amid a wave of disclosures associated with the BRICS bloc. In a recent article, the American political scientist and author Ian Bremmer insisted that claims of the U.S. dollar dying are overblown. In addition to Bremmer’s comments, economist Paul Krugman also asserted in a recent op-ed that the greenback isn’t going away anytime soon and called some of the speculators “‘Weimarists,’ people who are always predicting hyperinflation.”

Bitcoin Correlation To Gold Has Increased During The Past Year
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the correlation between the two assets remained high during the recent US banking crisis. The “BTC correlation to Gold” indicates how closely Bitcoin is following the movements taking place in the price of one troy ounce of Gold.
 
When the value of this metric is negative, it means BTC is currently responding to movements in the price of Gold by traveling in the opposite direction. On the other hand, positive values of the indicator imply the two assets are moving in a similar trajectory right now.

Tether’s growth is approaching the high of $83 billion in stablecoins in circulation that the project saw almost a year ago, in May 2022.
 
Tether Supply Is Nearing Its All-Time High
 
The stablecoin market has recently contracted and is currently hovering around $131.94 billion. The decrease in the stablecoin market can be attributed to several dollar-pegged coins that have reduced their token supplies. In the last month, usd coin (USDC) has decreased its supply by 12.6%, while binance usd (BUSD) has seen an 18.9% reduction in supply. Additionally, Makerdao’s DAI has experienced a 9.8% decrease in supply, and Tron’s USDD…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin rose by over 6% to start the week, as prices moved back towards a key resistance level. The meme coin moved higher for a fifth straight session, despite the cryptocurrency market falling by 1.54% as of writing. Avalanche also climbed, hitting a two-month high.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) rose by as much as 6% on Monday, as prices surged for a fifth consecutive session.
 
Following a low of $0.08858 on Sunday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.0946 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw dogecoin close in on a key resistance at the $0.0960 level, which was last hit on April 5.
 
 
Looking at the chart, one of the catalysts of today’s surge in price was a breakout that occurred on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, price strength has moved beyond a ceiling at the 61.00 mark, and is tracking at 62.87
 
An upcoming wall at 65.00 could be a hurdle for current bulls. However, should they overcome this, there is a good chance that DOGE moves back above $0.1000.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
In addition to DOGE, avalanche (AVAX), was another notable gainer in the market to start the week.
 
AVAX/USD climbed to an intraday high of $21.011 on Monday, following a low of $19.04 during Sunday’s session.
 
As a result of Monday’s surge in price, avalanche has hit its highest point since Feb. 22.
 
 
This has resulted in the token briefly breaking out of a point of resistance at $20.90, however gains have since slipped.
 
It appears that momentum was caught short following the RSI colliding with its own ceiling at the 73.00 mark.
 
Although the index is now tracking at 73.17, earlier bulls seem to be more tentative, and are moving to secure gains.
