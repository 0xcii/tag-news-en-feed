Genesis Faces Regulatory Consequences
 
Before the start of the bear market in late 2021, Genesis’ lending practice was associated with failed firms such as hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research, which led to its bankruptcy in early 2023.

Only One Will Win Bitcoin ETF War?
 
Many ETF issuers offered low fees to attract more investors to choose them over their competitors. Some of them, like Fidelity and Bitwise, even offer to waive their management fees for the first six months.
 
However, with many options, the question of who will be the winner among the ETF issuers prevails. CEO of Galaxy Digital, Michael Novogratz, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ on January 11 to discuss this matter.

With BTC often considered digital Gold considering its finite supply, could the top cryptocurrency by market cap see a similar 360% post-ETF launch rally following in the footsteps of SPDR Gold Shares – the first gold-backed ETF launched in 2004?
 
Gold Rallied 360% After ETF Launch
 
At the moment, it still isn’t clear if the Bitcoin ETF approvals were a “sell the news event” or if it is a catalyst for further rally. However, considering the potential for billions of dollars in inflows into these newly launched funds combined with the fact BTC is the most scarce asset in human history, price appreciation seems to be a given eventually.

Ethereum ecosystem co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed an increase in the network’s gas limit. This adjustment, aimed at augmenting network capacity, could potentially lower costs for users and enhance transaction efficiency.
 

 
Ethereum’s gas limit is the ceiling for the total amount of gas allowed in a single block. Gas, a fee necessary for conducting transactions or executing contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, ensures the network’s operational fluidity. Presently, the gas limit stands at 30 million.
