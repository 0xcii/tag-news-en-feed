It has been revealed that SBF used a virtual private network (VPN) to watch the Super Bowl through a foreign subscription service he had purchased before his arrest. Prosecutors, however, are skeptical and argue that VPNs are commonly used to access international crypto exchanges that are blocked in the United States.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-matic-rallies-hitting-fresh-10-month-high/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-17T16:32:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon has extended recent gains, with prices climbing to a fresh ten-month high during Friday’s session. The token has now risen for a fourth consecutive session, and is up 13% from the same time last week. Polkadot also rallied on Friday, colliding with a key resistance level in the process. 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) rose for a fourth consecutive session on Friday, pushing prices to a fresh ten-month high.
 
Following a low of $1.36 on Thursday, MATIC/USD rallied to an intraday high of $1.48 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move pushed polygon to its strongest point since April 22, when prices were at a peak of $1.50.
 
 
Overall, this latest rally comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) raced past a higher ceiling at 70.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 73.23, which is its highest reading since late January.
 
Should momentum continue in this direction, there is a good chance that MATIC could move back above $1.50.
 
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) also surged in today’s session, as prices ran into a key resistance level earlier in the day.
 
DOT/USD hit a peak of $6.80 on Friday, which comes less than 24 hours after it traded at a floor of $6.31.
 
This resulted in polkadot breaking out of a long-term resistance point at the $6.75 mark, four days after trading at support of $6.15.
 
 
A major contributor to the move was the fact that the RSI moved beyond a ceiling at 58.00, and it is currently tracking at 59.02.
 
DOT bulls likely have a target of $7.00 in the coming days, with an upcoming resistance of 62.00 on the index a possible banana skin.
 
As of writing, polkadot is up almost 9% from the same point last week.

Matrix Movie, An AI Prophecy?
 
In fact, the Matrix (1999), is considered to be some sort of a prophecy of how artificial intelligence would evolve, which is embraced by the modern world today.
 
Although it is not specified in the original film, most fans assume that the Matrix takes place in the late 22nd century. The events of the film take place in a virtual environment that is meant to imitate the late 20th century, so the precise year is unknown.

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell sharply below a high above $25,000 on Friday, as crypto markets moved into consolidation.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $23,460.76 during today’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $25,134.12.
 
The sell-off seems to have occurred as a result of bitcoin bulls being unable to maintain a breakout of a ceiling at $24,200.

At the time of writing, SHIB is trading around $0.00001315, down 4% in the last 24 hours. The below chart shows the trend in the price of the meme coin over the past week.
 

 
 
As you can see in the above graph, while Shiba Inu has seen some decline during the last day, the coin is still in the green for the past week. At its about 7% gains in this period, the asset edges out the rival coin Dogecoin‘s 5% profits.
