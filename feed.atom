        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase, a leading crypto asset exchange, is at a pivotal juncture with the recent advent of US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). While this development signals a mainstream breakthrough for crypto, it also places Coinbase in a spotlight fraught with potential rewards and significant risks.
 
The approval and commencement of the first spot exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have marked a significant moment in BTC’s journey toward mainstream acceptance.
 
 
This move has put Coinbase at the ‘center of action,’ as many spot ETF issuers, including industry giants like BlackRock and Ark Invest, rely on the exchange for essential services such as custodianship, trading, and lending.
