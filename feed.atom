        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last month, Japan’s official currency has dipped slightly more than 1% in comparison to the U.S. dollar. Then, on Tuesday, the Japanese yen plummeted to its weakest position against the greenback in over 20 years, a shift that came after the Bank of Japan opted to keep its extremely loose monetary policy unchanged, despite the mounting pressures of inflation and a depreciating currency.
 
Yen’s Steepest Dive in 20 Years as BOJ Stands Firm on Loose Monetary Strategy
 
The yen weakened past 143 to the dollar on Tuesday, down more than 5 yen from Friday when the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced it would allow long-term yields to rise to 1% from 0.5%. The BOJ kept its key interest rate at -0.1% and said the 1% cap on 10-year bond yields was not a fixed target but a loose guideline.

Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Has Registered A Spike Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the taker buy/sell ratio for two exchanges, in particular, has seen some very high values recently. The “taker buy/sell ratio” here is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin taker buy and taker sell volumes on a specific exchange.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the taker buy volume is greater than the taker sell volume on the exchange in question right now. During such conditions, there are more buyers willing to buy BTC at a higher price on the platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved towards the $30,000 level on Aug. 2, as markets reacted to the latest filings by Michael Saylor’s Microstrategy. In the second quarter the company reportedly added 12,333 BTC at a cost of $361.4 million. Ethereum jumped back above a key price floor of $1,850. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved closer to $30,000 on Wednesday, following news that Microstrategy added 12,333 BTC to its books in Q2.
 
After trading at a low of $28,657.02 on Tuesday, BTC/USD jumped to a high of $29,988.00 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the highest point that the cryptocurrency has hit since July 24, which is the last time price traded above $30,000.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
After its filings, Microstrategy CFO Andrew Kang said: “Our bitcoin holdings increased to 152,800 bitcoins as of July 31, 2023, with the addition in the second quarter of 12,333 bitcoins being the largest increase in a single quarter since Q2 2021.”
 
BTC’s 10-day (red) moving average has now started to gradually shift direction, after an extended downtrend.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) has found a firm support point at the 46.00 level, with price strength now tracking at 47.11.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rebounded from Tuesday’s losses, climbing back above the $1,850 level on hump-day.
 
ETH/USD rallied to a high of $1,877.51 earlier in today’s session, which follows up from a low of $1,817.92 the day prior.
 
The move saw ethereum bounce back from yesterday’s one-month low, and comes as the RSI found a stable floor at 45.00.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 45.67, with the next visible resistance level at 50.00
 
A jump to this point will likely result in ethereum trading above $1,900.

The United States has two major political parties: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. These parties are basically diametrically opposed to the other.

Both parties essentially live in two different worlds and can hardly speak to one another. This is what political polarization looks like.
This polarization has resulted in serious problems for the country. For many of us, nothing ever seems to change from administration to administration. I wonder if anyone can anyone honestly say with a straight face that things haven’t ultimately stayed …]]></summary>
