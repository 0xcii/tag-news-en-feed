Bitcoin’s Lone Wolf? Saylor Casts Doubt On Altcoin Legitimacy
 
Saylor’s stance on altcoins is about as subtle as a Bitcoin mining rig – there simply isn’t room for another top dog. He boldly claimed that the SEC will reject all applications for spot ETH ETFs, effectively throwing cold water on the hopes of invest…]]></summary>

Garlinghouse’s take on the matter was first brought to light in a social media post by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett. His comments were made in a fireside chat that took place in Las Vegas to discuss the future of digital assets.
