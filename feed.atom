        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The agreement is set to bring approximately $7.5 million of annual revenue according to Greenidge CEO Dave Anderson.
Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc. has signed a hosting agreement with Core Scientific, Inc. in which Core Scientific will operate and host 6,914 Greenidge-owned bitcoin miners at its facilities in Dalton, GA and Calvert City, KY. 
"The agreement with Core Scientific completes this phase in our strategy to deploy 9,150 miners Greenidge owns, and we believe this agreement will significantly improve our profitability as we move forward," said Dave Anderson, CEO of Greenidge. "We are very pleased to deploy these miners at Core's facilities, which have favorable power costs and a track record of excellent operational performance."
In addition to the hosting agreement, Greenidge announced the installation of an additional 1,500 company-owned miners at the company's existing facilities across the country. With the combination of these two initiatives and the previously announced agreement with Conifex Timber Inc., Greenidge expects to generate approximately $7.5 million of incremental annual profit, according to Anderson.
Matt Minnis, Co-Founder of Core Scientific, expressed his excitement about the partnership, stating, "Greenidge is a proven operator in this industry, and we're excited to partner with them and host their miners. We believe this is a win-win for Core and Greenidge."
The hosting agreement is set to be a one-year agreement between Greenidge and Core Scientific and includes a proceed-sharing component to recognize the contribution of miners by Greenidge and the infrastructure and operating expertise provided by Core Scientific.]]></summary>

Coinbase asserted in its response to the SEC that it is the “innocent investors who stand to lose the most from the commission’s abrupt about-face.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The exchange will be primarily focused on education and the onboarding of newcomers.
CoinFlip, a major bitcoin ATM provider, has launched a self-custody-powered crypto platform called Olliv. 
Olliv aims to “provide a frictionless way for consumers to buy, sell, send, receive, and swap assets securely stored on a self-custodial wallet,” according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. The company seeks to welcome new investors to bitcoin by serving as an on-ramp for those they educate through its functions as a beginners exchange.
Leveraging CoinFlip’s existing network of crypto ATMs and customer service, Olliv “serves to bridge the gap between physical and digital investing, expanding accessibility to this emerging technology,” the press release states. Coinflip currently operates one of the largest bitcoin ATM networks in the world. Seemingly building off of this, the company says it plans to offer an intuitive interface for secure transactions, as well as 24/7 live customer service, in addition to providing educational resources via user-friendly content features.
"We envision a future where everyone can participate in the digital economy and utilize their holdings to make everyday purchases and gain access to previously hard-to-buy assets such as precious metals, real estate and energy, without the need for frustrating third-party intermediaries," said Rory Herriman, Chief Technology, Digital and Strategy Officer of CoinFlip. "Our vision for Olliv is to innovate and break down barriers around safety, security, and sovereignty to empower people to invest and give them individual ownership of their assets thanks to the accessibility cryptocurrency provides." 
Olliv is available for residents in the United States and Puerto Rico, except for Alaska, Iowa, New York, Oregon, Nevada, Arkansas, Louisiana and Vermont with intentions to expand in accordance with local regulation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
