One of the most underestimated threats that modern society faces is the ever tightening grip of centralized control. History has shown us time and again that centralized control inevitably devolves into tyranny, eroding the foundations of liberty upon which free societies are built. The 10 planks of communism, as outlined by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in The Communist Manifesto, that serves as the blueprint for transitioning society to a collectivist system cannot be implemented without centralization first occurring; due to the fact that c…]]></summary>

Alderoty shared a part of the Judge’s statement in the case of NCPPR v. SEC in an X (formerly Twitter) post. In that case, the Judge remarked that the SEC’s rules were “so vague and loosey-goosey that nobody knows whether they will be at risk from not asking.” The case involves NCPPR challenging a ruling by the SEC about a proposal not being included in Kroger’s proxy statement.
