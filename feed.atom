        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bankrupt  
crypto exchange, FTX, and its debtors have suggested reducing the maximum settled value for "small estate claims" from $10  
million to $7 million. The change followed opposition by the US Trustee to the settlement proposal previously put forward by the exchange.
FTX Adjusts Terms for Small Estate Claims
The FTX and its debtors in a court document filed on Sunday noted that the  
US Trustee, which is the office in the US Department of Justice that oversees  
the administration of bankruptcy cases, criticized the move. They argued  
that the objection should be overruled and the motion granted.
“The US  
Trustee—the sole objector to the Motion—seeks to inject itself into a  
routine settlement process that is already adequately safeguarded by two  
different creditor committees,”…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-eth-consolidate-following-last-weeks-losses/"/>
        <updated>2023-08-21T13:38:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded from this weekend’s low on Monday, as markets attempted to consolidate following recent losses. The cryptocurrency rose back above the $26,000 level, after a brief stint below this point. Ethereum also settled, after declines over the weekend.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was marginally higher to start the week, as the cryptocurrency climbed back above the $26,000 level on Monday.
 
Following a low of $25,919.02 on Sunday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak at $26,260.68 earlier in the day.
 
Overall, bitcoin traders seem to have found a semi-stable floor around the $25,900 mark, and now look set to potentially recover some of last week’s gains.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Looking at the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 20.57, which is still deep in the oversold region.
 
This could work out to benefit bulls however, as bearish momentum may be fully exhausted after last week’s run.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was marginally higher on Monday, as price continued to settle around a new support point.
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,692.33 to start the week, as bulls attempted to take the world’s second largest cryptocurrency back above $1,700.
 
The jump in price came as ethereum settled on a support point around the $1,650 mark, with bulls using this as a point of reentry.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Similar to bitcoin above, the 14-day RSI remains oversold, and is currently tracking around the 25.00 region.
 
From the chart, the next visible point of resistance seems to be at the 31.00 level, which bulls will likely be targeting.
 
Should they break out of this point, ETH will likely move back above $1,700.

The hype centers around the possibility of multiple Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) being listed in the United States.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Trey Walsh, host of “The Progressive Bitcoiner.”
A dangerous trend has emerged in the United States that is seeing terms like “free speech,” “censorship resistant,” “privacy” and more become co-opted by those on the political right, while tools enabling these principles are argued and fought against by those on the political left. The truth is that freedom, privacy and censorship-resistant technologies are important for everyone, regardless of political leanings and they should not be politicized, lest we head down the path toward a dystopian future with no privacy or free speech guarantees, and only centralized institutions controlled by people with the ability to censor, revoke and remove important guarantees of freedom promoted in the spirit and language …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nodal Power, who mitigates methane at landfills by powering Bitcoin mining data centers, announced that the company has successfully raised $13 million in a seed funding round aimed at aggressively curbing methane emissions from landfills while harnessing their latent energy potential, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.
A significant portion of the funds has already been deployed for the construction and operation of two power plants within the United States. The first site, located in the southeast US, channels the electricity generated from landfill gas into the local utility grid. This site features data center, enabling the efficient distribution of energy between the utility and the data center. 
The second site, located in the mountain west region, boasts a pioneering off-grid Bitcoin mining data center, powered by landfill gas. Plans are in place to allocate additional funding for the development of a third site, slated for early 2024. All three sites share the common goal of harnessing renewable electricity from the methane gas generated during the decomposition of organic waste in landfills.
“We’ve developed solutions, specifically for smaller landfills, that allow us to bring these overlooked resources to market,” said Nodal Power CEO Bryan Black. “Our technology and energy first approach have the potential to make a significant impact on local energy markets.”
Nodal Power's initiative carries the potential to substantially reduce methane emissions originating from landfills. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is known to be 25 times more adept at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The company's approach involves combusting methane gas within generators, a strategy that not only mitigates methane but also cuts down on carbon emissions when compared to traditional flaring or venting practices. This process thereby transforms a previously wasted resource into a beneficial energy source.

Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Set Another All-Time High
 
As Bitcoin is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) network, chain validators called miners compete with each other using computing power to get a chance to hash the next block.
 
The “mining hashrate” is an indicator that measures the total amount of this computing power that the miners have currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
Generally, the higher the hashrate, the more secure is the network as a 51% hack becomes much harder to perform. This is, of course, given that the hashrate is also sufficiently decentralized.
 
The indicator carries more significance than just that though as it can provid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Australian securities regulator recently revealed that the crypto lending platform Helio pleaded guilty to the allegation of falsely claiming to be a holder of the Australian Credit License (ACL). For admitting to committing the offense, Helio is said to have entered a “recognisance” of $9,560 (AUD15,000) for 12 months which is contingent on the crypto lender’s good behavior.
 
Helio Said to Be in Breach of Australian Consumer Protection Law
 
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) announced on Aug. 17 that the Melbourne-based cryptocurrency lender Helio Lending has been sentenced for falsely claiming it held a credit license. According to the regulator, such a claim is in breach of section 30 of Australia’s National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009.
 
In a statement, the Aussie securities regulator revealed that the license claim was made in an article that appeared on Helio’s website in Aug. 2019. The regulator argued that Helio portrayed itself as a licensed entity when it knew full well that it was not a holder of the Australian Credit License (ACL).
 

 
Commenting on her organization’s punishment of Helio, ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said:
 

We expect entities and individuals to provide accurate information to their customers and potential customers. Helio falsely claimed that it held an Australian Credit Licence (ACL), misleading their customers to believe that they had the protections afforded by such a licence.
 
For admitting to committing the offense, Helio is said to have entered a “recognisance” of $9,560 (AUD15,000) for 12 months which is contingent on the crypto lender’s good behavior. However, the regulator said the second charge relating to the content seen on Helio’s website has since been withdrawn.
