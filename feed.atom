        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the  
Philippines has blocked the cryptocurrency giant Binance. This action was taken  
after the exchange was found to be operating an investment and trading platform  
without the necessary license from the SEC, raising concerns about the security  
of funds of investing Filipinos.
The commission approved the filing of a formal request with  
the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to block the exchange's  
website and other associated web pages in a meeting held on March 12.
In the letter addressed to the NTC, the SEC’s Chairperson, Emilio B. Aquino, mentioned: "The SEC has identified the  
aforementioned platform and concluded that the public’s  continued   
access  to  these   
websites or apps  poses  a   
threat  to  the security   
of  the  funds   
of  investing  Filipinos."
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new US spot bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January after gaining the SEC's approval, have dramatically shifted the crypto industry landscape, and appear to be in the process of altering traditional finance.
