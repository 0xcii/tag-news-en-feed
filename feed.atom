        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-down-10-falling-to-lowest-point-since-october/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-10T16:39:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin fell to its lowest level since October, as cryptocurrency prices plunged during Friday’s session. Overall, the global crypto market cap dropped by nearly 9% today, which seems to have been triggered by yesterday’s liquidation of Silvergate bank. Litecoin has been another notable mover, falling by over 17%.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin fell to a five-month low on Friday, as crypto prices continued to plummet, following the liquidation of Silvergate Bank.
 
DOGE/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.06302 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $0.0722.
 
As a result of the decline, dogecoin fell to its lowest point since October 26, when price bottomed out at $0.0627.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the sell-off came as the relative strength index (RSI) of 14 days dropped below a long-term floor at 30.00
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 21.52, which is very deep in bearish territory, and its weakest reading since July 12.
 
This latest slippage in price could tempt longer-term bulls to buy the current dip, however an instant rebound may not be on the cards.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) also dropped to a multi-month low in today’s session, as the token fell by as much as 17%.
 
Following a high of $84.76 on Thursday, LTC/USD slid to a low of $69.14 earlier in Friday’s session.
 
This plunge saw litecoin fall to its weakest level since New Year’s Eve, when the token dropped to a bottom at $67.57.
 
 
Overall, LTC has now traded in the red for a fifth consecutive session, and is down nearly 23% in the past week.
 
Like with dogecoin, the collapse in price has sent the 14-day RSI to an eight-month low, as it is currently tracking at 23.75.
 
A floor at $63.00 could be a target for sellers, in the event that current sentiment extends into the weekend.

Neither a vehicle for speculation nor a place to park your wealth if gold just won’t cut it, Bitcoin was intended to enable peer-to-peer decentralized transactions. Or in other words, it’s supposed to be used as money, while cutting out the middlemen.</p><p>  
In the world imagined by Bitcoin maximalists (who eschew other cryptocurrencies, adamant that Bitcoin will consume all competition, both cryptographic and traditional), all your transactions can be finalized on-chain, from picking up a coffee to buying a house.

Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Is Currently Pointing At “Fear”
 
The “fear and greed index” is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin (and wider cryptocurrency) market. The metric makes use of a numeric scale that runs from 0-100 for displaying this sentiment.
 
All values of the index above the 50 mark imply that the investors are greedy right now, while those below this threshold suggest that the market is fearful currently.
 
Although the cutoff may be clean in theory, in actual practice the values close to 50 (between 46 and 54) are considered to represent a sort of “neutral” sentiment.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell for a fifth straight session on Thursday, as markets continued to react to the Silvergate Bank liquidation.
 
The bank confirmed that it will be winding down its operations, leading U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren to blame crypto as a whole.
 
As such, less than 24 hours after hitting a hit at $21,796.12, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $19,669.92 earlier today.
