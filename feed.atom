        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Louis Vuitton is diving deeper into the world of NFTs. They have just announced a new “Treasure Trunks” collection that combines physical and digital elements. By owning these iconic ‘Treasure Trunks’, people can access future products, and experiences, and join a community of fellow owners.
 
It’s an exciting move by Louis Vuitton which helps to explore the potential of NFTs and enhance the luxury ownership experience. The digital world’s blockchain technology can now provide the same feeling of exclusive ownership as the real world.
 
By offering an unchangeable, transparent, and publicly accessible system to prove ownership, blockchain has made owning a unique digital asset like a nonfungible token (NFT) just as satisfying as possessing its physical counterpart.

According to a document filed with the Southern District of New York, the regulator claims that the crypto company failed to register with the SEC. 
 
 
Just yesterday, the regulator filed a similar complaint against the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance and its CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. Today’s action represents worsening conditions for crypto companies to operate in the United States.

        <updated>2023-06-06T13:52:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The  
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Coinbase, the largest  
cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, with operating an illegal trading  
platform that offered unregistered crypto asset securities. The securities  
watchdog also accused the platform of running a digital asset  
staking-as-a-service programme without authorization. 
SEC  
Cracks Down on Coinbase
In a  
complaint filed before a US district court in New York, SEC  
further alleged that Coinbase combines the functions of an exchange, brokerage and  
clearing agency--which are separated under US laws--without registering to  
engage in these activities.
“All the  
while, Coinbase has earned billions of dollars in revenues by, among other  
things, collecting transaction fees from investors whom Coinbase has deprived  
of the disclosures and protections that registration entails and thus exposed  
to significant risk,” SEC explained in its complaint. 
The lawsuit  
against Coinbase comes a day after the regulator charged Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange  
by trading volume, before a district court in Columbia for allegedly operating an illegal exchange, offering unregistered crypto  
asset securities to investors and commingling customers’ funds. In late March, Coinbase had received a Wells Notice from the regulator, notifying the  
Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange that it has been violating the US securities law  
by offering unregistered crypto asset securities.

SEC Alleges Coinbase Operated an Unregistered Brokerage and Committed Multiple Securities Offenses
 
The SEC is clamping down on another digital currency platform, this time targeting Coinbase for purportedly operating as an unregistered broker and infringing upon various securities laws. While Coinbase has examined specific crypto assets for compliance with the Howey test, the SEC claims that the company has listed several cryptocurrencies that fail the test or classify as investment contracts.

To provide some background, the Ordinals Protocol allows for the systematic identification of satoshis, which are the smallest units of Bitcoin. This protocol enables each satoshi to possess a unique identity, paving the way for the creation of Bitcoin-native digital artifacts known as nonfungible tokens (NFTs), where people can inscribe satoshis with customized content.
 
 
Within this context, a fascinating narrative has emerged, revealing the existence of a highly secretive group of individuals who specializes in identifying, tracking, and trading rare and valuable historical satoshis.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin plunged to its lowest point in over two months, as markets continue to react to the SEC versus Binance lawsuit. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing the crypto exchange for violation of U.S securities laws. Ethereum was also in the red, dropping below $1,800 in the process.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) sank to a multi-month low on Tuesday, as markets reacted to the news that  has been sued by the SEC.
 
BTC/USD dropped to a bottom at $25,445.17 earlier in today’s session, a day after trading at a high of $26,810.22.
 
This decline pushed bitcoin to its weakest point since March 17, when it was at a low of $24,946.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the drop in price coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) falling below a floor at 38.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 36.12, its weakest point since mid-March.
 
Despite a recent upwards crossover of moving averages (MA), the 10-day trendline has now firmly shifted direction.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) was also a victim of the recent storm surrounding the market, with prices dropping below $1,800.
 
Following a high at $1,870.82 to start the week, ETH/USD slipped to an intraday low of $1,780.21 earlier today.
 
In comparison to BTC, the decline in ETH was relatively muted, with prices hitting a ten-day low.
 
 
Overall, ethereum is now down by 6% in the last seven days, while bitcoin has lost over 8% of its value within that same period.
 
On the other hand, ethereum’s RSI reading currently sits close to a support point at 42.00.
 
As a result, bulls have moved to buy the earlier dip, with ETH now trading at $1,814.38.

The financial industry as a whole is continually shifting toward the digital space, with the global digital payments market generating almost $100 billion in revenue last year, with projections to reach $303 billion by 2030. The penetration rate of digital payments among general consumers is also growing, as a McKinsey survey from 2022 found that nearly 90% of U.S. residents are using some form of digital payments.
And the Bitcoin market in particular is gaining greater attention, as the recent U.S. banking crisis and the negative outlook of the global economy serve to drive more individuals and businesses toward this sector. Bitcoin is seen by many as a sound store of value, independ…]]></summary>

Crypto Futures Market Liquidations Spike As Bitcoin & Others Crash
 
A futures contract is said to be “liquidated” when the derivative exchange that the contract has been opened with forcefully closes the position. A platform generally does it whenever the contract accumulates enough losses to wash away a defined percentage of the margin (the initial collateral).
 
There are a couple of factors that can greatly increase the risk of a contract being liquidated. The first is naturally the volatility of the asset that the position is for. In the crypto market, most coins show a high amount of fluctuations, so it’s harder to predict how the market may …]]></summary>
