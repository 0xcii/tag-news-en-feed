        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The creators of Friendsies, a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), have come under a barrage of criticisms after they announced a “pause” in the project’s operations and subsequently deleted their Twitter account.
 
Some have speculated that this action implies the project may be a rug pull, a form of cryptocurrency scam in which the founders abruptly abandon the market and leave investors holding worthless tokens.

If SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and his agency prevail in the case, the crypto industry can expect an even tougher crackdown from the U.S. regulator. However, the motives could be highly questionable.
 
Back in July last year, CryptoLaw, a platform launched by attorney John E. Deaton, published eye-opening revelations about Gary Gensler. Deaton revealed with the so-called “Gensler Files” that the SEC chief may be acting in the interests of others.

Lebanese Pound Devaluation
 
According to several local media reports, Lebanon’s currency recently plunged to a new all-time low of 80,000 per U.S. dollar on the unofficial foreign exchange market. The Lebanese pound’s fall on the parallel market came less than a month after it was devalued by more than 90% on the official market.
