This episode underscores the intense anticipation surrounding the potential greenlighting of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a decision expected in the coming days.
 
While some see this as a historic step towards mainstream acceptance, others, like outspoken Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff, warn of a potential “buy the rumor, sell the news” scenario.
 
 
Schiff argues that the market has already baked in the excitement, creating an “overbought” condition ripe for correction. He advises investors to exercise caution and consider selling before the actual decision lands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[India has ramped up its regulatory measures against  
offshore cryptocurrency exchanges, directing Apple to eliminate the apps of  
platforms such as Binance from its App Store within the country. 
According to a report by Bloomberg, this recent escalation follows a notice from the  
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) targeting nine platforms suspected of  
regulatory misconduct in late December, signaling a tightening grip on the  
crypto landscape.
The Ministry of Electronics and Information  
Technology prompted the removal of apps from platforms  
like Bitfinex, HTX, and Kucoin, among others, from the Indian App Store. While  
these directions weren't made public, sources familiar with the matter  
disclosed this intervention, showcasing a firm stance against non-compliant  
offshore exchanges.
Intensifying Crypto Crackdown
India's stance against offshore crypto platforms  
heightened following the December 28 notification to nine exchanges suspected  
of operating unlawfully. Fearful of potential fund access loss, Indian crypto  
traders had already begun shifting deposits to locally compliant exchanges  
adhering to the nation's regulations.
 India's FIU issued compliance show cause notices to  
the offshore platforms on December 28, urging the information ministry to block  
their URLs. Additionally, Asia's second-most populous country  
implemented anti-money laundering provisions within the crypto sector, adding a  
1% levy called Tax Deducted at Source.
The step reportedly led to a migration of trading  
volumes to offshore venues. Local exchanges were affected as traders sought  
platforms that did not impose this tax, significantly reducing their trading  
revenues.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

How it came to have over 100 merchants accepting bitcoin in a 6 month period is an interesting story of persistence, passion and belief about bitcoin. It also is the story of an area whose inhabitants were proud of their beautiful city.
