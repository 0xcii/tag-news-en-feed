        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, Thursday, the last Ethereum All Core Devs meeting of the year took place. The main topic was the next hard fork called Shanghai.
 
Until now, it was unclear which Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) would be included in the upgrade.
 
Most notably, there was controversy at the last meeting over whether proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) would be included to improve the scalability of layer 2 rollups.
 
However, as Tim Beiko from the Ethereum Foundation reports, consensus has now been reached.
 
EIP-4844 is not scheduled until the fall of 2023 with a separate hard fork, meaning the Shanghai upgrade will not be delayed and can remain on the tentative March 2023 schedule.

In a blog post titled “Switch to the trusted and reputable digital dollar,” Coinbase writes that USDC is “one of the most trusted and reputable digital dollars, fully backed with high-quality reserves.”
 
To incentivize users, Coinbase has waived the trade fees for USDT/USDC all global retail customers.
 
In reference to the disastrous events of this year, the exchange states that stability and trust are of “utmost importance.” And fiat-backed stablecoins offer stability and confidence in times of increased volatility. It goes on to say:

 It is important for individuals looking at bitcoin mining for the first time to understand the importance of Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment as well the impact this has on mining profitability. Many newcomers to bitcoin mining will consult the profitability of an ASIC on a mining calculator, expecting that that profitability will stay relatively the same going forwards in the future. This is a misunderstanding as the profitability of any given machine, trends downwards over time. Increases in difficulty should be understood before purchasing an ASIC.

Bitcoin Investors Have Realized $213 Billion In Loss This Bear Market
 
As per data from the on-chain data analytics firm Glassnode, the losses realized have meant that 47% of the bull market gains are now gone.
 
When an investor holds any number of coins and the price of Bitcoin dips below the value at which the holder acquired said coins, the coins accumulate some unrealized loss.
 
If the investor sells or moves these coins at this lower price, the loss being carried becomes “realized.”
 
The “realized loss” is an indicator that measures the total amount of such losses being locked in by holders throughout the BTC network.
