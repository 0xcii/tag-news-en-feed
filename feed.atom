However, as August draws to its conclusion, and in light of a U.S. court siding with Grayscale over a legal tussle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the pair have revised their prediction, now pegging the likelihood at 75%.
 
SEC Decision Looms for Seven Spot Bitcoin ETFs
 
Barring any delays, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is poised to either greenlight or turn down seven distinct proposals for a spot bitcoin ETF.

The TVL would continue to grow into 2022 and maintain a decent level even through the initial bear market triggered by the Terra collapse. However, the glory days are long over now and the DeFi TVL is barely holding up, to say the least.
 
DeFi TVL Crashes 78% In One Year
 
January 2022 was arguably one of the best months for the DeFi TVL when the metric rose to its highest level. At this point, there was over $212 billion worth of tokens locked across various decentralized finance protocols.
 
 
However, the same month would record one of the largest crashes in the TVL when it fell to $159 billion by January 31, 2023. This crash marked the end of an era …]]></summary>
