        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-moves-above-28500-as-eth-nears-2000/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-05T13:10:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin broke out of a resistance level of $28,500 on April 5, as crypto markets continued to react to economic data from the United States. Job openings in the U.S. fell below 10 million for the first time since 2021, which comes as employers began to reduce hiring efforts. Ethereum moved closer to $2,000, hitting a fresh eight-month high today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a key resistance level on Wednesday, with traders now targeting a move beyond the $29,000 mark.
 
Following a low of $27,979.75 on Tuesday, BTC/USD moved to an intraday high of $28,739.24 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw bitcoin climb above a recent ceiling of $28,500, hitting a four-day high in the process.

Overall, it appears that the move occurred once the relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a recent floor at 58.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 62.48, with the next visible ceiling of 65.00 a possible target for bulls.
 
There is a strong possibility that BTC will be above $29,000 if and when this resistance point is hit.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also in the green, with prices climbing to a fresh eight-month high.
 
ETH/USD moved to a high of $1,921.27 earlier in the day, which comes a day after trading at a low of $1,855.37.
 
As a result of this rally, ethereum went back to its strongest point since August 17, when price hit a peak of $1,957.

This latest surge has pushed price strength to a current reading of 65.87, which is marginally below a ceiling at 66.00.
 
Due to this, some earlier bulls have moved to take profits, which has led to ETH falling from the day’s high.
 
At the time of writing, ethereum is trading at $1,915.88.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu metaverse advisor Marcie Jastrow assured in a comment on Discord yesterday that the project continues to make great progress and that new information will be announced soon. SHIB : The Metaverse is among the most anticipated projects on Shibarium and will contribute to boosting the SHIB price.
 
Every time a user makes a transaction on the Shiba Inu Metaverse, a small amount of SHIB will be burned. If millions of SHIB army members are going to use the futuristic metaverse, the micro amounts could add up and substantially tighten the supply of SHIB.
 
So it’s no wonder that SHIB : The Metaverse is getting a lot of hype, even though relatively little is still known about it. However, that could change next week.
 
Details About Shiba Inu Metaverse To Be Released

This case offers a unique opportunity to attain much-needed regulatory clarity, which could ultimately promote growth and stability throughout the sector. Ripple should embrace this prospect wholeheartedly.
 
The following opinion editorial was written by Joseph Collement, General Counsel at Bitcoin.com.
 
Recent events, such as a rise in XRP’s value and an increase in open interest in the futures market, indicate mounting optimism about Ripple’s chances of triumphing in its lawsuit against the SEC. This positive sentiment is fueled by the anticipation that a Rippl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum (ETH) has beat the resistance at $1,900 for the first time in over nine months, prompting a bullish trend for the digital asset. This was a hard-won level as ETH was struggling under $1,900 for the last week. This recovery has no doubt been a welcome development for investors but what’s driving the price?
 
Ethereum Sharks Are Driving The Price
 
According to Santiment, Ethereum shark addresses may have been behind the recent rally. In a report posted to Twitter, Santiment reveals that these accounts holding between 100-10,000 coins have been accumulating ETH at an accelerated rate over the last nine months.
 
 
In total, these shark addresses added 2.27 million coins to their holdings which worked out to $4.2 billion. This accumulation pushed their holdings to a new one-year high…]]></summary>

creation of Bitcoin in 2009, digital currencies have gone a long way. Today,  
over 4,000 distinct cryptocurrencies are in use, with a total market  
capitalization of more than $2 trillion. Volatility, on the other hand, is one  
of the most significant obstacles confronting digital currencies. 
Many digital  
currencies' values can fluctuate dramatically, making them unsuitable for daily  
transactions. Stablecoins are a novel type of digital currency designed to  
address this issue. In this essay, we will look at the future of digital  
currencies and whether stablecoins are a viable solution to volatility.

But despite its history of recovery over the years, the world’s most popular digital currency has faced its fair share of naysayers, a.k.a. “bears,” who have relentlessly predicted its downfall. 
 
Now, prominent cryptocurrency analyst and trader Bob Loukas has boldly taken to Twitter to share his expert opinion on when Bitcoin will finally be able to silence all the bears for good. 
 
With Bitcoin’s tumultuous past and uncertain future, the question on everyone’s mind is: can it truly rise above the bearish trends and become a dominant force in the world of finance?

The latest macroeconomic data and a gold price that continues to thrive may provide the impetus needed to break out of the current consolidation phase.
 
At $2,042 per ounce, gold is just a few dollars away from its 2020 record high of $2,069.40. The traditional safe haven asset is up 13% over the past month, while Bitcoin gained 27% over the past 30 days. Thus, both assets have risen in tandem (Bitcoin with a higher beta) in recent weeks.
