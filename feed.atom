In a thought-provoking conversation, Mow referenced Satoshi Nakamoto’s privacy vision from the Bitcoin white paper, emphasizing its continued relevance.
 
 
Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, envisioned a system where privacy wouldn’t rely on trusted third parties, like traditional banks. Instead, the pioneering crypto employs a system of anonymous private keys.
 
While transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, the identities of those involved remain concealed. This approach offers a unique solution to the privacy concern that plagues many digital transactions.
