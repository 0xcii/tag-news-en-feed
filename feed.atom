        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum classic was one of the biggest movers to start the weekend, as prices surged to a six-week high. The move saw the token climb by as much as 12%, breaking out of a key resistance level in the process. Polygon also moved higher, as it raced towards a recent price ceiling. 
 
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
 
Ethereum classic (ETC) rose to a six-week high on Saturday, as prices rallied by as much as 14%.
 
Following a low of $17.94 on Friday, ETC/USD raced to a peak of $20.68 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of today’s move, ETC broke out of a key resistance level of $20.00, hitting its highest point since November 26 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s surge came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Recent rallies have also pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) close to overbought territory, with the indicator tracking at its highest point since last August.
 
Earlier gains have already begun to fade, with previous bulls likely moving to take profit at the level.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was another notable gainer to start the weekend, with the token climbing for a second straight day.
 
MATIC/USD raced to a high of $0.8105, which is over 3% higher than Friday’s low at the $0.774 mark.
 
Today’s gain has pushed polygon closer to a key resistance level of $0.8200, which was last hit on December 27.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, today’s surge has also led to a collision with a ceiling on the RSI, with the index hitting its resistance of 49.00
 
Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, and as of writing, MATIC/USD is trading at the $0.8039 point.
 
In order for MATIC to extend recent gains to a third session, price strength will first need to overcome the 49.00 ceiling on the RSI.

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved closer to the $17,000 level on Saturday, as traders continued to react to the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP).
 
Last month’s NFP numbers came in at 223,000, which is 23,000 higher than expected, and this was in a month where the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by less than in previous months.
 
In response to this, BTC/USD surged to a peak of $16,991.99 to start the weekend, hovering close to a three-week high in the process.

Bitcoin maximalists have had a whirlwind of a year. From getting browbeat through the recent price drawdown to being seemingly prophetic bell-ringers of the dumpster fire that is “crypto,” much of what has been written in the mainstream remains net negative. What’s concerning is that their centralized, authoritarian counterparts (referred to here as fiat maximalists) somehow maintain an air of superiority in the mainstream. Oddly, both Bitcoin maxis and fiat maxis have some similarities in their structure. But how they each att…]]></summary>

While the crypto hiked its trading price by 3.2% during the last 24 hours to trade at $4.72 at the time of this writing according to tracking from Coingecko, the digital asset continues to struggle to regain some of its recent looses.
 
Over the previous seven and 14 days, HT has squandered 6.4% and 11.3% of its value, respectively, and is on the verge of another meltdown as suggested by some of its technical indicators.
 
The altcoin ended up being in an oversold position, making it more susceptible to a significant price decline which might come within the next few days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana, the touted “Ethereum killer,” has sustained losses in the past few months because of the bear market and its ties to Sam Bankman-Fried’s now-defunct crypto exchange FTX. But recently, the troubled ecosystem surpassed Shiba Inu and Tron in terms of market valuation. 
 
As of writing, SOL still held this advantage according to data from CoinMarketCap. This bullish action caused the crypto’s price to jump 0.9% in the daily timeframe, further beefing up its 36% increase in the past week.
 
 
Catalysts Of This Year’s Solana Rise
 
Solana has been on a roll recently because of two primary catalysts: Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, recently tweeted about the troubled ecosystem, saying now that “opportunistic money people” are gone from the platform, and Solana has a bright futur…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A top Internal Revenue Service (IRS) official says, “Cryptocurrency is here to stay,” and “it’s becoming more legitimate.” The official added that the U.S. tax authority is looking to partner with crypto companies, noting: “I don’t see how we can operate in this space without it.”
 
Top IRS Official Says Crypto Is Here to Stay
 
Thomas Fattorusso, acting special agent-in-charge of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI)’s New York office, talked about cryptocurrency in an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this week.
 
“We can’t be hostile to the technology. We have to embrace it,” the IRS official emphasized, elaborating:
 

Cryptocurrency is here to stay. As far as I’m concerned, it isn’t going anywhere anytime soon and it’s becoming more legitimate. As the years roll on, it becomes more sophisticated.
 
Fattorusso explained that the IRS is looking to partner with crypto companies. “My thought is that those relationships will develop as the years go on and [as] the companies become more comfortable with dealing with the federal government. I don’t see how we can operate in this space without it,” he opined.
 
Commenting on the IRS cooperating and partnering with crypto firms, Fattorusso shared:
 

That’s something that we’re always working toward … that’s always the end goal — to have those partnerships and to have a relationship that isn’t contentious, more of a symbiotic relationship.
 
He believes that partnering with federal agencies “helps them [crypto companies] in their legitimacy.” The IRS official added: “This is a new industry for everybody. I think we’re still trying to feel our way around it. The companies are feeling their way around it.”
 
In November last year, IRS Criminal Investigation chief Jim Lee said that the tax authority is building “hundreds” of crypto cases.
