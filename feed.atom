On X (formerly Twitter), Deaton stated, “I think I’m going to write a letter, addressed to the FSC, discussing the inadequacy of writing letters to Gary Gensler. True oversight is not about how many stern letters you write or how many warnings you give. It isn’t about voluntary compliance. True oversight is achieved involuntarily.”
