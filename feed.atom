Despite growing pressure for it to extend the period for returning the old notes, the central bank insists the Jan. 31 deadline still stands.
 
Less Than 40% of ATMs Are Dispensing New Banknotes
 
As the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s Jan. 31 deadline for returning the old naira banknotes approaches, banks in several Nigerian states are still distributing the soon-to-be demonetized banknotes, a report has said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the ongoing relief rally in the crypto market, negative news seems to be never-ending. The latest to make it to the headline today is Gemini, as the crypto exchange company has reportedly cut down another 10% of its global staff according to a recent report published by The information citing an internal message.
 
This latest headcount reduction is the crypto exchange’s third round of lay-offs in the past eight months. Its previous staff cutdown occurred last June following extreme market conditions. The company let go of a tenth of its staff. Weeks later, a report claimed that the company laid off an additional 68 employees, or about 7% of its workforce.
 
In the internal message disclosed by The Information today, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss wrote:
