        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/cypherpunk-legend-adam-back-bitcoin-is-digital-gold-for-the-next-millennia"/>
        <updated>2023-09-25T18:35:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adam Back, renowned cypherpunk and creator of Hashcash, made a bold statement on X this weekend, arguing that Bitcoin is poised to replace gold as the ultimate store of value for the next millennium. 
Back's remarks reflect his deep-rooted belief in the transformative potential of Bitcoin and its ability to outshine traditional assets like gold.
In his X post, Back said:



These words carry significant weight in the crypto community, as Adam Back is no stranger to the world of digital currencies. He has played a pivotal role in the development of cryptographic technologies and is widely recognized as a cypherpunk luminary. 
More specifically, his creation, Hashcash, laid the groundwork for the concept of proof-of-work, which Bitcoin's founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, later incorporated into the cryptocurrency's underlying technology.
Adam Back's advocacy for Bitcoin as the "digital gold" of the future aligns with the broader narrative that has been gaining momentum in recent years. Bitcoin has increasingly been viewed as a superior store of value compared to traditional assets like gold due to its scarcity, divisibility, and resistance to censorship.
As central banks continue to engage in unprecedented levels of monetary expansion, Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty has grown significantly. Investors, institutions, and individuals alike are turning to Bitcoin as a way to safeguard their wealth in an increasingly uncertain financial landscape.
Back's perspective on Bitcoin's long-term potential also resonates with his history in the cypherpunk movement, where individuals have championed the idea of digital privacy, censorship resistance, and financial sovereignty. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and cryptographic security, embodies many of the principles that cypherpunks have long advocated for.
While the debate over whether Bitcoin can truly replace gold as the ultimate store of value rages on, Adam Back's endorsement carries substantial weight.]]></summary>

Max Keiser who is a staunch Bitcoin supporter shared a patent that is more than three decades old to put forward claims that XRP is centralized.
 
Keiser Says XRP Is Centralized
 
In the post that Max Keiser made on X, he attaches a picture of a patent filing which he used to buttress his point that XRP is centralized. The patent is dated June 18, 1991, which means that it was filed 32 years ago. However, Keiser believes that this patent filed by Ripple co-creator and Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz proves that the altcoin is centralized.
 
 
The patent which would have been filed when Schwartz was a young adult, however, carries no mention of Rippl…]]></summary>

HTX exchange fell victim to a major hack on September 24, resulting in the loss  
of $7.9 million worth of digital assets. The breach was brought to light by  
blockchain analytics platform Cyvers, sending shockwaves through the crypto

However, what  
sets this incident apart is the exchange's claim to have unmasked the hacker's  
identity and a surprising offer of a "white-hat bonus" to the  
culprit, provided they return most of the stolen funds. A message, written in  
Chinese, emerged from a known Huobi hot wallet, addressed directly to the  
hacker.
HTX's  
Response
The message  
asserted that Huobi Global had successfully identified the attacker and had an  
unconventional proposition. The exchange offered to let the hacker retain 5% of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that underscores MicroStrategy's unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, the software company has added 5,445 more BTC to its corporate treasury.
The latest acquisition, made on September 24, 2023, comes at an average price of approximately $27,053 per Bitcoin, amounting to an investment of $147.3 million.
This purchase brings MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings to a staggering 158,245 BTC, acquired at an average price of around $29,582 per Bitcoin, equivalent to approximately $4.68 billion. 
MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, has been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin, touting it as digital gold and emphasizing its role as a strategic treasury reserve asset. This latest acquisition further cements MicroStrategy's position as one of the most prominent institutional investors in Bitcoin.
The move comes as no surprise to those following MicroStrategy's journey in the world of cryptocurrencies. The company first ventured into Bitcoin investments in August 2020 when it made its initial purchase. Since then, it has continued to accumulate Bitcoin, even using debt to finance some of its acquisitions.
All the while, Saylor has continued to assert that Bitcoin is "underestimated" compared to other crypto market opportunities, as this video from Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo shows. Saylor has repeatedly said that altcoins are overvalued and should be sold.
With the growing recognition of Bitcoin's value as a store of value and a potential hedge against economic uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether more institutions will follow in MicroStrategy's footsteps.]]></summary>
