Shift in House Financial Services Committee Leadership Could Lead to More Progressive Crypto Legislation
 
In a move that could impact the future of cryptocurrency regulation, U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.) announced his retirement at the end of 2024. This decision leaves a potential opening for a more crypto-friendly chairmanship of the House Financial Services Committee, following the departure of the current chair, Patrick McHenry, in early 2025 when his term ends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin breached the $47K threshold on Monday, fueled by growing excitement over the potential launch of a U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The leading crypto asset kicked off the day at $43,247 per unit, then climbed to a peak of $47,281 by 2:10 p.m. Eastern Time (ET).
 
Bitcoin Rally Tops $47K
 

 
Monday afternoon witnessed a notable surge in the market cap’s leading crypto asset, occurring around 2 p.m. ET. Bitcoin (BTC) experienced an increase exceeding $3,600 from its daily low, with many analysts linking this upswing to the potential approval of several spot bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The latest market figures indicate that bitcoin’s previous encounter with this price bracket was in December 2021, following its descent from the record high of $69K.

The market valuation of the digital currency soared, reaching precisely $917 billion, eclipsing Meta (formerly Facebook) in market size and securing its position as the ninth-largest asset by market valuation. The trading volume for BTC has intensified, contributing $37.17 billion to the day’s total $144 billion in trades. Current statistics reveal that, at 3:10 p.m. ET, BTC’s market value of $46,922 is just over 32% below its all-time high of $69K, achieved on Nov. 10, 2021.
 

 

 

 
This uptick in price has resulted in the elimination of numerous short trading positions. Coinglass’s four-hour data indicates that $73.62 million in BTC shorts were liquidated, with approximately $13.75 million occurring following the surge past $47K. This increase in bitcoin’s price has also buoyed other cryptocurrencies, elevating the entire crypto market economy to a value of $1.80 trillion. Bitcoin dominates this figure with a 50.8% market share, while ethereum (ETH) holds a 15.6% stake in the combined market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) could potentially commence live trading as early as Thursday or Friday, with approval happening this Wednesday, sources close to the matter told CNBC. 



This news comes amid intense anticipation for the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, a significant milestone anticipated to provide mainstream investors with a regulated avenue to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin.
"Two sources close to the process now telling me it's looking like Wednesday, which is also the deadline for Cathie Wood's ARK and 21Shares bid," said CNBC anchor Kate Rooney. "Then I'm told trading would happen Thursday or Friday, but it has been a moving target here on dates."
The imminent possibility of live trading for these ETFs signals a significant leap forward in the integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial markets. CNBC's report adds to the growing speculation surrounding the imminent introduction of these ETFs, which have been eagerly awaited by both institutional and retail investors.
Should the live trading commence as projected, it would mark a historic moment for the Bitcoin industry, reflecting a seismic shift in the perception and adoption of BTC among traditional investors.
While the specific details and exact launch time remain speculative, the potential realization of Spot Bitcoin ETFs trading live signifies a culmination of rigorous regulatory evaluations and market readiness, bringing Bitcoin one step closer to wider acceptance and legitimacy within the financial landscape.]]></summary>
