        <updated>2023-08-02T12:28:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved towards the $30,000 level on Aug. 2, as markets reacted to the latest filings by Michael Saylor’s Microstrategy. In the second quarter the company reportedly added 12,333 BTC at a cost of $361.4 million. Ethereum jumped back above a key price floor of $1,850. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved closer to $30,000 on Wednesday, following news that Microstrategy added 12,333 BTC to its books in Q2.
 
After trading at a low of $28,657.02 on Tuesday, BTC/USD jumped to a high of $29,988.00 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the highest point that the cryptocurrency has hit since July 24, which is the last time price traded above $30,000.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
After its filings, Microstrategy CFO Andrew Kang said: “Our bitcoin holdings increased to 152,800 bitcoins as of July 31, 2023, with the addition in the second quarter of 12,333 bitcoins being the largest increase in a single quarter since Q2 2021.”
 
BTC’s 10-day (red) moving average has now started to gradually shift direction, after an extended downtrend.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) has found a firm support point at the 46.00 level, with price strength now tracking at 47.11.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rebounded from Tuesday’s losses, climbing back above the $1,850 level on hump-day.
 
ETH/USD rallied to a high of $1,877.51 earlier in today’s session, which follows up from a low of $1,817.92 the day prior.
 
The move saw ethereum bounce back from yesterday’s one-month low, and comes as the RSI found a stable floor at 45.00.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 45.67, with the next visible resistance level at 50.00
 
A jump to this point will likely result in ethereum trading above $1,900.

The United States has two major political parties: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. These parties are basically diametrically opposed to the other. As of late, both sides have drifted to the extreme edges of the political spectrum to a point where they can’t agree on a basic set of facts about America. Both parties essentially live in two different worlds and can hardly speak to one another. This is what political polarization looks like.
This polarization has resulted in serious problems for the country. For many of us, nothing ever seems to change from administration to administration. I wonder if anyone can anyone honestly say with a straight face that things haven’t ultimately stayed …]]></summary>
