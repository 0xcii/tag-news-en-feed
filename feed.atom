Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared on X that the meme coin has seen a major rise in the number of new daily addresses. In the space of a week, new addresses being registered on the Dogecoin network daily saw a 72% jump.

After delivering his speech, titled “The Next Threat to Speech,” Snowden engaged in a Q&A session where he criticized Solana’s architecture, expressing concerns about its centralized nature and the types of projects it facilitates.
 
Responding to the question, “How do we design technology from first principles so we know it’s safe?” Snowden took the opportunity to draw comparisons between Bitcoin’s adversarial design and what he perceives as Solana’s more vulnerable, centralized system.

Bitcoin As Federal Reserve Asset
 
On the same day Lummis introduced her legislation, former President Donald Trump outlined his own vision for a “national Bitcoin stockpile,” committing to never sell the roughly 200,000 Bitcoin currently held by the US government.

Notably, Dogecoin, which ended the last days of September on a bullish run, has since reversed those gains and is back where it left off just above $0.10. 
 
According to a technical analysis of the Dogecoin price action, the meme coin broke above a multi-month downtrend last week. However, as it stands, a recent correction in the past 48 hours has seen DOGE reversing to retest the breakout point. As noted by a crypto analyst, this retest is crucial to DOGE’s performance in the coming weeks and months. A bounce or a break below could make or break the meme coin’s price.
