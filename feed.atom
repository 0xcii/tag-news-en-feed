        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The entry of PayPal into the stablecoin arena with its PYUSD stablecoin initially sparked intrigue, positioning itself as a potential rival to the likes of Circle and Tether, which command an 85% stronghold over the industry. 
 
However, the nascent stablecoin’s journey has been fraught with challenges, hampering its efforts to carve a significant niche. Critics have pointed to its centralization as a major hurdle in gaining traction.
 
 
Observers note that many tokens appear to be parked within centralized exchanges, with Paxos, the issuer of PYUSD, holding a staggering 90% of the tokens in circulation. 
 
Based on Coinmarketcap data, a substantial 47 million PYUSD tokens have been minted. Data from DeFiLlama also indicates that an overwhelming majority of these tokens have remained stag…]]></summary>

Binance Drops Five Sanctioned Russian Banks  

The named banks include Rosbank and Tinkoff, which are facing sanctions by Western countries amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russian banks were also kicked out of SWIFT, which made it nearly impossible for ordinary Russians to take their money out of the country.   

Binance’s P2P is one of the few platforms that allowed Russians to transfer funds in rubles. Another recent report by the Wall Street Journal pointed out that the crypto platform is helping Russians to transfer their money abroad, circu…]]></summary>

have flourished, leaving investors grappling with losses that have surpassed a

According to the data
