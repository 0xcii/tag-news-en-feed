The precious metal started the day trading just under $2,250, but surged to set a new record, slightly above its previous day’s peak. Amidst this surge in gold prices, the cryptocurrency sector, particularly Bitcoin, is perceived to be on the brink of significant gains.

Youssef and the global team at NoOnes are on a mission to end financial apartheid and to unite the financially disenfranchised around the world. In the process, they’re taking on the old financial guard, driven by the belief that when people can trade freely with one another using bitcoin, the oppressive powers that be will lose their leverage over those living in developing economies.

You can check a signature, you can add a timelock to something, you can manipulate data in a few simple ways, but that’s it. 
You can program a Bitcoin UTXO to require a signature check, a timelock verification, etc. But you cannot program it to unlock based on any arbitrary conditions.
