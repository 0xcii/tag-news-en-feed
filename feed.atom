        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Samson Mow, CEO at Jan3 and a staunch Bitcoin advocate, recently sparked a discussion among the crypto community, suggesting that Bitcoin’s journey to reaching a valuation of $1 million is still plausible.
 
Mow’s statement comes from views and predictions on BTC within the crypto community, including Balaji Srinivasan, a former a16z partner and Coinbase CTO.
 
Balaji’s Initial $1 Million BTC Outlook
 
In March, amid a tumultuous financial environment marked by the bankruptcy and subsequent rescue of several US banks, including those with ties to the crypto world like Silvergate and Signature Bank, Balaji Srinivasan placed a $2 million bet on a similar million-dollar trajectory for BTC.
 
 
The former Coinbase CTO mainly bet that BTC would hit a million-dollar price tag in 90 days. Balaji …]]></summary>

the crypto exchange to suspend spot trading for AEUR pairs like AEUR/USDT,

Binance detected this deviation on December 5,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase has unveiled a new feature to its wallet service, streamlining international fund transfers. This new update aims to make the transfer of funds as effortless as sending a text.
 
Coinbase Unveils Link-Based Money Transfer Service
 
Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) has launched its latest wallet feature that facilitates global fund transfers. The platform now allows users to transfer money across various channels, including widely used messaging and social media apps, by merely sharing a link.
 
Announced on Tuesday, Coinbase explained this feature circumvents the need for intricate banking details and expensive wire transactions, offering immediate settlements without charge. The update includes compatibility with various social media and messaging applications such as Whatsapp, Instagram, Tiktok, Facebook, Telegram, Snapchat, and also via email.
 
In essence, the service functions on any platform capable of sharing a link. Coinbase clarified that if the recipient does not claim the funds within two weeks, they automatically revert to the sender. Coinbase’s new payment method is akin to those provided by major payment corporations like Paypal and Stripe.
 
 
Paypal facilitates link-based transactions through a service named Paypal.me. In this service, individuals can generate a personalized link to solicit payments directly to their Paypal account. Paypal’s feature can be used for crypto payments associated with the select digital assets it supports.
 
Targeting both novices and seasoned users, Coinbase has also rolled out a ‘simple mode’ in its non-custodial wallet. This feature concentrates on core functionalities such as purchasing, sending, receiving, and safeguarding digital currencies.

“Every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods.”
― H.L. Mencken

Voting is sometimes fake, sometimes real. Elite coalitions gather behind the scenes and what you see in front of the camera is a complicated narrative dance measuring popular sentiment, which is sometimes aligned with reality and often isn't.
As the electoral engine of the United States purrs to life, many are questioning the point of it all. Events in the 21st century have shattered the delicate notions of fairness in the halls of power, or the assumption that the organs of state and industry place a priority on performing their function at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Testifying before the U.S. Congress today, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, stirred controversy by expressing his negative opinions on the Bitcoin and crypto market. The renowned banking executive stated that if he held a position in the government, he would "close down" Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.



Dimon, who has been historically critical about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, reiterated his concerns regarding how the assets can be used. He emphasized that the government has the power to enforce strict regulations or even shut down the entire crypto space.
"I've always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc," said Dimon. "The true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, anti-money laundering, tax avoidance. And that is a use case." 
Dimon's stance echoes his previous sentiments regarding Bitcoin, as he once labeled it a "fraud" and warned investors about its speculative nature. However, he has also acknowledged the underlying technology, blockchain, as having potential applications in various industries.
"It is some what anonymous, not fully. And because you can move money instantaneously because it doesn't go through know you customer, sanctions, OFAC — they can bypass all of that," Dimon continued. "If I were the government I'd close it down."
Bitcoin has faced criticism from several influential financial figures such as Dimon due to its decentralized nature and perceived risks. It is important to note that while the government could be hostile towards the industry working in the United States, no government could close down the decentralized Bitcoin network.]]></summary>

The listing of the Anchored Coins EUR (AEUR) has ended with what can only be described as a disaster that has left the exchange’s users with ample losses.
 
The Binance AEUR Saga
 
On Monday, December 4, Binance announced that it would be listing a new stablecoin called the Anchored Coins EUR (AEUR). This was another normal listing that went as planned for the exchange and trading began on the same day.
 
As a way to promote this new stablecoin, the exchange announced zero-fee trading across four AEUR pairs, including AEUR/BTC, AEUR/ETH, AEUR/USDT, and AEUR/EUR. Trading kicked off across all of these pairs on the exchange with volume coming in under $10 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DMG Blockchain Solutions, a bitcoin miner and cryptocurrency technology company, announced that the firm has purchased 4,550 T21 Antminer bitcoin miners from Bitmain Technologies. DMG detailed that it paid $12.1 million for the next-generation application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners which equates to $14 per terahash a second (TH/s).
 
DMG to Expand Fleet With Latest Purchase From Bitmain
 
DMG has revealed it has purchased 4,550 T21 Antminers from Bitmain and it expects to get 1.06 exahash per second (EH/s) from the new units. The firm detailed that the miners cost $12.1 million and were financed through both cash and liquidated bitcoin (BTC). The mining firm is expecting the units to arrive sometime in March 2024.
 
The T21 Antminer produces 190 TH/s but can be overclocked to 233 TH/s, DMG detailed in its announcement. The company aims to ship the miners to the firm’s Christina Lake data center facility. “DMG is planning to utilize its previously purchased mining containers, which are in the process of being installed at its Christina Lake facility in advance of taking delivery of the T21 miners,” the company said in a statement.
 

 
DMG added:
 

This new fleet, in combination with expected rationalization of its existing fleet, will help DMG improve its overall fleet efficiency anticipated to be below 25 J/TH post-halvening, which is expected in April 2024.
 
The news follows several mining operations acquiring ASIC bitcoin mining machines. Iris Energy just recently acquired 7,000 T21 Antminers from Bitmain and Riot Platforms secured 66,560 ASICs or 18 EH/s from Microbt. DMG mined 64.7 BTC in November and by the end of the month, the firm held a total of 429 BTC worth $18,801,182 using prevailing exchange rates.

I'm sure Naka thought this over. His first Bitcoin must have had an incremental reduction of the supply per block. But the final design, the one we know, cuts the block reward in half only after every 210,000 blocks (every four years). Obviously, this decision had a tremendous impact on price action, volatility, and adoption. Unfortunately, it’s not the best supply scheme. Let's explore.

Bitcoin, as we know it, has a supply schedule adhering to the following hard coded rule:

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Ignored The Latest Rally
 
As Glassnode lead on-chain analyst Checkmate explained in a post on X, the old BTC hands aren’t even selling at levels similar to 2019 yet. The relevant indicator here is the “Value Days Destroyed Multiple,” which is based on another metric called the “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD).
 
In on-chain analysis, a coin day represents the amount that 1 BTC accumulates after sitting still on the blockchain for 1 day. When a coin that has been dormant for a while finally moves, its coin days counter would naturally reset back to zero, and the coin days it had been carrying earlier would be “destroyed.”
