As noted by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo on X, this week marks the eighth anniversary of Cathie Wood's decision to make Ark Invest the first U.S. exchange-traded fund (ETF) to invest in Bitcoin when its price was a mere $200 to $300 per coin. 
At that time, Bitcoin was still a relatively uncharted territory for traditional investment vehicles like ETFs. However, Wood's decision to include Bitcoin in ARKW's portfolio was groundbreaking and reflected her belief in the potential of the digital currency.
Wood remarked at the time:

This has seen the meme coin’s price fall to levels that have not been recorded since June. Naturally, this has led to skepticism about the cryptocurrency and its ability to perform. However, these recent developments over the last few weeks suggest that investors are still doubling down amid the uncertainty.
 
Massive SHIB Inflows Into Robinhood Wallets
 
Although Robinhood made its fame by allowing the trading of meme stocks such as GameStop and then opening early trading for leading meme coin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu has also become a prominent player on the platform.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-hovers-near-2-week-high-ahead-of-us-retail-sales-report/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-14T12:47:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin neared a two-week high on Thursday, as markets looked ahead to today’s retail sales report in the United States. Sales are expected to rise by 0.2% in August, a drop from a 0.7% increase the month before. Ethereum remained in the green, moving back above a key support point earlier in the day.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin remained in the green for a second consecutive session, ahead of the upcoming U.S. retail sales report. Consumer spending is expected to fall lower, which comes as inflation increased last month.
 
Following a low of $26,084.80 on Wednesday, BTC/USD surged to a peak of $26,529.50 earlier in today’s session.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge comes as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 45.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 49.04, which is marginally below a ceiling at the 53.00 mark.
 
Should it move beyond this, there is a good chance that bitcoin will rise above the $27,000 level in the coming days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) was also in the green on Thursday, as price rose above a recent support point.
 
ETH/USD reached a high of $1,635.82 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,593.11.
 
The move resulted in the world’s second largest cryptocurrency climbing above a key price floor at $1,620.
 
 
Similar to BTC, today’s rally coincided with the RSI moving past a ceiling of its own at the 40.00 mark, and it now sits at 44.00.
 
This latest rebound has increased the possibility of an upward cross, and should this happen, ETH will be trending closer to $1,700.
