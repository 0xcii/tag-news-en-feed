        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/regulation/malaysias-regulator-orders-huobi-to-shut-down-cites-illegal-operation/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-22T15:45:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has ordered cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global to cease operating in the Southeast Asia country, noting that the platform possesses no requisite authorization or registration. The securities regulator also asked the exchange to disable its website and mobile  
application on various platforms such as Apple and Google Play Stores.
SC announced the enforcement action on Tuesday, noting that it also ordered Huobi to stop circulating or publishing any advertisements targeted at Malaysian investors, whether  
through email or social media platforms. The watchdog said it was concerned about the Seychelles-based crypto exchange's compliance with local regulatory requirements and the protection of  
investors' interests. 
According to SC, Huobi's lack of registration as a Recognized Market Operator (RMO) violates the country's capital markets law. As a result, the financial markets supervisor ordered Leon  
Li, Huobi's CEO, to ensure compliance with the directives.
SC Warns Malaysian Investors 
In the announcement, SC also warned Malaysian investors who patronizes Huobi to immediately halt trading on the crypto exchange's platform. It further advised them to withdraw their investments from the platform and shut down their accounts. 
Additionally, the regulator urged investors to engage with only RMOs which it said have undergone "strict regulatory scrutiny" and are required to adhere to strict guidelines to protect investors  
under the country's securities laws.
"Those who invest with unlicensed or unregistered entities or individuals are exposed to risks such as fraud and may not be protected under Malaysian securities laws," SC said in the statement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tron rose for a fourth consecutive session on Monday, pushing the token to an eleven-month high. The move comes despite current sentiment of uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market. Cardano was also higher, snapping a losing streak in the process. 
 
TRON (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) rose close to an eleven-month high to start the week, following a recent four-day bull run.
 
TRX/USD rose to a peak of $0.07841 earlier in the day, which comes a day after trading at a low of $0.07271.
 
As a result of Monday’s move, TRON climbed to its strongest point since June 10 last year.
 
 
One of the catalysts of the surge appears to be a breakout which transpired on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
The index moved beyond the ceiling of 69.00, and as of writing, is tracking at 77.17.
 
Now in overbought territory, there could be some profit taking, however a target of $0.080 still remains a possibility.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Whilst TRX has now risen for a fourth day, cardano (ADA) ended a four-session losing streak on Monday.
 
Following a low of $0.3573 on Sunday, ADA/USD rose by as much as 2% today, hitting a high of $0.3732.
 
Today’s rebound in price came as bulls seemingly rejected a breakout of a floor at the $0.3570 mark.
 
 
This came as the RSI also held firm at a key point of support, with price strength moving away from the 40.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 44.29, with a ceiling at 49.00 a possible target for ADA bulls.
 
If this zone is reached, there is a relatively good chance cardano will be trading above $0.3800.

Possible Risks of Consensus Overload
 
Crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum use the consensus mechanism to validate transaction authenticity and maintain the security of the underlying blockchain.
 
 
This consensus mechanism influences how a blockchain network verifies transactions while determining network fees, transaction speed, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to consolidate on Monday, ahead of U.S. debt ceiling talks with President Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. It is expected that if a deal isn’t reached this week, the government will run out of cash on June 1. Ethereum was marginally higher.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the week in consolidation, as markets remain hopeful of a deal to increase the debt ceiling in the United States.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,549.73, which comes less than 24 hours after a high at $26,986.08.
 
Overall, Monday’s move is the third straight day in which BTC has traded below the $27,000 mark.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that BTC has now found a firm floor at $26,300, with prices hovering slightly above that point.
 
In order for a significant move to take place, a ceiling of 44.00, or support at 39.00, on the relative strength index (RSI), will need to be broken.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.18.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rose slightly higher on Monday, as it once again bounced from a key support point.
 
Following a low of $1,793.22 on Sunday, ETH/USD climbed to a peak of $1,820.25 earlier in the day.
 
The drop saw ethereum near its recent price floor at the $1,790 mark, however bulls used this as a sign to reenter the market.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Still, earlier gains have somewhat dropped, with the index currently tracking close to a ceiling of 46.00.
 
In order for momentum to fully turn bullish, this resistance will need to be broken, which is unlikely to happen until a debt ceiling deal is reached.
