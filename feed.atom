As of writing, not only is BTC firm above $60,000 but has managed to stand above $62,500, a level of interest especially by traders. So far, Bitcoin remains in an uptrend, and upbeat traders are looking at $66,000 and $72,000 in the coming sessions.

Schiff didn’t miss the chance to poke fun at Bitcoin by saying that it had dropped 30% since its record high in 2021. “Gold continues to show its worth as a stable and valuable product, while Bitcoin shines as a speculative bubble,” he said. His views come at a time when the price of Bitcoin is going through big changes, which adds to the fight between traditional assets and digital ones.
