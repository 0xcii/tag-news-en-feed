In response to the ruling, Bitcoin’s value surged by more than 7% to reach $27,852, leading to a broader upswing in the cryptocurrency market and crypto-related stocks.
 
However, the top crypto has since faced challenges in recovering its position, even following a unanimous 3-0 decision in favor of Grayscale vs. the SEC, that seemed to open the path for a US-based exchange-traded fund focused on the cryptocurrency.

the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) still uses the same tactics it
