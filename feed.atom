In a webinar held on Wednesday,  
the regulation shared some details on the regulation, noting that the new rules relate to adverts  
intended to attract crypto investments and released either “as a regular

Now, the country’s central bank is reportedly planning to establish new organizations to mine crypto assets and settle foreign payments, as reported by the local media.
 
Officials at the country’s central bank were cited this week by the state news agency TASS as saying that they were working on experimental legislation that would allow the usage of cryptocurrencies in export-import negotiations.
 
Russia’s trade with the West has been hurt by sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, but connections with China have strengthened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin dropped for a second consecutive session on Thursday, as price moved towards a key point of support. Today’s sell-off has sent the cryptocurrency below $29,000, with the coin now trading at a ten-day low. Ethereum fell to a one-week low in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was once again in the red on Thursday, as traders continued to secure gains from last week’s bull run.
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $28,596.91 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $29,509.35.
 
This is the lowest point that bitcoin has hit since April 10, when price traded at a bottom of around $28,100.
 
 
Looking at the chart, Thursday’s move saw BTC fall under a recent floor at $28,600, with the relative strength index (RSI) also dropping toward a floor of its own.
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 51.47, which is marginally above the aforementioned support at 50.00.
 
BTC has already moved away from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $28,837.95, as of writing.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) slipped to a one-week low in today’s session, as traders attempted to find a point of support.
 
Following a high of $2,005.44 on Wednesday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,928.58 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this drop, ethereum fell to its weakest point since April 13, a day which saw ETH hover marginally above $1,900.
 
 
At the time of writing, ETH has rebounded, which appears to be due to its RSI bouncing from a floor at 52.00.
 
Ethereum is currently trading at $1,945.58, with the index at the 54.54 level, below an upcoming ceiling at 58.00.
 
If bulls were to take price strength to, or above, 58.00, there is a good chance that ETH will be back over the $2,000 level.

This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, a content creator and small business owner who has an Orange Pill App profile.
The team over at Orange Pill App is breaking new ground toward Bitcoin adoption on a peer-to-peer level. But if you don’t know anything about this platform, here is a quick rundown: 
It’s an app available on iOS or Android that helps you find local Bitcoiners in your area. How often have you felt like you are the only Bitcoiner in town? I know I have plenty of time. Wouldn’t it be nice to make new friends that love Bitcoin as much as you do in real life?
