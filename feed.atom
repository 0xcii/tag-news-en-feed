Bitcoin Miner Reserve Has Continued To Head Down Recently
 
As pointed out by analyst Ali in a new post on X, the BTC miners have made some hefty selling moves during the last 10 days. The indicator of interest here is the “miner reserve,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin the miners are carrying in their wallets.
