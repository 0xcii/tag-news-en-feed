        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market experienced a sudden and sharp downturn on Friday, April 12, which saw the Bitcoin price and the value of other large-cap assets take severe hits. The price of Bitcoin, which has been mostly moving sideways over the past few days, fell below the $67,000 mark for the first time in more than a week.
 
As a result of the abrupt decline, the crypto market has witnessed nearly $900 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours. According to Futures market data from Coinglass, losses from leveraged Bitcoin and Ether positions are responsible for the larger chunk of the liquidations.
 
On-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed the driving factor behind the latest decline in the Bitcoin price and the general crypto market downturn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The tide may be turning in the highly watched legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. A recent decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals could significantly weaken the SEC’s case and bolster Ripple’s defense.
 
 
The case in question, SEC v. Govil, involved allegations of fraudulent securities offerings by Aron Govil through his company Cemtrex. The SEC sought disgorgement, a court order requiring the return of improperly obtained funds.
 
However, the Second Circuit ruled that the SEC could not pursue disgorgement unless investors could prove they suffered actual financial losses. This “no harm, no foul” approach throws a wrench into the SEC’s strategy and offers Ripple a potential lifeline.
