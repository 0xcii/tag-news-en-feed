Indonesia, the Financial Services Authority (OJK) has announced that crypto

New Measure to Enhance Crypto Sector Security
Under the new regulatory framework, firms offering crypto

The US Department of Justice submitted 52 victim impact statements to the court, painting a grim picture of lives upended and dreams shattered. A former member of the FTX Unsecured Creditors Committee detailed the loss of his entire $4 million life savings, forcing him out of work and into a deep depression.
