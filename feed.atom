        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In November 2023, six unique AI-driven chatbots were queried to forecast the value of bitcoin by year-end, with their projections spanning from $15,000 to $45,000 per bitcoin. As of the initial week of January 2024, bitcoin’s trading value reached $47,000, coinciding with the approval of 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. With the bitcoin halving event on the horizon, we revisited these chatbots to gather their predictions for bitcoin’s price at the close of the year.
 
The January Prediction: 6 AI Chatbots See Bitcoin at $60K-$90K by the End of 2024

        <updated>2024-01-12T16:03:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genesis Global Trading has agreed to a settlement  
with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The company, known  
for its crypto operations, will pay a fine of $8 million, relinquish its  
BitLicense obtained since 2018, and cease all operations in New York.
This move followed an investigation by New York  
authorities, exposing flaws in Genesis' Anti-Money Laundering and cybersecurity  
protocols, rendering the firm susceptible to illicit activities. 
The New York State Department of Financial Services  
(DFS) Superintendent Adrienne Harris mentioned: "DFS's virtual currency  
and cybersecurity regulations are often cited as the gold standard, providing  
clear and stringent requirements to protect consumers and safeguard institutions  
from bad actors." 
Genesis Global Trading Faces Regulatory Scrutiny
"Genesis Global Trading's failure to maintain a  
functional compliance program demonstrated a disregard for the Department's  
regulatory requirements and exposed the company and its customers to potential  
threats."
The DFS' investigation pointed to flaws in crucial  
areas such as the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering compliance,  
transaction monitoring, Suspicious Activity Report filings, Office of Foreign  
Assets Control (OFAC) screening, and cybersecurity.
Licensed in 2018, Genesis Global Trading operated  
under the purview of the NYDFS. However, this settlement necessitates that  
Genesis surrender its BitLicense.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a notable statement, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has expressed a positive perspective on Bitcoin during an interview today with CNBC, affirming that it "is an asset that protects you." 



"I believe it goes up if the world is frightened, if the people have fearful geopolitical risks, they're fearful of their own risks," said Fink. "It's no different than what gold represented over thousands of years. It is an asset class that protects you."
Fink's recognition of Bitcoin as a protective asset suggests helps shift the narrative surrounding the digital currency, emphasizing its role as a safeguard amid economic uncertainties. This endorsement from the head of the world's largest asset management firm is a significant milestone for Bitcoin's acceptance within mainstream financial circles.
"Unlike gold where we manufacture new gold, we're almost at the ceiling of the amount of Bitcoin that can be created," Fink continued. "What we're trying to do is offer an instrument that can store wealth."
The statement comes just two days after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved BlackRock's, alongside 10 other asset managers, spot Bitcoin ETF. Fink's positive sentiment further adds to the growing chorus of influential figures recognizing Bitcoin's potential to play a protective role in an investment portfolio.
As the Bitcoin market continues to evolve, statements like these from key industry figures contribute to shaping a positive narrative around Bitcoin, potentially influencing broader market sentiments and paving the way for increased adoption.]]></summary>

This regulatory clarity and institutional adoption will likely catalyse the next major Crypto bull market.
 
Unleashing a wave of new demand
 
These new spot Bitcoin ETFs remove key obstacles for mainstream investment in digital assets. No longer do investors need to directly hold or custody Bitcoin to gain price exposure.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has intensified its scrutiny of the cryptocurrency firm Ripple Labs, Inc.

This followed yesterday’s quick surge to the $49K level, which then declined in the early trading hours of Thursday. Although there was a transient increase to the $47K mark, the value has stayed under the $46K threshold since that point. Notably, there has been minimal market movement and volume recorded at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday morning.

This debut was far from ordinary. With nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs launching simultaneously, analysts were left scrambling for comparisons. “Trading volumes have been relatively strong for new ETF products,” admitted Todd Rosenbluth, strategist at VettaFi, “but this is a longer race than just a single day’s trading.”

exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission

This decision, detailed in a press release yesterday

The FSC's stance centers around the potential  
contradiction between domestic securities firms brokering overseas-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs and the South Korean government's position on virtual assets.
