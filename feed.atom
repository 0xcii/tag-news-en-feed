Arizona Lawmaker Wants to Make Bitcoin Legal Tender
 
Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers has introduced several crypto-related bills, including one to make bitcoin legal tender in her state.
 
“Launched my crypto bills today,” Rogers tweeted Tuesday. The bills are co-sponsored by her state senate Republican colleagues Jeff Weninger and J.D. Mesnard.
 
One of the bills proposes making bitcoin legal tender. The legislation defines the cryptocurrency as “the decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency in which a record of transactions is maintained on the bitcoin blockchain and new units of currency are generated by the computational solution of mathematical problems and that operates independently of a central bank.”
 
Another bill proposes allowing state agencies to enter “into an agreement with a cryptocurrency issuer to provide a method to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method of fines, civil penalties or other penalties, rent, rates, taxes, fees, charges, revenue, financial obligations, and special assessments to pay any amount due to that agency or this state.”
 
 
 
Rogers introduced a similar bill to make bitcoin legal tender in Arizona last year but it was quickly shot down. She tweeted last April:
 

Centralized digital money controlled by the central bankers is slavery. Decentralized bitcoin is freedom.
 
In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. Since then, the country, led by the pro-bitcoin president Nayib Bukele, has purchased thousands of BTC for its treasury. Last November, Bukele announced that El Salvador is buying bitcoin every day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A 90-day trial period kicks off Clover’s integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network, enabling faster, cheaper payments at merchants.
Strike CEO Jack Mallers has taken to Twitter to announce that Strike is now an integrated partner with payments giant Fiserv, parent company of Clover. Subsequently, Strike has launched a pilot integration with Clover allowing merchants to accept bitcoin over the Lightning Network.



According to his announcement, the integration is not limited to Strike. Instead, merchants will be able to accept Lightning payments from any source — “From Cash App to a node over Tor. If it can make a Lightning payment, you can use it,” Mallers stated on Twitter.
Mallers clarified that this rollout is part of a 90-day trial period, which will involve measuring the speed and cost of facilitating transactions using the new integration. In addition to that, the amount of business that integrating Lightning brings to merchants will be closely monitored. 
After the pilot, Strike aims to enter the Clover app store, and afterwards, direct integration into Clover. This would enable Lightning by default for all Clover merchants, putting it right next to card networks like Visa and MasterCard. 
“Ultimately, these payment giants want to see Lightning in action,” Mallers said on Twitter. “They want to feel it, touch it, and see people use it. An open, instant, cheap, inclusive, and innovative payment network seems too good to be true. Time to show Lightning is the world's superior payments rail.”
The trial period is now active and Clover merchants can reach out to Strike in order to enable cheaper, faster payments using the Bitcoin Lightning Network.]]></summary>

It has already penetrated the payments sector with multiple crypto payment processors already accepting SHIB, as well as the food industry with the Welly’s SHIB-themed fast food restaurant. This time around, the meme coin is making its way into the fashion industry.
 
Shiba Inu Themed Clothing Collection
 
An Italian fashion designer named John Richmond has taken to Twitter to reveal his latest collection. In the tweet, Richmond shows a street-style design that had the word Shiba written on the shirt as well as the pants. The varsity jacket had the designer’s initials J.R. written on them.

The S&P 500 is at the most-watched trend line in global markets and the outcome could ultimately give BTC a major boost.  Here’s why. 
 
How The S&P 500 Could Give Bitcoin A Boost
 
For nearly the last 100 years, the S&P 500 has been the most prominent stock market index, tracking the performance of 500 of the largest US companies. It is the benchmark used to compare the performance of individual stocks. 
 
Since the start of the pandemic Bitcoin and the S&P 500 become highly correlated, but that correlation has since dissipated. BTC has instead become more correlated to gold.
