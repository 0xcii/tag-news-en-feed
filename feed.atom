        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price has seen a massive downside this week going into the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. The digital asset’s price saw a sharp 8% drawdown, which sent its price below $57,000, its lowest point in two months. While this came as a surprise to many, one crypto analyst in particular was able to pinpoint this crash, and their analyst shows where the Bitcoin price might be headed next.
 
Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash
 
Crypto analyst RLinda has been one of the few analysts who accurately predicted this Bitcoin price crash. In an April 27 post on the TradingView website, when the BTC price was still trending above $63,000, the analyst had predicted that the price was headed for a crash.

Bitcoin Has Seen Bears Winning As Price Has Plunged 6% Over The Past Day
 
Recently, Bitcoin has been stuck in consolidation in the $60,000 to $70,000 price range, unable to mount any sustained move in either direction. During the past day, however, the coin has seen a significant move away from this range, and it’s not in the direction the bulls would have wanted.
 
 
The below chart shows what the price action of the cryptocurrency has looked like recently.
 

 
 
During this latest plunge, BTC briefly slipped to a low under $57,000 before seeing a small rebound to the current $57,500 mark. This is the lowest that the asset has been since late February.
