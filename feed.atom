notable movement in Bitcoin reserves between Binance and Coinbase. The report revealed a decrease of 5,000 BTC in Binance's reserves and an

Analysts have attributed this trend to retail outflows

Trying to contrast the world’s first successful digitally native currency to a single industry is narrow minded, let alone a single company. However, as I continuously surrender to the process of meeting people where they are on their bitcoin journey, I realized I can use this comparison to illustrate Bitcoin’s strengths in a different way. 
Rather than trying to conceptually pull Bitcoin up to the level of global currencies, I suggest conceptually pulling global currencies down to the level of publicly traded companies. This temporarily negates the necessity of delving into the history of monetary theory when trying to explain Bitcoin.

This blunder occurred in block 818,087, mined by Antpool, marking the highest fee ever recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
Bitcoin Transaction Gone Wrong: User Forks Out Over 83 Bitcoin in Fees
 
Block 818,087 stands out in Bitcoin’s ledger for recording the largest fee for a single transaction in its history. This block encapsulated around 4,179 transactions. Besides the standard reward of 6.25 newly created BTC, Antpool earned an additional 85.216 BTC in fees from this block.
 
The extraordinary transaction fee amounted to 83.65 BTC, transferring 55.77 BTC, valued at approximately $2 million based on current exchange rates. This incident surpasses the previous record, where an excessive fee of about 19.8 BTC – worth $738,639 today but approximately $500K at that time – was paid.
 
 
This earlier record was set in block 807,057, mined by F2pool, which earned 20.0127 BTC in total fees from the block. The 19.8 BTC transfer was later identified as a transaction by Paxos. In a gesture of goodwill, F2pool chose to refund the company, demonstrating that miners have the discretion to reimburse addresses in cases of apparent errors.
