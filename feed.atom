        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, the Bitcoin community has been abuzz with discussions about the network’s scaling challenges. As the blockchain’s transfer fees continue to surge, the backlog of transactions stuck in the mempool has hit an unprecedented high. Crypto enthusiasts have been sharing their diverse perspectives on the matter, leading to a flurry of takes across various social media platforms.
 
Bitcoin’s Scaling Challenges Spark Controversy and Diverse Perspectives
 
The recent surge in Ordinals and BRC20 token usage has led to a significant increase in onchain activity, causing the mempool to overflow with over 400,000 transactions. Currently, a whopping 194 blocks need to be mined to clear the backlog, which would take more than 24 hours at an average of ten minutes per block. As a result, people h…]]></summary>

While supporters argue that BRC20 tokens are a groundbreaking innovation from which the network will benefit in the long run due to rising transaction fees to finance miners, critics see a DDoS attack as the mempool is flooded with low-value transactions, effectively to speculate with sh*tcoins.
 
Is Bitcoin Under Attack?
 
The latter party includes John W. Ratcliff, a renowned video game programmer and Bitcoin OG. Ratcliff wrote today via Twitter that based on the way BRC20 tokens are coded, it is clearly an attack on Bitcoin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Web3 bug bounty platform Immunefi launched two years ago, CEO and founder Mitchell Amador says the bug bounties weren't great and adoption was slow.

"There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>

That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>
