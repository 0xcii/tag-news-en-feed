Moreover, the number of PYUSD holders has risen by 55% since September 30, 2023. Concentration, however, is still evident in PYUSD, with the top 100 holders owning 99.95% of its current supply.
 
Paypal Stablecoin Witnesses Redistribution Among Top Holders
 
Paypal’s stablecoin ecosystem experienced growth in October. The number of unique addresses and transfers has risen, and more PYUSD has been issued. On September 30, 2023, 924 unique wallets held PYUSD. Today, that number stands at 1,438 holders. Additionally, PYUSD had only 180 transfers 25 days ago, but that count has now reached a total of 8,307 transactions. Still…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto exchange Binance briefly halted withdrawals on its platform after experiencing a technical issue. The company launched an investigation, and an hour later, withdrawal resumed on the platform.
 
 
 
Binance Experiences Technical Issues
 
According to a post on social media platform X, withdrawals were paused due to an issue with the middleware service running on the platform. While crypto withdrawals were halted, users had access to fiat withdrawals.
 
Following an investigation that failed to provide details about the specifics of the issue, the crypto exchange restored the service. The company stated:
 

The issue is now fixed, and all crypto withdrawals on Binance are now back to functioning as usual. Thanks for your patience, and we apologize for the inconvenience.
 
In the crypto community, some took to X to promote their platforms over the centralized exchange. In particular, the team behind decentralized exchange (DEX) THORChain took the opportunity to remind users about their alleged advantages over Binance:
 

All cross-chain services deal with many, many issues and have to pause to deal with edge cases. The difference with TC is that you can jump in and see exactly what’s wrong at any time and don’t need a spokesperson so say “funds are safe” – because you can check it yourself.
 
Binance has experienced several obstacles lately, from the increasing regulatory oversight in major jurisdictions, such as the US and Europe, and key members leaving their positions. In addition, the exchanges are currently fighting many legal battles while their trading volumes crashed in some regions.
 
 
Still, the crypto company claims to be committed to continue offering its services to its millions of users. On the latest issue, the exchange’s CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, stated:
 

Technical issue with a middleware service impacting withdrawals. Funds are SAFU. Our team is on it.

Bitcoin was launched in 2009, and has surged in price towards blow-off tops, and subsequent crashes, multiple times. On each occasion, there were several factors at work, but key narratives can be identified.
 Back in 2013, we had very early, tech-savvy adopters picking up on what was envisioned as a new currency. In 2017, retail traders became caught up in the exuberance, and there was a sense that Bitcoin might be a kind of digital gold. And most recently, in 2021, we had the promise of institutional participation.
 In fact, as we progress, the narratives start to operate alongside one another. The Lightning Network, a Layer 2 payment protocol for Bit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin profit takers swooped in to capture recent profits on Wednesday, as the cryptocurrency retreated below a recent high above $35,000. The decline comes ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech later today. Ethereum also edged lower, dropping under the $1,800 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was trading lower on Wednesday, as traders appeared to have finally decided to secure profits, following recent gains.
 
BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $33,278.40 late in yesterday’s session, after an earlier peak above the $35,000 mark.
 
Although bulls have since pushed the cryptocurrency higher, with the price now at $34,246.74, it remains below heights seen on Tuesday.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
One reason for this being the relative strength index (RSI), which was significantly overbought on Tuesday, tracking around 89.00.
 
Currently, the index is at a reading of 87.22, which is marginally lower, but still remains primed for a reversal.
 
Today’s speech could be the storm that traders are waiting to clear, before either intensifying recent momentum, or selling off further.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) retreated below the $1,800 level on Wednesday, snapping a six-day winning streak.
 
Following a high of $1,852.68 during yesterday’s session, ETH/USD fell to a low of $1,758.69 earlier in the day.
 
ETH has since rebounded, marginally, and is now trading at $1,784.57, which is over 3% lower than Tuesday’s peak.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Overall sentiment remains largely positive, with the 10-day (red) moving average extending its upward trend versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Although the RSI in ethereum is also overbought, and tracking above 70.00, bulls could attempt to push the price above $1,900 in this upcycle.
