This amendment involves a crucial adjustment regarding the classification of ten cryptocurrencies, including Solana and Cardano, which were initially labeled as securities in the SEC’s comprehensive legal action against Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao.
 
Cardano, Solana Are Not Securities
 
The original complaint, lodged on June 5, 2023, by the SEC, targeted Binance along with its US affiliate, BAM Trading Services Inc. The agency’s charges centered on allegations that these entities operated without the necessary registrations for functioning as national securities exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing …]]></summary>

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Lummis said the bill would have the U.S. Treasury purchase Bitcoin over a 5-year period as a strategic reserve asset to fortify the dollar. She likened it to the government's strategic petroleum reserve.
"We know from modelling the numbers and past experience with Bitcoin that it is capable of being an absolute game changer for the mess the United States has gotten itself into with its debt and its deficits," says Lummis.
The senator said the government would self-custody the Bitcoin across various geographic locations. The assets could only be…]]></summary>
