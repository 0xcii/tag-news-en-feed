Ethereum Addresses With At Least 1 Million ETH Now Hold 32.3% Of Supply
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the Ethereum whales with more than 1 million ETH have grown their holdings recently. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which keeps track of the percentage of the Ethereum supply that each investor group is holding currently.
 
The holders or addresses are divided into these groups based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balances. The 100-1,000 coins cohort, for instance, includes all investors who own at least 100 and at most 1,000 ETH.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin stalled in today’s session, as traders consolidated gains, following a recent two-month high. The global market cap is trading 0.01% lower as of writing, with the cryptocurrency remaining above the $28,000 level. Ethereum has been marginally higher, and continues to hover around the $1,580 region.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin bulls consolidated recent gains on Wednesday, as traders appeared to be capturing profits following recent highs.
 
BTC/USD edged to a low of $28,172.91 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after a high of $28,889.01.
 
Today’s price consolidation comes after the world’s largest cryptocurrency rose to as high as $30,000 earlier in the week.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Looking at the chart, the decline comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) maintains its position marginally above a floor at the 62.00 level.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 62.28, after a failed breakout from a resistance of 65.00 on Monday.
 
Price may continue to consolidate until either the aforementioned floor or ceiling is broken.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) made slight gains on hump-day, as it continued to hover around the $1,580 mark.
 
Following a low of $1,554.40 on Tuesday, ETH/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $1,584.73 during the day.
 
Earlier gains have since eased, with ethereum now trading at $1,577.40, with short-term bulls still targeting the $1,600 zone.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This may be difficult to achieve as momentum appears to be bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average continuing to trend downwards.
 
Whilst at a reading of 45.75, a ceiling awaits ETH’s price strength at the 49.00 zone, and should it move beyond this, there will likely be an influx of bulls.
