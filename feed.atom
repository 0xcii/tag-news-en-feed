Prominent lawyer and XRP supporter John E. Deaton recently contributed his two cents, noting how a settlement would be the best case for Ripple. According to the attorney, it is a 99.9% victory if Ripple ends up paying $20 million or less in settlement.

The legal tussle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and payment giant Ripple has dragged on for quite a while. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs in 2020, alleging that Ripple’s XRP token is an unregistered security.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ofac-sanctions-russian-national-accused-of-using-virtual-currency-to-launder-money/"/>
        <updated>2023-11-05T11:43:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Russian national Ekaterina Zhdanova has been sanctioned as punishment for using virtual currency to launder money for designated Russian elites. OFAC said Zhdanova’s properties and interests in the United States are now either blocked or must be reported.
 
Russian Elites Seeking to Evade U.S. Sanctions
 
The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s OFAC announced on Nov. 3 that it had sanctioned a Russian national it accuses of using virtual currency to launder money for Russian elites. According to OFAC, the action is in line with the Group of Seven Countries (G7)’s goal of going after sanction busters who have been helping sanctioned Russian oligarchs.
 
As per the statement, the Russian national, Ekaterina Zhdanova (Zhdanova), is accused of helping an unnamed client obfuscate the source of $2.3 million that was funneled into Western Europe. By taking such a step, Zhdanova helped the sanctioned Russian individual evade the sanctions, OFAC added.
 
the_ad_placement id=”article-middle-content”]
 
Commenting on Zhdanova’s addition to the list of sanctioned Russian nationals, Brian E. Nelson, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said:
 

We remain focused on safeguarding the U.S. and international financial system against those who seek to exploit this technology, among other illicit finance risks in the virtual assets ecosystem.
 
As a result of her designation, OFAC said Zhdanova’s properties and interests in the United States are either blocked or must be reported. According to OFAC, Zhdanova’s activities undermine the effectiveness of multilateral U.S. and international sanctions which are intended to “impose costs on Russia for its unprovoked war.”

This process culminated in 1971 when the Federal Exchange could no longer exchange US dollars for gold. In 1976, the gold standard was abandoned entirely, and gold became a free asset.
