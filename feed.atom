Bitcoin Difficulty Regression Model Puts Cost Of Production At $22,900 Per BTC
 
In a new tweet, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has looked into the current profitability of the BTC miners. Naturally, to estimate the profits that these chain validators might be making, the cost of production that they incur needs to be known first.
 
To find this cost, the analytics firm has used its “difficulty regression model.” According to Glassnode, the model “is an estimated all-in-sustaining cost of production for Bitcoin (for the average miner).”
 
As its name may already imply, the model is based on the “mining difficulty” metric. The difficulty is a feature on the BTC…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Kevin Melody, a node runner and real estate professional.
An “over-unity” power generator (similar to the concept of a perpetual-motion machine) is a hypothetical device that produces more energy than is required to run it. Although there is quite a bit of controversy in this field, the mainstream scientific consensus is that over-unity power generation is impossible, because it defies the first law of thermodynamics. 
According to this law, energy can undergo transformations from one form to another, but the total amount of energy within a closed system remains constant. This principle is derived from empirical observations and has been validated through numerous experiments and theoretical frameworks. 
In practical terms, this means that energy can neither…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin dropped below the $30,000 level on Friday, ahead of the upcoming nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report in the United States. Today’s report comes as private sector jobs rose by 497,000 in the last report, double the expected number. Friday’s NFP is projected to come in at 225,000. Ethereum hit a one-week low today. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to a one-week low on Friday, ahead of the upcoming nonfarm payrolls report in the United States.
 
Payrolls are expected to come in at 225,000 for June, less than the 339,000 jobs added the month prior.
 
Many believe a strong number will almost certainly guarantee that the Federal Reserve will hike rates later this month.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 

 
BTC/USD dropped to a low at $29,777.28 earlier in the session, which is its lowest point since last Friday, when price fell to $29,417.
 
Today’s sell-off came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) plunged to a floor at the 55.00 mark.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has shifted course, and now looks to be downward facing.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also plunged in today’s session, dropping below the $1,900 mark for the first time since the end of June.
 
Following a high at $1,917.61 on Thursday, ETH/USD fell to an intraday low of $1,832.03 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the lowest point ETH has hit since June 30, when the price collided with a support point at $1,820.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
ETH has since rebounded from today’s earlier low, and is currently trading at $1,862.52, as bulls have seemingly bought the dip.
 
This comes as the RSI found a floor of its own at 47.00, and has gone on to reach a present point of 49.86.
 
The next visible resistance level looks as though it is at 53.00, and if it hits that point, it is likely ethereum will be near $1,890.

Caught in the crosshairs of this unconventional quest is Sarawak Energy, a prominent state-owned electric company in Malaysia, which has now set its sights on exposing these unscrupulous cryptocurrency miners accused of brazenly pilfering electricity to fuel their mining rigs. 
 
While the specific cryptocurrency being mined remains undisclosed, it is worth noting that Bitcoin (BTC) continues to reign supreme among mining operations, particularly after Ethereum made the momentous shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism last year.
