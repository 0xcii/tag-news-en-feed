At that time, among those being considered by the company to make ends meet were selling some of its assets and securing equipment financing to buff its thinning balance sheet and improve its liquidity.

According to the latest update shared by the team managing the decentralized finance venture, the still-to-be-identified cybercriminal responsible for the hack seemed to have had a change of heart and returned all the funds he siphoned off during the breach.
 
 
As a means of confirmation for the bizarre turn of events, Defrost Finance showed to the public the wallet address that now contains the returned assets which include $3 million worth of ETH tokens and 9.9 million DAI.

This is an opinion editorial by Shinobi, a self-taught educator in the Bitcoin space and tech-oriented Bitcoin podcast host.
Channel jamming is one of the most threatening outstanding problems with the Lightning Network. It presents an open mechanism to denial-of-service attack nodes on the network to prevent them from routing, losing them money while their liquidity is locked up and unable to forward payments that will earn them fees. An attacker can route a payment through other nodes from themselves to themselves, and refuse to finalize the payment. This makes that liquidity useless for forwarding other payments until the hashed timelock contract (HTLC) timeloc…]]></summary>

As Bitcoinist reported last week, SBF was granted a $250 million bail. When his family posted their house as collateral, the former FTX was allowed to await trial under house arrest. The FTX founder was allegedly involved in a scheme that cost his clients over $8 billion in losses.
