        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elon Musk, the tech magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla, has raised questions about Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s apparent retreat from X, the platform Musk acquired in 2022 for $44 billion. The conversation was sparked by a post from “Autism Capital,” a crypto influencer with significant clout in the crypto dialogue, who lamented Buterin’s reduced engagement on X, advocating for its potential to significantly uplift Ethereum’s presence.
 
Why Is The Ethereum Founder Avoiding X?
 
“Vitalik needs to get back on X. Farcaster isn’t going to win the culture war. If he wants Ethereum to shine he should engage more on this platform, not sequester himself with his chosen peers on an island. He will have far more impact if he engages the bigger community here,” Autism Capital stated.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Sold Big In Past 30 Days
 
As explained by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the Bitcoin network has observed multiple transactions involving a large amount of dormant coins.

This is a question that I have thought about recently, and I wanted to think through what happens to governments on a Bitcoin standard.

 In fact, the new ETFs have been unprecedented in their levels of attention and initial demand over their first two months, and are leading to an urgent need for deeper analysis of bitcoin and crypto among traditional financial firms.
 The global trading and investment firm Exante, providing access to markets encompassing shares, ETFs, currencies, metals, and bonds across more than twenty locations, exemplifies this trend.
