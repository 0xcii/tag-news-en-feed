Stablecoins Are Observing Higher Than Usual Inflows Right Now
 
As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the monthly average exchange inflow of the top two stablecoins, USDT and USDC, has gone up recently.
 
The “exchange inflow” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset being deposited into the wallets associated with centralized exchanges.
 
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means the exchanges are receiving a large amount of deposits right now. Such a trend suggests there is demand among the holders to trade away cryptocurrency.

previous dismissal of a class-action lawsuit against Binance.US. The lawsuit  
accuses the cryptocurrency exchange of unlawfully manipulating the price of the  
HEX token.
A panel of three judges from the Ninth Circuit ruled on  
August 12 that the plaintiff, Ryan Cox, had presented valid claims against  
Binance.US and CoinMarketCap. The panel disagreed with a district court’s  
earlier dismissal, which had found that Cox failed to establish a sufficient  
connection between specific actions in Arizona and Binance.US.
Appeals Court Upholds Claims
Cox initially filed the class-action lawsuit in 2021. He
