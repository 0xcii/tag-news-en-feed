        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The price of PEPE fell drastically on Saturday to reverse some of its gains earlier in the week. Specifically, this price decline saw PEPE fall to $0.00001088, representing a 7.5% decline in 24 hours. While PEPE’s price problems are part of the broader market downturn, recent whale movement seems to have exacerbated the situation.
 
 
Specifically, a crypto whale recently dumped a massive amount of PEPE tokens for ETH. On-chain data shows a single wallet swapped over 1.4 trillion PEPE tokens for ETH, contributing to downward pressure on price.
 
Anticipation Building For ETH Spot ETF Approvals
 
According to on-chain data from TheDataNerd, a notable PEPE whale, known by the address “0x837,” made a strategic shift by converting over $18 million from PEPE to Ethereum over the weekend. Such a…]]></summary>

As a result, these vital network participants are being forced to offload their BTC holdings to offset the increasing operational costs.
