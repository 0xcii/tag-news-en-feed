        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu burns have become a staple in the industry after the community sponsored burning began around two years ago. Every month, community members have been sending millions to billions of SHIB tokens to the burn address in a bid to reduce the total supply. The month of August 2024 has been no different as the aggregate number of tokens burned for the month shows that a notable amount of Shiba Inu coins were also burned for the month.
 
Over 680 Million Shiba Inu Tokens Burned
 
Shibburn, the official website for tracking the total number of Shiba Inu tokens burned each day, released its monthly report that shows the total number of tokens that were sent to the burn address. The month was closed out on a high note, marking a significant jump from the previous month’s figures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin network hash rate reached a new all-time high on September 3rd, surpassing 740 exahashes per second (EH/s). This comes even as Bitcoin prices trade below $60,000.

JUST IN: #Bitcoin's hash rate hit a new ALL TIME HIGH 🚀 pic.twitter.com/BiLY3pRRIV
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 3, 2024
  
  
  
A higher hash rate reflects more computational resources spent processing transactions and mining new Bitcoin. This is despite Bitcoin sliding over 10% this week, which highlights the disconnect between network fundamentals and short-term pricing.
Leading mining companies such as Whatsminer and MicroBT are launching advanced machines to take advantage of the surge in hash rate. Whatsminer has introduced four new mining rigs and a forthcoming solar-powered mining container system. Meanwhile, MicroBT has rolled out its M6XS+ miners, capable of processing between 190 and 450 terahash.
Riot Platforms also purchased Block Mining for $92.5 million to enhance its hash rate and broaden its market presence. Additionally, miners are looking into AI integration and potential acquisition opportunities to address persistent identity challenges in the industry.
Bitcoin's rising hash rate indicates strong confidence in its long-term sustainability. With significant advancements in mining technology and supportive political conditions enhancing profits, miners are rapidly expanding their infrastructure to handle transactions and secure the Bitcoin network.
While the hash rate doesn't directly influence Bitcoin's price, it reinforces the underlying network security. Hashrate milestones also tend to precede bullish market moves and Bitcoin's halving events.]]></summary>

Five justices have rendered their judgment unanimously in relation to Musk refusing to comply with laws in the land – more specifically, the need to appoint a legal representative in Brazil.
 
This ban does not only affect Musk’s operations but also most seriously calls into question free speech and the roles of foreign entities in local jurisdictions.
