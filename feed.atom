Solana Rises To As High As $136
 
Data from CoinMarketCap shows that SOL rose to as high as $136 and almost hit $137 in its latest move to the upside. This rally from the crypto token comes following a New York Times report that Bankman-Fried was offering investment advice to the prison guards and explicitly asked them to invest in SOL.

While many crypto analysts foresee Bitcoin’s dramatic rise to new all-time following the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event, JP Morgan analysts have remained bearish.
