Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Price Performance
 
Taking the year 2024 into account, it seems that Shiba Inu is finally winning the top meme coin battle against Dogecoin. A comparison of prices at the start of the year and now shows that Dogecoin has performed poorly compared to Shiba Inu.
 
 
To put this in perspective, the Shiba Inu price started out the year around $0.000009 and then surged more than 400% in March to $0.000044. The price has since retraced since this and returned to the $0.0…]]></summary>
