        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In its ambition to be a global crypto asset hub, the UK faces significant  
obstacles that threaten to impede progress in the crypto space. The dual  
challenge involves hurdles related to retail customer access to crypto products  
and the complexities surrounding companies attempting to open and maintain  
banking accounts within the UK.

Retail customers' ability to access crypto products faces a critical  
challenge and a driver behind this seems to be the stringent app reporting  
requirements imposed by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR). While these  
measures enhance risk management, they inadvertently deny potential customers  
access to essential financial services, creating a roadblock for crypto  
businesses.
