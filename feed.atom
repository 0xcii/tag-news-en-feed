        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin and crypto market experienced notable price gains last week, fueled by positive developments in the Ripple lawsuit and declining US consumer (CPI) and producer (PPI) prices. Ripple’s favorable court ruling propelled altcoins like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) to double-digit gains.
 
Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, briefly reached a new yearly high at $31,840, although it was unable to sustain the bullish breakout. Despite encouraging US economic data, profit-taking prevailed during the last trading day of the week. As the market enters a new week, the focus shifts to the US Dollar Index (DXY) and its potential impact on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market.
 
The DXY Is In The Spotlight

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency-related crime is down significantly this year, according to data by Chainalysis. Specifically, the blockchain analytics firm explained that crypto inflows to known illicit entities are down 65% compared to the previous year while inflows to risky entities are down 42%.
 
Crypto Crime Down ‘Significantly’ This Year
 
Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis released its mid-year update on cryptocurrency-related crime on Wednesday. Noting that crypto crime is down 65% overall, the firm wrote:
 

Our data shows that cryptocurrency-related crime is down significantly this year.
 
“Through the end of June, crypto inflows to known illicit entities — not including inflows to entities that have been sanctioned or subject to special measures — are down 65% compared to where they were at the same time in 2022,” Chainalysis detailed.
 
In addition, “Inflows to risky entities (made up primarily of mixers and high-risk exchanges) are down 42%” and “Inflows to illicit addresses are down in nearly every category,” the firm noted.
 
While crypto crime is down substantially overall, the blockchain analytics firm pointed out that ransomware was the sole type of cryptocurrency-related crime projected to grow in 2023, as attackers have extorted an additional $175.8 million more than they did during the same time period last year.
 
 
Moreover, crypto scammers have experienced a significant drop in revenue compared to the previous year, with their total collections in 2023 through June being approximately $3.3 billion less than in 2022. Noting that their total earnings for the current year amounted to slightly over $1 billion, Chainalysis emphasized:
 

Through the end of June, crypto scammers have pulled in 77% less revenue than they did through June of 2022 — and keep in mind as well that 2022 itself saw a large drop in revenue compared to 2021.
 
What do you think about the report by Chainalysis that crypto crime is down significantly this year? Let us know in the comments section below.]]></summary>
