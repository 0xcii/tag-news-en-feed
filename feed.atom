        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After climbing by over 20% on Friday, litecoin extended gains to start the weekend, surging to its highest point in over a year. The move comes as momentum surrounding the token’s listing on EDX markets continues to grow. Dogecoin also recorded a strong start to the day.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 

 
Litecoin (LTC) was once again a big mover in cryptocurrency markets, as the token rallied to a multi-month high.
 

 
Following a low of $91.73 during Friday’s session, LTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $111.76 earlier today.
 

 
As a result of the rally, litecoin peaked at its strongest point since April 7 last year, when price reached a top at $116.00.
 

 

 

 
After breaking out of a ceiling at 61.00 on the relative strength index (RSI), LTC bulls took the index past yet another ceiling.
 

 
This time at the 68.00 level, with price strength peaking at 73.91 to start the weekend, which is its highest point since January.
 

 
Litecoin has since gone on to retreat from today’s high, and as of writing, is trading at $110.17.
 

 

 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 

 
Another notable gainer on Saturday was dogecoin (DOGE), which climbed to a three-week high to start the weekend.
 

 
DOGE/USD jumped to a peak of $0.07079 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after falling to $0.06264.
 

 
The move saw the world’s largest meme coin jump nearly 5% higher, hitting its highest level since June 10 in the process.
 

 

 

 
As can be seen from the chart, Saturday’s surge saw dogecoin collide with a key resistance level at $0.07000, before dropping lower.
 

 
DOGE is now trading at $0.06835, with the RSI hovering around the 56.00 mark, which is marginally above a ceiling at 55.00.
 

 
A target of $0.0750 likely remains on the agenda for bulls, however they face some challenges this weekend in order to reach this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum entered the month of July in the green, as price traded at a two-month high to start the weekend. Markets moved to rebound on Saturday, after better than expected consumer sentiment data in the United Stated spooked traders. Bitcoin also rebounded, after falling below $30,000 on Friday.
 
Bitcoin
 

 
After falling below the $30,000 level during Friday’s session, bitcoin (BTC) rebounded on Saturday, however sentiment was still somewhat bearish.
 

 
Following a high of $31,093.98 on Friday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low at $29,600.28 as the session progressed.
 

 
However, the price is now trading at $30,444.75, as bulls moved to buy the dip, pushing BTC higher to start the weekend.
 

 

 

 
As per the chart, the rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) found a floor at the 63.00 mark.
 

 
The index is now tracking at 65.64, and seems to be heading for a resistance point around the 70.00 level.
 

 
A collision with this target will likely result in bitcoin once again moving above $31,000.
 

 

 
Ethereum
 

 
On the other hand, ethereum (ETH) was largely bullish to start the weekend, with price surging to a two-month high.
 

 
ETH/USD has peaked at $1,945.27 so far on Saturday, which comes a day after falling to a low at $1,831.28.
 

 
As a result of this rally, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency jumped to its strongest point since May 6.
 

 

 

 
One of the reasons for this move was a breakout, which saw the RSI move past a ceiling at the 58.00 point.
 

 
As of writing, it appears that this break may have been false, and the index is now at a reading of 58.17, giving up earlier gains.
 

 
ETH is now trading at $1,914.81.
