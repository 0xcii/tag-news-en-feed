The fiery exchange centered on Bitcoin’s potential role in de-dollarization, a trend where countries reduce reliance on the greenback for international transactions.
 
 
Clinton On The Offensive
 
The former Secretary of State fired the first shot, warning that Bitcoin’s rise could “undermine the Dollar as a reserve currency,” citing its influence on de-dollarization efforts like those by the BRICS Group.

Analysis of the crypto’s trend indicates the formation of lower highs since reaching $0.00001195 on December 17th, exasperated by a period of consolidation within the entire crypto market. 
 
However, the current inflow across various cryptocurrencies seems to have flowed into SHIB, pushing the crypto into a breakout over the top of its 2-month downtrend. Consequently, technical analysis and previous performance suggests a continued surge between 50% and 70% for the next few months.
