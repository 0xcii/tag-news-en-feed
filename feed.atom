The move comes as Semler embraces a strategy of adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. In May, the company invested $40 million to purchase 654 BTC in its first major embrace of Bitcoin. Semler said it views Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset.
In June, Semler announced another $17 million Bitcoin acquisition of 247 BTC and said it planned to raise up to $150 million through an equity program to further boost its Bitcoin holdings. Earlier this month, they bought an additional 101 Bitcoin worth $6 million. 
"Semler remains focused on our two strategies of expanding our healthcare business and acquiring and holding Bitcoin," said CEO Doug Murphy-Chutorian in June. "We will continue to pursue our strategy of purchasing Bitcoins with cash."
Semler appears to be following MicroStrategy's Bitcoin treasury playbook. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has purchased over 225,000 bitcoins worth billions of dollars. Its Bitcoin bets have increased the company's enterprise value dramatically.
Other public companies, such as MARA, Metaplanet, and others, have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. More firms are realizing the potential benefits of holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset and hedge against inflation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The three spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong have surpassed HK$2 billion (around $272 million) in assets under management since launching earlier this year.

NEW: 🇭🇰 Hong Kong #Bitcoin ETFs surpass HK $2 billion in assets under management. 
China is getting prepared 🙌 pic.twitter.com/GQZC1Z5UFC
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 26, 2024
  
  
  
The milestone comes just months after Hong Kong approved its first spot bitcoin ETFs, following similar moves in the U.S. and Europe. The ETFs provide exposure to Bitcoin prices without directly owning Bitcoin.
While volumes have been slower than U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, assets under management have steadily climbed. This suggests a growing institutional appetite for regulated Bitcoin products in Asia.
The ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF is the largest of the Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs, with over $142 million in net assets. Bosera Hashkey's Bitcoin ETF comes next with around $99 million in holdings, followed by Harvest Bitcoin ETF with $31 million. Together, the total Bitcoin holdings across the three Hong Kong ETFs stand at approximately 4,450 BTC, worth $272 million at current prices.
Industry observers believe innovations like the ETFs' redemption method could attract more capital over time. The Hong Kong products allow for in-kind redemptions using actual Bitcoin, unlike cash-only U.S. ETFs.
The growth indicates increasing Bitcoin adoption by institutional investors in Asia. If interest in Hong Kong's spot Bitcoin ETFs continues at the current pace, they could emerge as a significant regional pool of Bitcoin demand.
Other Asian countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, and South Korea, are also in the pipeline to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. This could further integrate Bitcoin within mainstream finance across the continent.]]></summary>
