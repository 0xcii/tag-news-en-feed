        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated around the $30,000 level to start the weekend, as traders attempted to find a firm price floor on Saturday. The market has been volatile during the past week, as recent winners took profits, following the XRP-related bull run. Ethereum remained below $1,900 on Saturday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the weekend trading close to the $30,000 level, as markets consolidated following recent price volatility.
 
BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $30,046.00, which comes following an earlier low of $29,746.12.
 
The move sees bitcoin climb back above a recent support point of $29,800, which has held mostly firm for the past week.
 
 
One of the reasons for the stabilized floor is due to the relative strength index (RSI), which is hovering close to a support of its own at 49.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 49.77, with the next visible resistance point at the 50.00 mark.
 
In order for BTC to climb beyond the $30,000 mark, this ceiling on the RSI will first need to be broken.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum was also consolidating during today’s session, as the cryptocurrency remained below $1,900.
 
Following a high of $1,905.39 on Friday, ETH/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,885.30 earlier in today’s session.
 
Similar to BTC, ethereum’s decline saw the cryptocurrency fall to a key support point of $1,880 to start the weekend.
 
 
This comes as price strength hovers around its own floor around the 50.00 zone, which has been in place since the start of the week.
 
Despite this, it still appears that the 10-day (red) moving average is trending higher, however this could begin to shift in the coming days.

It may seem counterintuitive, but in my last four years serving for the U.S. Army, I’ve essentially been a customer service specialist, whether it’s addressing pay issues in the military pay office as a commander, or addressing travel or budget questions as a comptroller in an operational unit. 
Of late, I’ve found myself asking more questions of the customers than they’ve been asking of me. I’ve come to realize that many people don’t really understand the problems they are experiencing. And, because of this conundrum, the questions they ask me when seeking assistance may not yield an answer that actually solves those …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto market in France has experienced a significant surge in recent times, fueled mainly by the enthusiastic participation of young investors. 
 
As companies scramble to navigate new regulations, a substantial portion of Gen Z and millennial individuals fearlessly dive into digital assets. 
 
A recent survey conducted by crypto exchange KuCoin has revealed that approximately 8% of internet users aged 18 to 60 in France are actively involved in the digital currency space. A staggering 40% of this group is from the Gen Z demographic, spanning ages nine to 24. 
 

 
 
Despite facing financial constraints, with 60% of Gen Z bitcoin users earning less than 35,000 euros per year, these young investors display remarkable adaptability and interest in the crypto market.
