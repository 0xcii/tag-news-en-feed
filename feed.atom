Bitcoin Miners Have Been Receiving Low Fees Recently
 
As analyst James Van Straten pointed out in a new post on X, the BTC transaction fee has been floating around cycle lows recently. The “transaction fee” here naturally refers to the fee that users must attach with their transfers on the Bitcoin blockchain as a reward for the miner who processes them.
 
This metric’s value is generally directly related to the traffic that the network is observing. In times of high activity, transactions can stay stuck for long periods in the mempool, as the network only has a limited capacity to handle moves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain analysis now reveals that a single anonymous custodian, believed to be Cobo Custody, plays a crucial role in the Bitcoin network. In a post on X, one analyst said the custodian controls the Coinbase addresses of at least nine mining pools, cumulatively contributing at least 47% of the total hash rate. 
 
This means that for every 100 freshly mined BTC, 47 BTC are sent to this custodian. Concentrating control in one entity raises concerns about the potential risks and the need for transparency and decentralization of custodians among mining pools.
