Sure, it has been fun for a while, but soon enough, we started seeing more and more reports and news articles about how these incentives don’t accomplish their goal. No matter how many fancy perks there are, unless there’s a strong mission and an enticing model of work in an organization, flashy offices lose their appeal really fast.
 
Binance has never put much stock in superior office comfort as a means of attracting and retaining top talent. Don’t get them wrong – their offices offer some of these perks as well, but they’re never the main reason employees want to stay with the organization. That’s why Binance’s mission, and enabling employee growth, are the biggest motivators for their workforce.…]]></summary>

This warning comes in the wake of growing concerns over the alarming apathy exhibited by many crypto entities towards forthcoming marketing regulations, which could result in severe consequences if ignored.
 
The FCA’s four-page letter outlines its diligent efforts to establish a collaborative dialogue with digital currency firms, aiding them in navigating the new set of rules unveiled earlier this year. Notably, the regulatory body has extended the compliance deadline from October 8 to January 8, 2024, citing the need for technical refinements and the publi…]]></summary>

This rollercoaster ride has had a significant impact on two closely related tokens: SHIB and BONE. Both tokens have been experiencing extreme volatility in the crypto market, with sentiment and data surrounding Shibarium constantly shifting.
 
One of the key indicators reflecting the network’s recent challenges is the total value locked (TVL). On August 29, the TVL for Shibarium stood at a substantial $1.47 million. However, as of September 20, the TVL has plummeted to $630,012, highlighting a notable decline in liquidity and assets within the network. 
 
This dip in TVL has raised concerns among investors and observers alike, as it suggests a significant loss of confidence in the ecosystem.
