Centralized Vs. Decentralized: The Current State Of Crypto Trading Platforms
 
The WFE report underscores a pertinent challenge: the disparity in investor protection awareness among retail investors.

SEC’s Lawsuit Made Ripple Lose Stablecoin Deal
 
Schwartz revealed during a space on the X (formerly Twitter) platform that Ripple was close to signing a deal with an undisclosed stablecoin issuer in the last quarter of 2020, but the deal never materialized because it was around that period the SEC filed a lawsuit against the crypto firm.

“At the DMV, we’re always looking for ways to better serve Coloradans and leverage technology to offer our services,” said Senior Director Electra Bustle. “This new online cryptocurrency payment option is yet another way the DMV is providing innovative and convenient service delivery to our customers.”
Here's how it works: customers just have to select the cryptocurrency payment option, and they will be redirected to PayPal, where they can choose their preferred cryptocurrency to complete the transaction. The selected cryptocurrency is then converted into dollars, covering the total amount due along with applicable fees, before being remitted to the DMV.
However, it's important to note that there is a service fee associated with using cryptocurrency, amounting to $1 plus 1.83% of the total DMV charges. Additionally, PayPal may apply its own fees. As of now, PayPal is the sole cryptocurrency provider accepted for online DMV payments.
