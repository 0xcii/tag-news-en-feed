Amidst this chaos, crypto assets such as bitcoin demonstrated remarkable resilience, even capitalizing on the banking sector’s misfortunes. Concurrently, other repercussions unfolded, including the de-pegging of the second-largest stablecoin, managed by Circle, following the disclosure of difficulties in retrieving $3.3 billion from the now-insolvent Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).
