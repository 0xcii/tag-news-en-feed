Bitcoin Futures Market May Be Becoming Overheated
 
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC open interest has entered the overheat zone following the latest rally in the cryptocurrency’s price.
 
The “open interest” here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts open on all derivative exchanges in the sector. The metric naturally accounts for both short and long positions.
 
When the value of this indicator rises, it means that the investors are opening up more positions on the futures market right now. Generally, whenever this happens, the overall leverage in the market also goes up, and with leverage,…]]></summary>

The network has grown, it has changed, it has evolved. On a social level, an economic level, and a technical level it's a completely different animal than it was all those many years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was one of the biggest gainers on Tuesday, as price rose by as much as 8% in today’s session. The surge pushed the token to its strongest level since the middle of August, and closer to a key resistance zone. Toncoin was another notable gainer, climbing by over 6% today.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was a strong gainer on Tuesday, as the token rose by as much as 8% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $0.5634 to start the week, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.6127 earlier today.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, the world’s fifth largest cryptocurrency rose to its highest level since August 15.
 
 
Today’s move saw XRP climb for a third straight day, pushing the token close to a ceiling of $0.6400.
 
From the chart, it appears that the relative strength index (RSI) has broken a resistance point of 73.00, and is now sitting at 75.08.
 
In order to reach the aforementioned resistance level, the index will likely need to reach a ceiling at or above 80.00.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was another notable gainer on Tuesday, climbing to a one-month high during the day.
 
TON/USD hit a high of $2.23 earlier in the day, which comes a day after trading at a low of $2.09.
 
Owing to the move, toncoin rose to its highest point since September 28, when price was above $2.30.
 
 
Looking at the chart, recent gains have pushed price strength above a ceiling at 59.00, and the index is now tracking at 61.62.
 
The next visible point of resistance is at the 71.00 point, and if hit, there is a good chance TON moves towards $2.60.

This time, he and his lawyers seemed solely focused on changing the narrative that had already been put forward by the prosecution, including certain correspondences between Bankman-Fried and FTX’s former Director of Engineering Nishad Singh.
 
FTX Founder Says Messages To Singh Were Misunderstood
 
According to a report by Fortune, Bankman-Fried stated that Singh misinterpreted the text exchanges between them just before FTX filed for bankruptcy.
