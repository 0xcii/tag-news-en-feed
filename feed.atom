Breez, a Lightning solution service provider, has raised $4.5 million in an oversubscribed funding round led by ego death capital and Entrée Capital. Other industry funds that participated include Hivemind Ventures, Fulgur Ventures, Hawk Digital Innovation and Bitcoiner Ventures.

Is bitcoin volatile? How does one determine volatility? How can those with diamond hands so decisively say “no,” while those stuck in the fiat mindset so emphatically say “yes”? Which one is correct? Is it just that both sides have to agree to disagree, or can both of these seeming contradictions simultaneously be true? 
To truly answer these questions, we should first analyze Albert Einstein’s special theory of relativity…

This is an opinion editorial by Roy Sheinfeld, the cofounder and CEO of Breez, a Lightning Network mobile app.
Ready for a hot take? Check this: Money has no inherent value. And, besides being a special kind of money that allows for disintermediated transfers, the same applies to bitcoin. 
As banal as it may sound, money is just a means to an end. As a matter of fact, it’s a means to any number of ends. And those ends are what matter. Money — whether dollars, satoshis or the rai stones of Yap — is not valuable for what it is, but for what it lets us do. We transform money into experiences, and experiences are what make a life, not ledger entries. Everything else is bank propaga…]]></summary>

Crypto Twitter is currently philosophizing that it is strange timing that SBF is arrested by Bahamian authorities the day before his hearing in front of the US Congress.
 
Bankman-Fried is reportedly in custody awaiting extradition to the United States. As a result, Bankman-Fried will not be able to give his testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.
 
Instead, new FTX CEO John Ray will replace his predecessor. Remarkably, however, SBF already had a speech prepared to give today. Forbes managed to get a hold of that document.
