Hash price (revenue per terrahash) has reached historic lows as bitcoin’s block subsidy has been slashed. Meanwhile, the post-halving mempool frenzy has waned, adding fuel to the fire on already strained mining operators.
Nangeng Zhang, Founder and CEO of Singapore-based Canaan Inc, the creator of the first bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), sat down with Bitcoin Magazine for the firm’s first-ever interview with a North American media outlet to weigh in on the state of the industry.

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 91.94%
 
In a surprising turn of events, the Shiba Inu burn rate has seen a significant decline of 91.94%. This drop comes in the last 24 hours, underscoring the lack of attention to this metric, as well as the conservative stance that investors have taken during this time.
 
 
According to the Shiba Inu burn tracking website, Shibburn, there were only 2.367 million SHIB tokens burned in the last day. This is in stark contrast to the 29.5 million that were burned the prior day. Also, looking at the burn rates from this…]]></summary>

As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, Coinbase has observed a huge outflow for the seventh time this year. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “exchange outflow,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin leaving the wallets attached to a centralized exchange.
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means that the investors are currently withdrawing large amounts from the platform in question. Generally, holders take their coins out of the custody of these central entities whenever they plan to hold onto them for extended periods.
