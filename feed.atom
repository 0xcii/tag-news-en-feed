Analysts observe that the hard fork has slowed the number of coins going to the “furnace.” Accordingly, ETH is now more deflationary, considering the rising daily supply over the past weeks. 
 
The Impact Of Dencun On Gas Fees
 
Analysts say the Dencun Upgrade was one of the major updates after The Merge. With Dencun, Ethereum developers introduced proto-danksharding for more efficient and cheap transaction processing, especially by layer-2 platforms like Arbitrum. 
 
Besides helping reduce gas fees for layer-2 solutions, the update enhanced the mainnet scalability. Accordingly, the prim…]]></summary>
