It is worth noting that the two largest virtual currencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, followed a similar trajectory while market sentiments remained neutral over the past month. 
 
Low Market Sentiments Pushes Down Interest In Crypto
 
During the bull market, individual interest in digital assets skyrocketed to a peak in May 2021. But this has since changed hands due to bearish events that made some people and investors lose interest and confidence in the blockchain industry.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed 13 charges against  
cryptocurrency exchange Binance, two affiliated entities and Founder/CEO

securities and commingling customers’ funds. 
It also  
alleged that Binance operated as an exchange, broker-dealer and clearing agency

Exchange Inflows Of Major Crypto Assets Have Been Subdued Recently
 
According to the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, exchange inflows across the major assets are currently near cyclical lows. The “exchange inflow” is an indicator that measures the total amount of a given crypto that’s being transferred to the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means that the investors are depositing some tokens of the asset to these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons why holders would send their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the crypto’s pri…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP remained near a multi-month high to start the week, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly tracking lower. The global market cap has fallen by 1.58% as of writing, due to today’s red wave. Litecoin was a notable token to fall, dropping by nearly 5%.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, remained near a multi-month high on Monday, despite today’s bearish sentiment.
 
XRP/USD rose to a peak of $0.5447 to start the week, which is marginally lower than Sunday’s high at $0.5466.
 
As a result of this, ripple remains close to its highest level since March 30, which saw markets peak at $0.5575.
 
 
Overall, the drop off from Sunday comes as traders opt to secure gains, which coincides with the relative strength index (RSI) dropping out of a support point.
 
Price strength fell below the floor at 69.00 earlier in the day, and is currently tracking at 67.75.
 
Should momentum continue in this direction, XRP bears will likely target a floor at $0.5090.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
On the other hand, litecoin (LTC) was one of Monday’s biggest losers, as prices fell by as much as 5%.
 
Following a high of $96.36 on Sunday, LTC/USD sank to an intraday bottom at the $91.79 level.
 
This drop sees litecoin fall for a second consecutive session, after a false breakout of a ceiling at $96.00
 
 
Looking at the chart, prices were relatively overbought, with the RSI hovering close to a ceiling at 62.00, prior to the decline.
 
Previous LTC bulls likely shifted their positions due to the proximity with the aforementioned resistance point.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 52.00 after this sell-off, with a floor at 50.00 a potential landing zone.
