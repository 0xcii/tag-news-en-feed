However, with the German government done with all its selling, the Bitcoin price, as well as the crypto market, has rebounded in response, rising over 20% since then. Since the BTC price is higher now, here’s how much the German government’s holdings would be if it had not sold.
 
German Government’s 50,000 BTC Would Be Worth $3.27 Billion
 
The German government continued to dump its BTC even after the price had crashed, and by the time the last tranche of coins were sold, the Bitcoin price was trending around $53,000.

Schiff didn’t miss the chance to poke fun at Bitcoin by saying that it had dropped 30% since its record high in 2021. “Gold continues to show its worth as a stable and valuable product, while Bitcoin shines as a speculative bubble,” he said. His views come at a time when the price of Bitcoin is going through big changes, which adds to the fight between traditional assets and digital ones.
