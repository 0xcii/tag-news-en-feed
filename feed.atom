Jaydee noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that a symmetrical triangle had formed on the XRP price chart. According to him, the last time this chart pattern formed, the MACD crossed above zero, which triggered a parabolic move in XRP’s price. 
 
 
The price movement that he was referring to was the one that occurred in 2017 when the crypto token saw a 600x increase in its price. 
 

 
The crypto analyst was optimistic following this development as he…]]></summary>

The information comes to light following an audit conducted by BDO, a renowned auditing firm, as detailed in the official auditor's report.



The audited report provides a comprehensive analysis of Tether's financial standing, including more information on its Bitcoin holdings. Tether, known for its stablecoin USDT, has consistently played a massive role in the cryptocurrency market, facilitating transactions and maintaining a peg to the US Dollar.
"At Tether, we look forward to great 2024, with many new projects and products ready to come alive," said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. "I'm really excited by Tether's expansion. While Tether is mostly known for one product (USDT), the company is becoming an investor and infrastructure builder in many strategical sectors, spacing from AI to P2P telecommunications, from Bitcoin mining to renewable energy production."
The company also had a $2.85 billion profit for last quarter, of which about $1.85 billion came from gold and bitcoin holdings. For all of 2023, Tether achieved a profit of $6.2 billion.]]></summary>

We're talking a massive leap, over 140% in value – that's huge! It's not just about topping traditional rivals like gold; it's also about leaving other cryptocurrencies in the rearview mirror. Let’s dive into the on-chain action and the exchange buzz, trying to piece together clues to see what Bitcoin might be up to in the coming year.

New York Community Bancorp Shares Suffer 45% One-Day Collapse

Back then, Signature, Silicon Valley, and Silvergate each saw extensive bank failures. The shares of each bank sank ahead of the failures, tipping off the market that something was awry.
