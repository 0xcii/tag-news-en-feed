“USDC market cap is up after Binance pulled out,” Armstrong reportedly stuttered during Coinbase’s earnings call. “The unexpected answer seemed to imply that crypto exchange Binance was a holder of Circle and that USDC is safer now that Binance no longer holds the stablecoin,” the media outlet Protos writes in an exclusive report.

As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the pattern of the ETH Open Interest and Bollinger Bands may be used to analyze the market’s movements. The first of these metrics, the “Open Interest,” refers to a measure of the total amount of Ethereum futures contracts that are open on all derivative exchanges.
 
When the value of this indicator is high, it means that the investors currently have a large number of positions in the market currently. Generally, during such conditions, the total leverage in the market is also high, which can lead to the price displaying volatility.

An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment that tracks a specific asset or commodity, in this case, bitcoin. ETFs can be bought and sold on stock exchanges and brokerage accounts, with the custody of the underlying asset being held by the manager of the ETF. This allows for investors to get price exposure to bitcoin without having to worry about self-custody or figuring out how to use a bitcoin exchange. This would potentially give traditional investors peace of mind since they could purchase shares of a spot bitcoin ETF directly through their familiar brokerage accounts.
There are many types of Bitcoin ETFs available. The futures ETFs have had most success in being approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) thus far, but these track futures contracts …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference is thrilled to welcome renowned whistleblower and cybersecurity expert, Edward Snowden, to its landmark event, where he will share his insights on the intersection of digital currency, privacy, and the future of financial freedom during a 45 minute long online talk with a Q&A session. 
The event will take place in Westergas, Amsterdam on October 12-13, 2023 and will bring together industry leaders, enthusiasts, and experts to discuss the future of bitcoin, decentralization and freedom.




“In 2013, Ed Snowden alerted the American people to the fact that the US Government was knowingly conducting warrantless surveillance of its own citizens; a violation of basic rights. It was a watershed moment both for government overreach, as well as for the ability of individual freedom fighters and cypherpunks to push back. As Snowden announced to the world at Bitcoin 2019, Bitcoin was a key tool in his efforts to expose the ongoing surveillance,” said Brandon Green, Head of Events for BTC Inc. “10 years after his initial action, Snowden will talk to our community at Bitcoin Amsterdam about the ongoing fight to protect privacy for individuals, not just in the US, but around the world, and especially right here in Europe. And he will discuss the importance of Bitcoin in that fight,” continued Green.
As a prominent advocate for cybersecurity and freedom, Edward Snowden has long expressed his support for Bitcoin, stating "Bitcoin is free money... When I think about liberty, that’s what this is all about. It’s freedom from permission." 
He views it as an essential tool for preserving financial privacy and protecting individuals from surveillance and censorship. Snowden's endorsement of Bitcoin aligns with its core principles of decentralization, transparency, and financial sovereignty, making his appearance at the Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference highly anticipated.]]></summary>
