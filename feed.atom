        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pierre Rochard, VP of research at Riot Platforms testified yesterday that Bitcoin is a net positive for the state.
The Senate Committee on Business and Commerce heard testimony in regards to a Texas bill that would prohibit flexible load agreements between bitcoin miners and energy providers yesterday. 

The bill aims to ban the arrangements in which energy providers like ERCOT would pay bitcoin mining operators to turn off their facilities, effectively freeing the now-excess energy for usage during emergencies or high demand time periods. 
Bitcoin Policy Institute Senior Fellow Natalie Smolenski notes in a tweet that the bill also seeks to “Ban tax abatements for miners in Texas because ‘mining is already projected to grow in the state’”



Riot Platforms’ Vice President of Research Pierre Rochard testified that the presence of the company in Texas has beneficial impacts on rural communities, employment and energy production. 



“Bitcoin miners are the number one employer in Rockdale. Bitcoin miners are also the number one taxpayer to Rockdale ISD. Bitcoin mining is good for rural education.”
“Even if you are skeptical of bitcoin, these abatements have been highly effective at revitalizing rural communities.” 
Proponents of the bill, like its sponsor State Senator Lois Kolkhorst, cites the state’s goal of increasing energy production, saying that the mining industry’s usage of this energy and subsequent shutoff arrangements with ERCOT “is a part of their business model.”
But as Bitcoin Magazine’s Mark Goodwin notes, energy production curves of renewables, which represents a growing proportion of the state’s energy, will potentially improve, not degrade, with the usage of bitcoin mining.]]></summary>

XRP Profit-Taking Volume Is Currently More Than Two Times The Loss-Taking Volume
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, a large amount of profit taking is currently taking place from XRP investors. The relevant indicator here is the “ratio of transaction volume in profit to loss,” which tells us about how the current daily profit-taking volume of the asset is compared against the loss-taking one.
 
The indicator separates profit-taking volume from the loss-taking one by going through the on-chain history of each coin being sold to see what price it was last moved at.

Global peer-to-peer Bitcoin platform Paxful announced it will provide almost nine bitcoin worth ~$250,000.00 to its Paxful Earn users who were affected by the Celsius collapse. 
The funds will be transferred to Paxful wallets this week. Paxful Earn was launched in partnership with Celsius to offer Paxful users a chance to earn yield on their Bitcoin. However, users were unable to withdraw their funds from Celsius when the latter collapsed, leaving Paxful paralyzed and unable to retrieve the funds. Around 600,000 interest-bearing accounts, including Paxful Earn users, were affected when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn ruled that assets in Celsius Earn accounts belonged to Celsius’ bankruptcy estate, not to the users.
Ray Youssef, founder and CEO of Paxful, said, “The courts failed these Celsius users. The U.S. government is more than willing to bailout traditional banks, but Bitcoin users do not seem to be their priority. That does not sit right with me, and I have taken action to make sure Paxful Earn users receive their full Celsius funds.” 
Since the Celsius collapse, Paxful has been encouraging Bitcoin self-custody and advocating for users to hold their own Bitcoin. Paxful also supports financial literacy and transparency, having recently donated funds to build the Bitcoin Technology Center in Ghana to spread financial education.
Youssef stated that customer trust is hard to earn and even harder to keep, and he would always put Paxful’s users first. According to him, the company's primary focus is the customer and has launched various initiatives to support its customers. He cites the company’s involvement in charity and social impact work, such as providing funds to build a school in Rwanda and donating money to assist with pandemic relief efforts in India.]]></summary>

This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, a content creator and small business owner.
The events of the last few weeks have spooked investors and regional banks alike. More importantly, the people who go to work and make the economy run are starting to question whether their bank deposits are safe. Fears of more bank runs after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank, Silvergate Bank and Credit Suisse are rampant.
And these fears are not unfounded, if you ask me. For instance, when you turn on the TV and see that First Republic needs a $30 billion bailout to stay afloat, it doesn’t inspire confide…]]></summary>
