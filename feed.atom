“The smartest people in the world are working on Bitcoin, they’re not working on some other project,” Mike Jarmuz told Bitcoin Magazine. “They’re not working on altcoins or selling real estate in a metaverse fantasy land. Your medical records are not going onto some other thing masquerading as a blockchain. We view these as ridiculous and completely uninvestable ideas.”
Jarmuz is the the managing partner of an investment fund called Lightning Ventures, whose peculiarity is that it focuses its investments solely on companies that develop products and services on bitcoin and no other cryptocurrency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Investor Kevin “Mr. Wonderful” O’Leary gave more details about his participation in failed crypto exchange FTX and his insight on its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). The crypto trading venue lost billions of its customers’ funds, including O’Leary and other prominent investment firms. 
 
 
In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, Mr. Wonderful talked about his transition from a crypto detractor to a defender. He claimed the global crypto regulatory environment shifted him to embrace the nascent asset class. 
 
“Mr. Wonderful” went from classifying Bitcoin and crypto as “garbage” to investing millions in digital assets. This investment turned to ashes as FTX collapsed and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. A process that is still ongoing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin fell for a third consecutive session on Thursday, as the token continued to move away from recent highs. Cryptocurrencies have been mostly lower in recent days, as traders continue to fear a global recession. Cosmos also remained in the red during today’s session. 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) dropped to a ten-day low on Thursday, with the token falling for a third straight session.
 
Following a high of $79.20 on Wednesday, LTC/USD moved to a low of $74.82 earlier in the day’s session.
 
As a result of this, the token fell to its lowest point since November 29, when prices hit a bottom of $73.39.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that litecoin bears are hoping to push prices towards a floor at $73.00.
 
This seems a possibility, especially with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fast approaching a floor of its own.
 
The index is currently tracking at 57.10, and seems to be moving towards a support point of 53.00.
 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Another notable token on Thursday has been cosmos (ATOM), which fell to a ten-day low earlier in the day.
 
ATOM/USD fell to a bottom of $9.52 on Thursday, before bulls reentered the market and bought the recent dip.
 
Today’s bottom saw cosmos trade at its lowest level since November 28, which was the last time the token hit its floor at $9.45.
 
 
As of writing, ATOM has mostly rebounded, and is currently trading at the $9.71 level.
 
In addition to this, the RSI has bounced from a floor of its own at 39.50, and is currently tracking at 41.40.
 
Should momentum continue in an upward direction, ATOM bulls will likely target a move above the $10.00 mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to slip on Thursday, with the coin remaining close to its lowest level since the end of November. Momentum in cryptocurrency markets has shifted in recent days, with sentiment currently bearish. Ethereum was also lower, with the token dropping towards $1,200.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) remained near a one-week low on Thursday, as cryptocurrencies continued to trade in the red.
 
BTC/USD slipped to a bottom of $16,750.56 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $17,061.48.
 
The move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency move closer to a recent support point of $16,700.
 
 
After failing to break out of a ceiling at the 50.00 level earlier in the week, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 45.50.
 
Should price strength continue to plummet, the next visible point of support seems to be at the 43.00 mark.
 
Bears in the market will be hoping that this floor is not only hit, but broken, which could trigger a move below $16,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Like bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also edged lower in today’s session, with prices falling for a second straight day.
 
Following a high of $1,252.30 on Wednesday, ETH/USD dived to a low of $1,224.45 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s drop in price pushed ethereum below a recent support point at the $1,230 level, with prices hitting a nine-day low as a result.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 10-day (red) moving average remains high, which some see as a signal that a bullish reversal could still be on the cards.
 
Despite this, momentum seems bearish, with the RSI tracking at 46.72, which is its lowest point since November 29.
 
The index now appears to be heading towards a support point at the 45.00 level.
