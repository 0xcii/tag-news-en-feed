“Platforms” here not only include the exchanges, but also the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were only approved to operate in the US in January of this year.
 
When the value of this ratio goes up, it means the US-based platforms are seeing their reserve go up relative to the off-shore ones. Such a trend could suggest interest is shifting …]]></summary>
