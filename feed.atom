        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Competition for blockspace is and always will be one of the core tensions that exist between different users of the Bitcoin protocol. At the end of the day there are only two restrictions on how it will be used, the technical and consensus layer of what is actually possible or allowed by the protocol, and the economic layer of what people are willing to pay to make use of blockspace to different ends. 
This is a fundamental and inescapable reality of how the network works. It is a purely market driven distributed mechanism for deciding how Bitcoin is used. Concerning anything that is possible to do, the market is the ultimate decider as to whether or not it will be done. The market is also the ultimate decider when it comes to enabling new things that are not already possible.

The move signals a stricter regulatory approach aimed at curbing manipulation and boosting oversight, aligning with the European Union’s broader push for crypto regulation.
 
 
Million-Dollar Fines For Market Mayhem
 
According to a Reuters report, the proposed decree takes a zero-tolerance stance on crypto misconduct. Activities like insider trading, market manipulation, and unlawful disclosure of sensitive information could land offenders with hefty fines ranging from €5,000 to a staggering €5 million (roughly $5,400 to $5.4 million).
 
This financial hammer blow signifies Italy’s commitment to protecting investors and fostering a fair and stable crypto ecosystem.

Bennett mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the recent “relative weakness” suggests that the crypto market, including Bitcoin, will get “hammered” if the stock market rolls over. The analyst made this statement based on the correlation between the stock and the crypto market. He had also noted that things weren’t great for the crypto market, especially considering that the S&P, Nasdaq, and other stocks have been enjoying an upward trend for weeks.
