This could end up being a turning point, considering that the crypto firm had noted in its motion that the “court would benefit” if it were allowed to file a Sur-reply to the SEC’s latest motion. 
 
Court Allows Ripple To File A Sur-Reply
 
Filan stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the court had granted Ripple’s motion to file a Sur-reply, meaning that the crypto firm can now file an additional reply to the SEC’s motion. The Commission had initially filed a motion to compel Ripple to produce certain documents. The crypto firm then filed a response arguing why the court should not grant this motion.

This flicker of green has ignited contrasting viewpoints from market watchers, including CNBC’s Jim Cramer, whose recent advice has raised eyebrows.
 
Cramer, known for his sometimes contrarian takes, has taken a cautious stance on Bitcoin’s recent rally. While acknowledging the positive momentum, he expressed concerns about the cryptocurrency’s ability to sustain this upward climb due to potential lack of fresh capital entering the market.

The report acknowledges the recent 20% correction in BTC’s price over the past two weeks, attributing it largely to profit-taking on previous GBTC investments. JP Morgan analysts note, “Profit-taking on GBTC’s ‘discount to NAV trade’ has likely been a major driver behind Bitcoin’s correction; $4.3 billion has thus far exited GBTC since its conversion to ETF.”
