The government said they will have a preference for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC), as they provide all the benefits of private cryptocurrencies, without having the potential for instability or potential for misuse.
 
 
Regulators added that CBDCs don’t necessarily need to meet the goals of financial inclusion often associated with cryptocurrencies. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) supports CBDCs as this can achieve a safer alternative that can still attain financial inclusion goals usually tied to cryptocurrency.
