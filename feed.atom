        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin research and development center, Brink, has announced the renewal of a year-long grant for Sebastian Falbesoner, also known as theStack. “As part of his grant renewal application, he emphasized the importance of BIP324 Version 2 P2P transport and why he plans to spend his review time on the project,” the announcement read.
BIP324 aims to address the vulnerability of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P) communication layer, where messages are currently transmitted unencrypted. Sebastian highlights the need for opportunistic encryption between Bitcoin nodes to combat censorship, privacy breaches, and other attacks. He explains, "BIP324 tries to counter these deficiencies by adding opportunistic encryption between Bitcoin nodes, making it significantly harder for adversaries to conduct these attacks."
The proposal incorporates a protocol that obscures the initiation of connections between peers, ensuring minimal information is revealed to external observers. This is achieved through the use of ElligatorSwift, a modern elliptic curve point encoding scheme. Additionally, an extra chunk of random bytes, known as "garbage," is exchanged during connection initiation to further obfuscate the size of packets, hindering detection by potential attackers.
Sebastian expressed his fascination with BIP324's pseudorandom approach, stating, "If we imagine a world where this v2 encrypted transport protocol is used predominantly ... censorship of any Bitcoin participant on the network level will be significantly harder." He highlights that deep packet inspection and man-in-the-middle attacks would become far more challenging to execute.
Recognizing the significance of BIP324 for ensuring Bitcoin's censorship-resistance on the P2P layer, Brink has extended Sebastian's part-time grant for another year. Sebastian plans to conduct thorough code reviews, test the remaining BIP324 pull requests, and run a publicly accessible BIP324-compatible node once a functional pull request is available.]]></summary>

The first of these phases is the “bull market.” Glassnode has picked the cycle low as the start point for this phase and the cycle top as the endpoint. The second phase would be the “bear market,” which is simply the reverse of the bull market: it starts at the top and ends at the n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose above $27,000 for the first time in two weeks, as price broke out of a key resistance level on Tuesday. Bullish sentiment continues to make a gradual return, following recent market weakness. Ethereum remained over the $1,700 level during today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin rose to a two-week high on Tuesday, as bullish sentiment made a gradual return to the marketplace.
 
Following a low of $26,338.54 to start the week, BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $27,147.47 on Tuesday.
 
As a result of the surge in price, bitcoin rose to its strongest point since June 7, when it peaked at $27,402.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that today’s rally coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) also breaking out of a ceiling of its own at the 50.00 mark.
 
Price strength now stands at 51.71 at the time of writing, with the next visible resistance level at 57.00.
 
In the event bulls are able to send the index to this point, there is a good chance that BTC will be above $27,500.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was marginally in the green in today’s session, with price hovering close to a recent support point.
 
ETH/USD hit an intraday peak of $1,748.64 earlier in the day, before retreating to a low less than 24 hours after climbing from a floor at $1,705.81.
 
Since this earlier high, ethereum has slipped back to a support point at $1,725, a point where it has consolidated for the past four days.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this retreat occurred as the RSI ran into a ceiling of its own at the 44.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index now sits at the 42.21 mark, and appears to be heading to a lower floor at 40.00.
 
Should strength fall below that mark, there is a good chance that ETH will drop below $1,700 in the coming days.
