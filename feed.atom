Because Base periodically bundles transactions and confirms them on the Ethereum mainnet, transaction fees should be lower. In this arrangement, for fees to be in their millions, it means Friend.tech processed tens of millions of unique transactions.

The “mining hashrate” is an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that the miners have currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
This metric can have a direct impact on the strength of the network’s security. This is because the more mining rigs are attached to the chain, the more difficult it is to perform a 51% attack.
 
This is only given, of course, that the hashrate is sufficiently decentralized. With the rise of large public miners, there have been concerns that the hashrate is increasingly becoming centralized, but the latest data has revealed that these public ent…]]></summary>

Prosecutors claim that FTX directed customers' funds
