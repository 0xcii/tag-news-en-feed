All The Top Assets In Crypto Sector Have Seen Lowering Volumes Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, volumes in the crypto market have taken a hit recently. The “trading volume” here refers to a measure of the total amount of a given asset that the holders are moving on the blockchain right now.

Bitcoin: A Volatility Regime Change On The Horizon?
 
The Bitcoin market has been relatively dormant recently, with its price lingering below the $30,000 mark. This stagnation has led to the tightest ever Bitcoin Bollinger Bands. Glassnode’s chief analyst, Checkmatey, took to Twitter to share his observations:

Imagine this: It’s payday but before the money reaches your account, someone else has already decided what you’ll spend your money on — one third of your paycheck on housing, one third on food (only plant and insect protein allowed), 10% on transportation (with little allowance for gas), 10% on a mandatory pension plan (mostly allocated to government bonds) and the remaining 14% on clothing, alcohol and pharmaceuticals in state-licensed shops. Spending outside of these allocations comes with huge markups and, as if this isn’t bad enough, saving is impossible as this money comes with an expiration date: after three months, it simply disappears from your account.

Trump Holds Ethereum
 
Trump’s 2023 Financial Disclosure filed with the United States Office of Government Ethics (OGE) has revealed that the former president holds up to half a million in Ethereum. As part of his assets, Trump listed a cryptocurrency wallet that contains Ether valued between $250,001 to $500,000.

 Don’t be fooled by the calm though, as currently lackluster chart action does not reflect the potentially momentous shifts taking place in the crypto industry as a whole, which revolve around institutional interest in BTC and ETH (and then perhaps, everything else too), and within which developments at  Coinbase are important.
