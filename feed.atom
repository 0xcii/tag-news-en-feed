The Bitcoin Mining Event In Focus
 
Taking to X, Ted believes BTC prices will float higher after Bitcoin halves in April 2024. This event, set at the protocol level and scheduled roughly every four years (or after 240,000 blocks), will significantly reduce the amount of coins entering the market. 
 
 
The reduction in this supply will make BTC deflationary, possibly increasing prices. This outlook is considering the expected demand that will continue to rise in 2024.
 
The Bitcoin network disburses 6.25 BTC roughly every 10 minutes, meaning 900 BTC is mined daily. After halving, that number will drop to 450 BT…]]></summary>

In a new post on X, CryptoQuant CEO and founder Ki Young Ju has talked about how the US-based Bitcoin miners are behaving so far in the leadup to the upcoming halving.
 
The “halving” here refers to a periodic event for Bitcoin in which the cryptocurrency’s block rewards are permanently slashed in half. This event occurs every four years; the next one is estimated to happen this April.
