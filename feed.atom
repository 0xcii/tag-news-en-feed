In the wake of significantly lower-than-expected inflation numbers (CPI and PPI) and the much-anticipated pivot by the Federal Reserve in the US, the Bitcoin price was able to continue its bullish trend of the past few weeks and reached a new yearly high of $30,968 last Friday.
 
After the last few weeks were always jam-packed with important macro data, there are virtually no key data points in the upcoming two weeks. Only on May 03, this will change, when the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the US Federal Reserve is scheduled.
 
Thus, there is a bullish vacuum until early May, in which it seems likely that the entire crypto market and Bitcoin will continue their rally. Still, there are a few events…]]></summary>
