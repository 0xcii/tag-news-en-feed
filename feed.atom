Yet, the project’s native token, SHIB, has seen a decline of over 4% in the past week and a substantial drop of more than 18% in the previous month.
 
Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Booms With Wallets, But Tokens Navigate Choppy Waters
 
On August 30, 2023, Bitcoin.com News highlighted that Shiba Inu’s L2 scaling solution, Shibarium, was operating smoothly after facing initial challenges. Back then, the count stood at roughly 157,685 wallets. Fast forward to today, and that number has catapulted to over 1.1 million — marking a 598% surge in just under a week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stellar surged by as much as 7% on Monday, despite sentiment in crypto markets being mostly bearish to start the week. The token rallied for a second straight session, after a recent collision with a key price floor. Toncoin also rose, hitting a fresh multi-month high. 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
XLM was one of Monday’s biggest movers, as the cryptocurrency rose by as much as 7% in today’s session.
 
After trading at a low of $0.1147 on Sunday, XLM/USD moved to an intraday peak of $0.126 earlier in the day.
 
This surge sees stellar climb higher for a second consecutive day, following a rebound from a floor at $0.110.
 
 
Earlier gains have already begun to ease, which comes due to the relative strength index (RSI) colliding with a ceiling of 49.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 49.48, with the next point of resistance around 54.00.
 
Overall, bulls seem to have set their sights on the $0.135 level.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) also moved higher to start the week, with the token hitting a fresh multi-month high in the process.
 
TON/USD peaked at $1.93 on Labor Day, which comes following a low of $1.85 during Sunday’s session.
 
As a result of the move, toncoin climbed to its strongest point since May 8, when the price reached a high of $2.08.
 
 
The RSI on TON continues to reside over the 70.00 mark, meaning that price strength remains overbought.
 
This has not prevented bulls from continuing to send the token higher, with the $2.00 level the perceived target for traders.

The uncertainty stems from a combination of factors, including the latest decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and broader macroeconomic concerns.
 
August concluded with Bitcoin experiencing a setback as it relinquished its gains following the SEC’s decision to delay its ruling on a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). 
 
This regulatory delay has raised questions about the timing of potential mainstream adoption of Bitcoin investment vehicles.
