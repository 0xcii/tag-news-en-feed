where free messenger apps have almost completely dominated traditional text  
messages, it might seem that after over 30 years, popular “texts” have already  
become obsolete. Although we do not use them in everyday communication, they  
are still willingly used as a common medium for marketing and promotion.  
Unfortunately, not only among legitimate businesses but also among scammers.
After conducting  
our own analysis and conversations with industry experts Finance Magnates  
can clearly confirm that SMS scams are still a common problem, especially in  
the cryptocurrency industry. Unscrupulous actors exploit very simple loopholes  
in outdated technology by impersonating popular brands, trying to steal user

Hydro's ban on crypto mining projects. This decision will have significant  
effects on both the energy sector and the growing crypto industry.
Justice Michael Tammen deemed B.C. Hydro's 18-month  
moratorium on crypto mining projects is reasonable and within legal bounds. The  
moratorium, implemented in December 2022, was challenged by Conifex Timber, a  
forestry company venturing into crypto mining in partnership with the Tsay Keh  
Dene Nation, an indigenous tribe.
Rationale Behind the Ban
The court ruling emphasized that B.C. Hydro's ban
