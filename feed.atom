        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia's leading stock exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), has approved listing the second Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on its platform.

BREAKING: 🇦🇺 Australia’s largest stock exchange has approved its second spot #Bitcoin ETF. pic.twitter.com/SY5vIGEm4a
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 9, 2024
  
  
  
On July 9th, the ASX gave the green light to digital asset manager DigitalX to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF. The new ETF will begin trading on July 12th under the ticker BTXX.
This comes just weeks after the ASX approved its first Bitcoin ETF in June when it listed the VanEck Bitcoin ETF. The moves follow the successful debut of several Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. beginning in early 2024.
Australia has been building momentum in Bitcoin ETFs over the past year. The country's first spot Bitcoin ETF, the 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (EBTC), launched in April 2022 and trades on the Cboe Australia exchange.
Most recently, in June, the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) also began trading on the Cboe. Now, ASX is following suit by approving its second Bitcoin ETF after VanEck's product became the first last month.
The flurry of new Bitcoin investment vehicles hitting the Australian market reflects the growing interest in Bitcoin exposure. Investors are increasingly looking to gain Bitcoin exposure through regulated fund structures rather than direct ownership.
ETFs provide an easy avenue to invest in the asset class without needing to custody Bitcoin directly. Many expect more countries to approve Bitcoin ETFs as the instruments gain traction and regulatory acceptance expands.
By greenlighting another Bitcoin ETF, Australia's main securities exchange demonstrates a favourable shift in attitudes toward Bitcoin assets within one of the world's top financial markets.]]></summary>

Arguably the most recognizable exchange names are Binance and Coinbase, but right now it’s Bybit that is catching attention, as the numbers showed it leapfrogging Coinbase to take the number two spot behind market leader Binance, while also significantly outperforming Binance in terms of market share changes.
 In detail, Bybit–which is headquartered in Singapore and was founded in 2018–has, from October last year to this June, seen its market share double from 8% to 16%, while Binance’s share has dropped over the same time period from 60% to 54%.

However, Bitfinex, a leading Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange, in a recent analysis report has predicted that Bitcoin could be nearing a potential local bottom, suggesting that its recent decline might be coming to an end.
 
Is The Bitcoin Decline About To End?
 
The cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex revealed its forecast for Bitcoin on Monday, in its most recent Alpha-112 report. This prediction coincides with the heavy BTC sell-offs lately, which might have impacted the crypto asset negatively, leading to notable declines in the past few days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on significant crypto legislation on Wednesday, July 10. This vote might override President Joe Biden’s veto of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) resolution to repeal Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121). In June, Biden vetoed this bill. It has garnered significant attention due to its impact on the custody of Bitcoin and other crypto assets by financial institutions.
 
The SEC issued SAB 121 in 2022, which mandates that banks holding cryptocurrency must disclose these assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. Many in the crypto industry have questioned this accounting treatment, claiming that the additional regulatory burden deters banks and other institutional actors from dealing with digital assets.

On Monday, a panel of the Republican National Committee (RNC) approved a draft of the party’s 2024 platform that includes strong support for the largest cryptocurrency in the market and the overall industry.
