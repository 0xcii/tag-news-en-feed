Ethfinance: Friend Request Gone Wrong
 
The unnamed investor, according to the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI), was introduced to Ethfinance through a “random friend request on LinkedIn.” This seemingly innocuous online interaction turned into a financial nightmare. Lured by the promise of high returns on cryptocurrency trading, the investor transferred a total of $310,000 from their DeFi wallet to Ethfinance.

BREAKING: MicroStrategy increased its raise to $700 million to buy more #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/B2I2uk98Ie
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 14, 2024
  
  
  
MicroStrategy first announced plans on Thursday to raise $500 million by selling convertible senior notes to qualified institutional buyers. The proceeds would primarily go toward acquiring more Bitcoin for its corporate treasury, which already contains over 214,400 BTC worth $15 billion.
The software analytics firm then boosted the offering to $700 million on Friday. The company said the offering is expected to close on June 17th.
MicroStrategy has aggressively accumulated bitcoin since 2020 under Saylor's direction. It utilizes debt to fund its Bitcoin buying, taking advantage of market volatility. The company cited its confidence that Bitcoin will continue appreciating over the long term.
By selling convertible senior notes, MicroStrategy gains flexibility. The notes pay interest and mature in 2032, but noteholders can convert into MicroStrategy stock before maturity.
This structure allows investors to benefit from potential Bitcoin price upside through the stock conversion option. It also shields note holders from downside risk due to their senior unsecured status.
MicroStrategy said it may use proceeds not allocated to Bitcoin purchases for general corporate purposes. However, its intent is clearly to expand its Bitcoin trove while prices remain depressed.
The additional capital injection signals MicroStrategy's continued conviction in Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Saylor is doubling down by acquiring more coins amid the current market turbulence.]]></summary>

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 14, 2024
  
  
  
In a new report initiating coverage of Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, Bernstein analysts have raised their price target for Bitcoin to $200,000 from $150,000 by the end of 2025.
Bernstein has long been positive on Bitcoin's prospects, but this $1 million forecast by 2033 represents one of the highest institutional projections yet. The analysts' thesis is based on unprecedented demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs and constrained future supply.
Bernstein's report also highlighted how Michael Saylor "has become synonymous with brand Bitcoin and has positioned MSTR as a leading Bitcoin company, attracting at-scale capital (both debt and equity) for an active Bitcoin acquisition strategy."
"MicroStrategy positions itself as an 'active leveraged bitcoin strategy versus passive spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs),' the report said, noting that over the last four years, the company's active strategy has produced a higher Bitcoin per equity share," Bernstein wrote.
Bernstein also set a $2,890 price target on MicroStrategy shares, representing nearly double the current price.
The bold long-term Bitcoin outlook comes as institutions warm up to Bitcoin, with major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity offering BTC investment products. Bernstein cited inflows into these regulated vehicles as fueling this cycle's exponential Bitcoin price gains.
The analysts see MicroStrategy maintaining its first-mover advantage as the world's leading listed Bitcoin player. With BTC adoption still in its infancy, firms like MicroStrategy have room to grow their Bitcoin holdings for years to come.]]></summary>

Fast forward a decade, and memecoins, those internet joke-inspired tokens, are a barking mad force in the crypto economy, amassing a market cap of nearly $60 billion, according to Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz.
 
 
This growth is attributed to the increasing popularity of internet memes and their ability to tap into the humor and creativity of the online community. The figure above is a substantial amount, especially when compared to the market caps of traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Indeed, nemecoins, as Novogratz would say, is ‘one of the most powerful narratives’ in the crypto market as we speak.
