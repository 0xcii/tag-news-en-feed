        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent Bloomberg report sheds light on the predictions of Reggie Browne, the head of ETF trading at market-maker GTS, regarding the trading dynamics of a Bitcoin ETF’s potential approval on Wednesday. 
 
Bitcoin ETF Applications Poised For ‘Meaningful’ Premium?
 
Per the report, Browne suggests that if approved, the ETF applications by the asset managers could trade at a meaningful premium to its net asset value (NAV), potentially reaching an 8% premium. 
 
The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which holds Bitcoin futures, has maintained an average premium of 0.02% over the past year. 
 
 
However, Browne warns about the complexity of trading spot Bitcoin directly and the challenges it may pose for ETF price alignment with the underlying Bitcoin.

In a post on X, Alfred also noted that MicroStrategy is down 5% and is trading as “if the market expects the spot ETFs to be approved soon.”
 
MicroStrategy’s Premium Will Fall, MSTR Prices Will Drop
 
Despite the expected reduction in MicroStrategy’s premium, Alfred believes its stock price, currently trading at around $600, may recover steadily in the next bull run. 
 
 
Looking at the MSTR stock in the daily chart, prices appear to be topping out. Share prices rose to as high as $717 in the first week of January before dropping 16% to spot rates. The sell-off continues when writing with critical primary support…]]></summary>

This erroneous message from the official Twitter of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sparked a rapid increase in bitcoin’s price, soaring close to $48,000 per unit. Yet, this surge was short-lived as the price promptly dropped to around $45,000 once the market recognized the false nature of the announcement.

encountered a significant stir as its Twitter account appeared to announce  
approvals for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) prematurely. 
However, contrary to the tweet's assertion, SEC  
Chair Gary Gensler confirmed that no spot Bitcoin ETF applications had received  
approval as of Tuesday afternoon. The regulator's official statement debunked  
the tweet due to an account compromise, underscoring that the SEC had not  
endorsed the listing or trading of such ETFs.

The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.
— Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) January 9, 2024
Despite this incident, expectations loom for the  
SEC's future approval of spot Bitcoin ETF applications, though no such approval  
had transpired by the time of the compromised tweet. 
The SEC's Statement
Gensler took to his Twitter account to clarify the  
misunderstanding, affirming the lack of authorization to spot Bitcoin ETFs. The  
SEC's spokesperson echoed this sentiment via email, categorically denying the  
legitimacy of the tweet that circulated misinformation regarding Bitcoin ETF  
approvals.
Similarly, the SEC's Twitter account highlighted the fuss caused by the manipulated announcement about approving the Bitcoin ETFs. Its official statement, arising from a compromised account, firmly stated that the SEC didn't support or approve the trading or listing of these ETFs.

The @SECGov X account was compromised, and an unauthorized post was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.
