Forrest alleges Meta (which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services) facilitated a massive crypto scam campaign that used his image and deepfakes to swindle millions from unsuspecting victims.

The heart of the issue lies in money transmitter licenses, crucial for exchanges to operate legally. North Dakota’s Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) became the latest state to throw a flag on Binance.US, citing non-compliance with local regulations and violations of money transmitter laws.

André Dragosch, Head of Research at ETC Group, points out that crypto hedge funds have dramatically scaled back their BTC exposure. Over the past 20 trading days, exposure has fallen to a mere 0.37, the lowest since October 2020, Dragosch revealed.

These humongous holders are considered the most influential on the network due to the massive scale of tokens they control. Their collective behavior can be worth keeping an eye on, as even if it may not directly impact the price, it can tell us about the sentiment among this cohort.
