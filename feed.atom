The filing in question, which is still available on the website of Delaware’s Division of Corporations, bears a striking resemblance to genuine registrations commonly connected with the renowned asset management firm.
 
The “iShares XRP Trust” registered to BlackRock was the subject of a prominent item on the Division of Corporations website of the Delaware Department of State. The value of XRP briefly increased by about 15% as a result of the agitation this false filing created in the cryptocurrency community.
