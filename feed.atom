The Whip Question revealed that Democratic leaders expect bills H. R. 4763 and H. R. 5403 to come to the floor this week. As a result, they have presented their issues with the bills despite not forcing the House Democrats to vote against them.

Rusty plans to restore several abandoned features from Bitcoin's code, a bold move that could significantly enhance the functionality and expressivity of Bitcoin scripts.

Understanding the New Costing Model
One of the central aspects of the "Great Script Restoration" proposal is the introduction of a new costing model for opcodes. Currently, in Bitcoin, every operation costs the same, regardless of its computational complexity. This model, however, does not accurately reflect the true cost of script execution, leading to potential inefficiencies and limitations.

Bitcoin allows for the permanent inscribing of data onto the public record. Still, whistleblowing on the blockchain remains a terrible idea.
Leaking information is risky business. If you’ve obtained sensitive information — particularly if you’re not supposed to be in possession of said information in the first place — you can’t just send out an email or post it to your Twitter feed. If you did, before you knew it, you’d be tracked, identified, and thrown in jail, while the data you obtained would quickly be deleted.
