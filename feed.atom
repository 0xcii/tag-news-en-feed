Previous statements indicate that Shibarium will launch on the mainnet before the end of 2023, but audits are planned before that, as Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama recently revealed. One token that will become significantly more important to the SHIB ecosystem once Shibarium is live is Bone ShibaSwap (BONE).
 
Shiba Inu Developer Clears FUD
 
BONE will be the only token that can be used to pay gas fees on Shibarium. This means that the token will have an additional use case that is of extremely high importance. Every transaction on the layer-2 network must be paid in BONE.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Montana has ratified legislation that protects the right to mine bitcoin, a win for sound money in the midwestern state.
The Montana legislature has passed a bill that protects the right to mine bitcoin, among other provisions. The bill is designed to give Bitcoin miners the right to mine “without being subjected to undue discrimination or requirements.”
Bitcoin mining has faced difficulty with regulations at the state and local level before, so this bill provides legal certainty for the industry. Montana is among the first states to provide legal protection for bitcoin mining.
The new legislation would also prohibit discriminatory digital asset mining utility rates, prohibit local government powers related to digital asset mining, and prohibit specific taxation on the use of cryptocurrency as a payment method. 
Additionally, the bill provides for digital assets as personal property. According to the bill, the Montana Public Service Commission may not establish a rate classification for digital asset mining, digital asset mining businesses or home digital asset mining that creates unduly discriminatory rates. The bill also states that digital assets used as a method of payment may not be subject to additional taxation or charges by the state or local government.
The bill would help Montana's economy by giving legal certainty to the digital asset mining industry, encouraging investment in Montana, and attracting new businesses to the state. The bill also helps to ensure the stability of Montana's power grid.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Web3 bug bounty platform Immunefi launched two years ago, CEO and founder Mitchell Amador says the bug bounties weren't great and adoption was slow. But the tides started to turn because even if exploiting a smart contract nets a bigger payday than a bounty, it comes with a huge drawback. "There's a ton of risk when you engage in this, you know, wantonly criminal behavior and steal $200 million from someone else," he said. "There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>

Now Marco Santori, the company's chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
