The order comes after Wright's decisive loss in a landmark lawsuit against the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA). Earlier in March, Judge James Mellor ruled that Wright did not author the Bitcoin whitepaper, create Bitcoin, or develop its early software, debunking his longstanding claims to the contrary.
Now, Mellor has granted COPA's application for a worldwide freezing injunction to prevent Wright from dissipating assets and evading costs related to the case. The British…]]></summary>

You are responsible for your own funds, you are responsible for keeping them safe, you are responsible for everything.

Securing your Bitcoin can be thought of similarly to building a house. First, you have to lay a foundation, then you build a frame on top of that, from there you fill in the walls, insulation, utilities, etc. For each piece of the house you want to add, you need to have completed the previous piece properly or the entire house will be unsafe and unstable.

Will Bitcoin Register A New ATH?
 
Yusko’s bullish outlook hinges on a combination of factors. He cites Metcalfe’s law, a network effect model, to estimate the top crypto’s current “fair value” at $50,000.
 
The upcoming halving, which cuts miner rewards in half, is expected to disrupt supply dynamics and historically has been followed by price surges. However, Yusko acknowledges the emergence of transaction fees as a new wrinkle, potentially mitigating the immediate impact of the halving on miner profitability.

Grogan revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bankman-Fried, through Alameda Research, sold $75 million of staked ETH (stETH) in January 2022. This led to a massive depeg event, which triggered the bank run on bankrupt crypto lender Celsius. That was also the tail event that brought about the collapse of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).
