On Wednesday, January 10, the SEC approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously to provide a “level playing field” for the issuers.
 
Only One Will Win Bitcoin ETF War?
 
Many ETF issuers offered low fees to attract more investors to choose them over their competitors. Some of them, like Fidelity and Bitwise, even offer to waive their management fees for the first six months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved after months of speculation and waiting, bringing BTC to mainstream institutions for the first time. With BTC often considered digital Gold considering its finite supply, could the top cryptocurrency by market cap see a similar 360% post-ETF launch rally following in the footsteps of SPDR Gold Shares – the first gold-backed ETF launched in 2004?

At the moment, it still isn’t clear if the Bitcoin ETF approvals were a “sell the news event” or if it is a catalyst for further rally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has recently issued a statement that could have significant implications for the local crypto market in its region.
 
The FSC has indicated that domestic securities firms’ brokering of US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) might violate South Korea’s regulations concerning virtual assets and the Capital Markets Act.
 
This announcement came as a response to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, a decision the industry has long awaited.
 
 
South Korea’s Stance On Crypto
 
Notably, this FSC’s declaration on brokering US spot Bitcoin ETFs underscores the regulatory divergence between South Korea and the US in their approach to crypto ETFs.

Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin Advocates for Higher Gas Limit to Improve Network Capacity
 
Ethereum ecosystem co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed an increase in the network’s gas limit. This adjustment, aimed at augmenting network capacity, could potentially lower costs for users and enhance transaction efficiency.
 
Ethereum’s gas limit is the ceiling for the total amount of gas allowed in a single block. Gas, a fee necessary for conducting transactions or executing contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, ensures the network’s operational fluidity. Presently, the gas limit stands at 30 million.

Following the consistent burns, the total number of tokens burned has crossed a new milestone, touching a new all-time high.
 
More Than 12 Million XRP Burned
 
According to data from the XRPScan website, the total number of XRP coins that have been burned so far has crossed the 12 million mark. At current market prices, this means that the community has collectively sent over $6.8 million worth of tokens to the burn address.
 
 
However, while this figure may seem significant, it is quite small when compared to the maximum supply of the token. The XRP max supply is 100 billion, and with only 12 million tokens so far, it is barely making a dent …]]></summary>

What Is The Major Issue With Spot Bitcoin ETFs
 
Roberts raised concerns over Bitcoin’s limited supply in an X (formerly Twitter) post, something which he believes could be an issue with the Bitcoin ETFs. He noted how this class of ETFs happens to be the first with an underlying asset whose supply is capped at a particular amount. BTC’s maximum total supply is 21 million BTC, and no more can be mined after that.
