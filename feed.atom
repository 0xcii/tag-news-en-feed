        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BONK, a Solana meme token, recently went on a surge that saw it pushing weekly gains above 70% after community members voted in favor of a burn proposal. Recent market dynamics have seen the value of BONK, along with the majority of meme coins falling in April. BONK, in particular, witnessed a 70% plunge in trading volume earlier in the month, a direct consequence of the waning interest at the time.
 
However, the recent conclusion of the Bitcoin halving event has seen BONK surging in the past week. Interestingly, this surge was intensified after a recent announcement of BONK burns and a listing on Revolut.
