        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong's leading financial institution, HSBC, has made a significant move by allowing its customers to trade Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This development marks a notable shift in the stance of traditional banks towards bitcoin, as HSBC has previously been cautious in embracing it.
Reporting by CoinDesk highlighted that HSBC's decision to enable bitcoin ETF trading for its customers comes after several prior developments that saw other banks also allow such activity. Notably, Samsung Asset Management launched the Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prior to that, the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF launched on the same platform, receiving approximately $53 million in initial investments. 
The decision by HSBC to allow its customers to trade bitcoin ETFs comes amidst a surge of institutional interest in bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., potentially igniting a race between countries to attract capital with these products. 
The developments are also indicative of the evolving attitudes towards bitcoin among financial institutions. As traditional banks begin to embrace bitcoin, it signals a potential shift towards wider adoption and integration of bitcoin into the mainstream financial system. The merits of this are debatable, but on the surface, that appears to be what these moves signify.
ETFs are popular investment vehicles, and the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs would open up new opportunities for institutional investors to participate in the bitcoin market within a regulated framework. While this comes at the cost of many of the inherent properties that make bitcoin valuable, institutions prefer the rails of regulation and are more likely to be trusting of firms like BlackRock. There are, of course, exceptions to this such as MicroStrategy, a company that holds its own bitcoin.]]></summary>

Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Mean Has Spiked To High Values
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a correction may soon be coming for the cryptocurrency. The “exchange inflow mean” is an indicator that measures the mean amount of Bitcoin that’s currently being deposited into the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
This metric isn’t to be confused with the “exchange inflow,” which tells us the total amount of BTC going to these platforms. While the exchange inflow is useful, it may not provide an accurate picture of the trend being followed across the market, as only a few whales, who transfer huge amounts, can easily skew the metri…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-26T15:35:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin dropped by nearly 3% on Monday, as traders began to take profits following last week’s gains. Cryptocurrency largely consolidated to start the week, with the global market cap down 0.64% as of writing. Shiba inu was another coin to move lower today.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was in the red to start the week, as traders seemingly secured gains following a recent bull run.
 
DOGE/USD rose to a two-week high at $0.0704 last Thursday, however it has since gone on to record consecutive declines.
 
The latest drop pushed the meme coin to an intraday low of $0.06557, which is its weakest point since Saturday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s sell-off comes as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a support point at 50.70.
 
Since the decline, the index is now tracking at 48.55, with the next visible floor being at the 46.00 mark.
 
In the event that this level gets breached, there is a strong chance that DOGE will drop below $0.0640.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Another meme coin to fall lower on Monday was shiba inu (SHIB), which slipped following its own recent rally.
 
Following a high of $0.000007907 on Sunday, SHIB/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.000007684 in today’s session.
 
Like with dogecoin, shiba inu also captured a multi-week high last week, however, sentiment shifted after the RSI hit a hurdle.
 
 
Price strength failed to break out of a resistance level of 54.00, and as of writing is currently tracking at 50.43.
 
Despite this bearish signal, a potential upwards crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages is on the cusp of occurring.
 
Should this take place, it is likely that SHIB gains further in the upcoming week.

Kabir based his analysis on the head and shoulders (H&S) pattern. It indicated a strong bullish sentiment in the market, which could see BTC reaching the $34,000 target after the breakout from the channel.
