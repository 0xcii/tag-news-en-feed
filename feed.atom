While medicinal use of the plant had been allowed in California since 1996, and widespread acceptance slowly dominoed across the country over the next 20 years, Washington and Colorado were the first to allow legal recreational use at the state level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has now canceled its restrictions on banks and other financial institutions in operating accounts for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). This marks an exciting development as the Apex Bank looks to chart a new course for crypto regulations in a nation that has over 200 million people. 
 
 
CBN Introduces New Guidelines On VASPs Banking Operations
 
In a circular released on December 22, the CBN explained that its initial ban on banking operations by VASPs in February 2021 was based on the risks of money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) as well as the apparent lack of regulations and investor protection measures in Nigeria’s crypto industry.
