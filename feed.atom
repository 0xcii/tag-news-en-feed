After a decade of slumber, a Bitcoin wallet, presumed lost to the mists of internet history, stirred back to life on May 6th, 2024. This prehistoric beast, a “whale” in crypto terminology due to its massive holdings, sent ripples through the market by transferring a staggering 687 BTC, valued at nearly $44 million.
