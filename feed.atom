        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  has launched a new initiative targeted at hastening the registration process of virtual asset service providers (VASP).

Nigerian SEC Fixes 30-Day Deadline For VASP Registration
 
Back in March, the Nigerian SEC announced several changes to its Rules on Digital Assets Issuance, Offering Platforms, Exchange, and Custody. Notably, the commission then hiked the registration fees of VASPs from 30 million naira ($20,161) to 150 million ($100,806) which attracted much speculation because of the pote…]]></summary>

In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed the relevance of the Bitcoin hashrate to the asset’s price recovery. The “hashrate” refers to a measure of the total computing power the miners have currently connected to the network.
 
The trend in this metric can be viewed as a representation of the situation among these chain validators. When the indicator rises, it suggests that miners are finding the chain attractive to mine on right now.
 
 
On the other hand, a decline in the metric implies some miners have decided to disconnect from the network, potentially because they are currently find…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-1166/"/>
        <updated>2024-06-22T03:01:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a positive turn of events, the Shiba Inu burn rate has seen another notable spike. This time around, the activity, meaning the number of addresses participating in the burns, has seen a notable increase and the burned tokens have risen by over 1,100% in one day.
 
Shiba Inu 1,166% Spike In Burn Rate
 
According to Shibburn, the official website for tracking the total amount of SHIB tokens burned each day, the Shiba Inu burn rate has seen a 1,166% spike. This spike is significant as it shows an increased willingness among Shiba Inu investors to burn tokens.
 
 
In the 24-hour period, a total of 35.29 million tokens have been burned, which is a marked difference from the previous day’s figures. However, what might be more important is the number of burn transactions that have been recorded in the 24-hour timeframe.
 
Shibburn’s data shows that there has been a total of 12 burn transactions from holders in the last day. This is a welcome change from the average of six burn transactions that have been recorded over this week. Notable burns have also been recorded across a number of transactions instead of concentrated to just one or two transactions only.
 
For example, the highest burn transaction during this time was a wallet which sent a little over 10 million tokens to the burn address. Then there are seven transactions carrying between 2 million and 5.5 million tokens to the address. While the rest of the transactions were carrying much lower volumes.
 
This spike in the burn rate follows a positive trend that began this week. On June 18, Bitcoinist reported that the Shiba Inu burn rate had seen a 5,569% spike. This comes after a notable stretch of time with muted burn performances, making this a positive turn in the tide.
 
 
Elsewhere, more specifically, the daily trading volume, Shiba Inu is performing poorly compared to its burn rate. The daily volume is down 14.22% and sitting at $270 million. In the same vein, the price is seeing daily losses of 0.71% and down 15.17% in the last week.]]></summary>
