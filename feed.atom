        <updated>2023-03-29T18:11:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The global bitcoin exchange will dig into its own coffers to reconcile users who lost their money as a result of the collapse of Celsius.
Global peer-to-peer Bitcoin platform Paxful announced it will provide almost nine bitcoin worth ~$250,000.00 to its Paxful Earn users who were affected by the Celsius collapse. 
The funds will be transferred to Paxful wallets this week. Paxful Earn was launched in partnership with Celsius to offer Paxful users a chance to earn yield on their Bitcoin. However, users were unable to withdraw their funds from Celsius when the latter collapsed, leaving Paxful paralyzed and unable to retrieve the funds. Around 600,000 interest-bearing accounts, including Paxful Earn users, were affected when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn ruled that assets in Celsius Earn accounts belonged to Celsius’ bankruptcy estate, not to the users.
Ray Youssef, founder and CEO of Paxful, said, “The courts failed these Celsius users. The U.S. government is more than willing to bailout traditional banks, but Bitcoin users do not seem to be their priority. That does not sit right with me, and I have taken action to make sure Paxful Earn users receive their full Celsius funds.” 
Since the Celsius collapse, Paxful has been encouraging Bitcoin self-custody and advocating for users to hold their own Bitcoin. Paxful also supports financial literacy and transparency, having recently donated funds to build the Bitcoin Technology Center in Ghana to spread financial education.
Youssef stated that customer trust is hard to earn and even harder to keep, and he would always put Paxful’s users first. According to him, the company's primary focus is the customer and has launched various initiatives to support its customers. He cites the company’s involvement in charity and social impact work, such as providing funds to build a school in Rwanda and donating money to assist with pandemic relief efforts in India.]]></summary>

This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, a content creator and small business owner.
The events of the last few weeks have spooked investors and regional banks alike. More importantly, the people who go to work and make the economy run are starting to question whether their bank deposits are safe. Fears of more bank runs after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank, Silvergate Bank and Credit Suisse are rampant.
And these fears are not unfounded, if you ask me. For instance, when you turn on the TV and see that First Republic needs a $30 billion bailout to stay afloat, it doesn’t inspire confide…]]></summary>

In addition to targeting firms such as Kaspersky, Huawei, and Tiktok, opponents of the bill believe one of its provisions will punish ordinary Americans for leveraging a virtual private network (VPN). However, a spokesperson for Democratic senator Mark Warner insists the “legislation is aimed squarely at companies” and “not at individual users.”

        <updated>2023-03-29T17:16:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp climbed to its highest level since last May, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. The token rose by as much as 17% in Wednesday’s session, with the global market cap over 5% higher. Cardano also rallied, rising by over 11%.
 
XRP
 
XRP maintained its bull run on Wednesday, as prices rose by as much as 17% in today’s session.
 
Following a fall to a low of $0.4866 on Tuesday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.5804 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, XRP hit its strongest point since May 9, breaking out of a long-term ceiling at $0.5550 in the process.
 
 
The surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also broke free of a recent ceiling at the 70.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking marginally below yet another point of resistance, this time at the 75.00 mark.
 
Overall, earlier gains have somewhat diminished, as bulls appear to have secured profits, near this current point of uncertainty.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
In addition to XRP, Cardano (ADA) also rallied in today’s session, with the token climbing by nearly 11%.
 
ADA/USD moved to an intraday peak of $0.3894 earlier on Wednesday, following a low of $0.3511 the day prior.
 
This climb pushed cardano to its strongest point since February 23, when price hit a high of $0.3951.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s move appears to have come as the RSI broke out of a ceiling at the 58.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 59.75, with the next visible point of resistance at 63.00
 
Should this target be hit, there is a strong chance that ADA will be trading above $0.4000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A paper wallet is an early method used to protect bitcoin offline. Better methods have replaced it, but people still use paper wallets to store bitcoin safely and inexpensively.
What’s a Paper Wallet?
A paper wallet is a physical document or object that contains a brand new public address and a private key that has been printed out. It allows its users to store the bitcoin sent from another wallet for better safekeeping. Paper wallets are considered non-custodial cold storage because users control the private keys that can and should be printed out offline, thus removing the risks of exposing them to an internet connection’s hacks. 
There’s only one way for a malicious actor to get hold of your private key and steal your funds: physically getting control of your piece of paper where the pr…]]></summary>
