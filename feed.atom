In March, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, and ever since, it has consistently declined. This has sparked speculation about whether this marked the final peak of the bull market.
 
While many believed the March peak was a sign of the market topping out, a recent analysis suggests that this may have only been an “interim top.”
 
 
Is Bitcoin Set For Another Surge?
 
A CryptoQuant analyst named Sachi shared insights about Bitcoin topping out in March, revealing that based on on-chain data, the market is still far from its ultimate peak.
 
The analysis highlights the importance of long-term holder activity and the use of the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) indicator to gauge market maturity.

However, 2024 has been a rollercoaster year for SOL, marked by significant volatility and uncertainty.

As September unfolds, the big question is whether Solana (SOL) can make a comeback and possibly reach $150. However, analysts remain skeptical about its short-term prospects, especially when compared to the meteoric rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new meme coin that’s capturing the attention of the crypto community.
