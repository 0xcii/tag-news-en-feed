        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, bitcoin’s price soared past the $44,000 mark, peaking at $44,011 per unit. In the last month, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has seen a surge exceeding 24%, and 17% in just the past two weeks.
 
Bitcoin Breaks Through $44K Barrier, Reaching Peak Levels Since Pre-Terra Crash
 
This week, bitcoin has been on a remarkable ascent, escalating 14% against the U.S. dollar. On December 5, Tuesday, BTC achieved a zenith of $44,011 at 12:15 p.m. Eastern Time. Currently, BTC’s trading volume stands at $31.68 billion, a figure that is twice as high as the previous day’s. The trading range for bitcoin during the day fluctuated from $41,453 to a little over $44,000.

The value of BTC hasn’t reached these heights since April 6, 2022, before the Terra market collapse. Despite a trading volume of $31 billion, BTC’s dominant trading pairs are USDT, FDUSD, USD, USDC, and KRW. Today’s top exchanges for global BTC trading volume include major platforms like Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, and Bitfinex.
 
BTC’s trading volume on Tuesday ranks second, trailing only behind the stablecoin tether (USDT). The recent surge in crypto prices has led to the liquidation of $160 million in shorts over the last 24 hours. Of these, approximately $91.34 million originated from bitcoin (BTC) short positions. The ascendancy of this crypto asset has propelled its market dominance to 51.3% amidst a combined value of over $1.65 trillion across more than 10,000 assets.
 
 
Moreover, bitcoin has eclipsed the market capitalization of Meta, following its overtaking of Berkshire Hathaway’s total valuation. This latest price increase positions BTC as the ninth-largest asset in terms of market valuation, a list that includes companies, precious metals, and exchange-traded funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is soaring at this very moment, now above $43,000 and potentially aiming much higher with a spot ETF approval almost a certainty.
 
While an all-time high in USD terms is still more than $20,000 away, the top cryptocurrency by market cap is about to set a new record high against its arch-nemesis: the banking system.
 
Bitcoin Was Built To Win Against The Banking System
 
Bitcoin was born out of the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. Included in the Genesis block that started the Bitcoin blockchain is a headline from The Times speaking to bank bailouts at the time.
 
While central bankers print money at a whim and inflate the money supply, there will ever only be 21 million BTC. 15 years later, Satoshi’s invention is winning in the war against the traditional banking system.
 
 
Since the start of the year, there has been weakness in the banking sector due to economic distress, rising interest rates, and a flight of capital from regional banks. The weakness in banks and strength in Bitcoin recently could send BTC versus banks to new all-time highs.
 

 
 
BTCUSD Versus BKX Flirts With New All-Time Highs
 
Putting BTCUSD up against the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, representing the 24 largest “national money centers, regional banks and thrift institutions,” we can see that Bitcoin is poised to make new all-time highs.
 
While the dollar has been strong in 2022 and 2023, the banking sector has not, hence the discrepancy between BTC trading against the BKX and USD.
 
 
In the past, however, all-time highs in the BKX has translated into new record highs on the dollar trading pair, so the price action remains significant.
 
Bitcoin price is currently at $43,700 and climbing, making all-time highs about $25,000 away still. But with an ETF on the way, BTCUSD could catch up soon enough.]]></summary>

This could mean that there is a delayed rally coming for the altcoin and this could suggest a massive pump when this does happen. Analysts have identified key trends in the price of the meme coin, as well as a possible ‘god candle’ that could quickly double the price.
 
Dogecoin Enters Key Supply Zone
 
Crypto analyst MonoCoinSignal has taken to TradingView to show that the Dogecoin price has entered an important zone. The key supply zone has been identified just above $0.084 and the price has seen a decline after reaching this level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the recent surge in the cryptocurrency market, the BRC20 token ORDI has experienced substantial growth. This week, it reached a new milestone with its market capitalization surpassing the $1 billion threshold. The token’s value has soared by 676% in the past month and by 189% in just the last week alone.
 
ORDI Token’s Meteoric Rise
 
During this period of widespread gains in the crypto sector, ORDI, a BRC20 token and the first of its kind built on the Bitcoin network, has achieved a market valuation of $1 billion. As of the latest update, ORDI’s trading price stands at $59 to $61 per unit, marking a significant 189% increase in value against the U.S. dollar. The coin’s trading range for the day has fluctuated between $39.94 and $63, bringing its current market value to $1.22 billion.
 

 
With a current market valuation of $1.22 billion, ORDI now ranks 57th among the more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies in existence. In addition to its 676% rise over the past month, ORDI has skyrocketed by 1,851% from its all-time low of $2.86 per coin, recorded on September 11, 2023. Over the last 24 hours, ORDI has surged by 45% in value against the dollar, with a global trading volume reaching $945 million.
 
 
On December 5, 2023, ORDI stands out with the tenth-highest trading volume in the cryptocurrency market. The token has also been active in derivatives markets, especially in the last 24 hours. This surge in the BRC20 token’s price has resulted in a notable $12.70 million in short positions being liquidated. Notably, the Turkish lira has played a significant role in the trading volumes of ORDI, followed by tether (USDT). Other leading trading pairs with ORDI include BTC, TUSD, FDUSD, and USD.
