The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment that the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market share right now.
 
 
This index considers the data of five factors to determine this sentiment: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends.
 
To represent the sentiment, the indicator uses a scale that runs from zero to a hundred. All values below the 47 mark suggest the presence of fear among the investors, while those above 53 signify greed in the market.

 DOGE’s 30-day MVRV clocking in at -13%, the king of meme coins looks attractively priced for traders eyeing a fresh entry. This is because historically, ratios around this range have preceded rallies and served as the best buying zones.
