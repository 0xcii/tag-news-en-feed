Ethereum Total Transaction Count Continues To Go Down
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the ETH transaction count has observed a significant plunge recently. The “transaction count (total)” is an indicator that measures the total number of transfers taking place on the Ethereum blockchain on any given day.
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means traders are active on the network right now. On the other hand, low values imply the chain is seeing low activity at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) version of this indicator over the last couple of years:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin raced to a ten-day high to start the week, as markets returned from the Christmas holiday weekend. The token extended recent gains to start the week, and neared a key resistance point in the process. Xrp was also higher, as it also collided with a price ceiling.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was one of the notable gainers on Monday, as the token raced to a ten-day high.
 
LTC/USD rose to a high of $70.83 to start the week, which comes less than a day after hitting a low of $65.54.
 
Today’s surge has taken litecoin to its highest point since December 16, and closer to a key resistance level of $72.00.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, Monday’s move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose above its own ceiling at 45.00.
 
The index is currently tracking at 51.79, with the next visible point of support at the 54.00 level.
 
Should the RSI reach this point, it is highly likely that prices will also collide with a ceiling of $72.00.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, also moved higher to start the week, as the token collided with a key resistance point.
 
Following a low of $0.3447, XRP/USD hit a high of $0.356 earlier in today’s session, which is also a recent price ceiling.
 
Monday’s gain is the highest point that XRP has hit since December 18, and comes as traders returned from the Christmas holiday weekend.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this move accompanied a recent move beyond a ceiling on the RSI of 42.00.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 43.45, which is its strongest point since December 15.
 
Ultimately, should this trend continue, XRP could continue to move towards the $0.4000 mark.

His most recent advice to investors comes right on Christmas Day when the festivities have pulled the market into a lull.
 
Time To Sell Bitcoin
 
Taking to Twitter, Peter Schiff posted what he called his “Christmas gift” to bitcoin investors. The post followed the usual trend of bashing BTC, with a chart that he used to support his claim. The chart which shows the trend of the digital asset over the last six months pointed out that a support level had been turned into resistance.
