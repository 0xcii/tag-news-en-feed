        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meme coins have ballooned to new prices since the beginning of March, boosting blockchain activity in the process. This recent frenzy has seen Ethereum gas fees surging to two-year highs this week. 
 
IntoTheBlock, a leading on-chain analytics provider, announced this new milestone in a recent post on social media platform X. Data from ITB indicates that Ethereum mainnet’s revenue from network fees reached $193 million this week, pushing the annualized rate to the highest point since early 2022. 
 
 
Ethereum’s $190M+ in weekly fees puts it at an annualized rate of over $10B for the first time since early 2022. 
Due to Ethereum’s fee-burn mechanism, this also has an impact on the supply, decreasing it by 33k ETH (~$125M) this week. pic.twitter.com/iAibEvzh4j
