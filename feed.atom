Nerayoff’s new accusations focus heavily on what he describes as a covert partnership between government officials and Ethereum co-founders, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. He alleges that this coalition aimed to discredit him due to his insider knowledge of their activities. “It’s real and not a conspiracy,” he claims.
