Ripple Takes Over Asia
 
According to an official announcement, the payment company received authorization from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to provide full payment services in the country via a Major Payments Institution (MPI) license. The company was awarded an in-principle license to provide digital payment token services earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bybit announced on Oct. 2 that it will be offering its crypto derivatives products in South Africa through Money Doc which acts as the crypto exchange’s “juristic representative.” The crypto exchange said its on-ramp service enables South African users to make deposits in local currency via bank transfers. 
 
Bybit’s ‘Juristic Representative’
 
Bybit, the United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced on Oct. 2 that it had officially launched its crypto derivative products and a new fiat on-ramp service in South Africa. The crypto exchange said it will offer these services via its Money Doc (Proprietary) Limited, which acts as Bybit’s “juristic representative.”
 
In a statement, the crypto exchange revealed that Money Doc is an authorized financial services provider and a registered South African company. As reported by Bitcoin.com News almost a year ago, crypto asset service providers operating in South Africa must have a financial product service provider license from regulators.
 

 
Bybit meanwhile said its on-ramp service will enable users to deposit the rand currency (ZAR) via bank transfers. Commenting on the crypto exchange’s entry into the South African market, Joshua Yau, the regional manager for Africa, said:
 
“This marks a significant milestone for Bybit as we bring access to global leading products to the passionate crypto community in South Africa in line with regulatory requirements. This marks an important step in our compliance efforts. We are committed to providing a secure and seamless trading experience, industry-leading trading tools, and low-cost access that empower our users.”
 
Ben Zhou, the founder and CEO of Bybit, characterized the incursion into South Africa as the latest testimony of the crypto exchange’s commitment to its goal of making crypto trading accessible to all.

Pro-XRP Lawyer Deaton Gives Major Prediction
 
Deaton took to Twitter to express his thoughts on the SEC’s recent motion against Coinbase. He remarked that before the SEC filed its opposition to Coinbase’s motion to dismiss, he placed the odds of Coinbase winning at 40%. He added that this is an extraordinarily high percentage for victory on a motion to dismiss.” Deaton noted that, typically, the likelihood for victory in such motions wouldn’t exceed 10%.

In line with this, the court proceedings began with the voir dire process, with certain revelations made on the first day in court.
 
How Day 1 Of SBF’s Trial Went
 
In a live tweet of the proceedings, Inner City Press (which usually reports proceedings in the Southern District of New York) noted that Sam Bankman-Fried appeared to court in a “much shorter hair.” The FTX founder is known to have a signature curly hairstyle. However, he seems to have ditched it ahead of his trial.

Understanding Bitcoin Cash
Bitcoin  
Cash, often known as BCH, is a cryptocurrency that arose from a heated argument

predecessor, Bitcoin (BTC), in that it uses blockchain technology for safe and

cryptocurrency world is not without its pitfalls. While only a small fraction  
of crypto transactions are linked to illicit activities, the impact on  
individual investors can be devastating. A new study by Coin Kickoff  
sheds light on the most common types of Bitcoin scams, showing that blackmail  
leads the pack. The average value of BTC received by scammers in the first half  
of 2023 reached a whopping average of $1.66 million.
Crypto Numbers Tell a  
Story
In 2022, a  
mere 0.24% of all cryptocurrency transactions were associated with illegal  
activities. Although this percentage decreased from 1.9% in 2019, it still  
represents a significant $20.1 billion. The study also highlights that the
