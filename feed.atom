Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell sharply below a high above $25,000 on Friday, as crypto markets moved into consolidation.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $23,460.76 during today’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $25,134.12.
 
The sell-off seems to have occurred as a result of bitcoin bulls being unable to maintain a breakout of a ceiling at $24,200.

At the time of writing, SHIB is trading around $0.00001315, down 4% in the last 24 hours. The below chart shows the trend in the price of the meme coin over the past week.
