It is not surprising therefore that bitcoiners and ethereans should hold a long-standing rivalry. As the largest blockchain ecosystems, each running on distinct architecture and supporting distinct use cases, there are fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum.
These differences aren’t just technical but also cultural. Just as flora and fauna on Madagascar evolved differently from that on larger land masses, distinct crypto tribes form their own culture, memes, and ideology over time. Eventually, like Montagues and Capulets, they can’…]]></summary>

This decision has been a long time in the making and has been expected by all in the crypto community. As expected, the announcement turned out to be bullish for the market, driving a notable recovery in the prices of cryptocurrencies all across the space.
 
Bitcoin Bounces Toward $67,000
 
Over the weekend, the crypto market saw a market crash that sent the Bitcoin price back below $60,000. This development was brought about partly by the move from Iran toward Israel, with many anticipating that it would be the start of World War III.

This event is expected to have a major impact on the sector due to recent developments surrounding the leading digital asset. Some of these developments include the emergence of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the evolving regulations for digital assets.
How Bitcoin Halving Works
Bitcoin's deflationary model depends on the upcoming halving  
event, which occurs approximately every four years. This process reduces the block reward by half, limiting the supply of new tokens. With each halving, the number of Bitcoins in circulation becomes scarce.
The impending halving will reduce the block reward  
from 6.25 Bitcoins to 3.125 Bitcoins. Historically, halving events have led …]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-04-15T11:34:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong has reportedly approved its first spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with multiple issuers announcing they received permission to launch Bitcoin ETFs.
China Asset Management, Bosera Capital and other applicants posted on social media that they got clearance to list spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong. However, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has yet to release an official list of approved issuers.
According to the posts, the SFC greenlit China Asset Management to offer spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in partnership with OSL and BOCI International. Other approved issuers include Harvest Global Investments, HashKey Capital, and Bosera Asset Management.
The news mirrors the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which launched in January and quickly attracted over $200 billion in trading volume. Hong Kong's approval marks a milestone as Asia's first jurisdiction to embrace spot Bitcoin ETFs.
The ETFs provide exposure to actual Bitcoin rather than derivatives, offering investors direct access to the assets. They also present a regulated investment vehicle that mitigates some of Bitcoin's risks.
By approving the ETFs, Hong Kong cements its Bitcoin-friendly stance amid ongoing efforts to become a finance hub. The accessibly traded funds could stimulate significant retail and institutional demand.
However, an official SFC announcement remains pending. Some of the social media posts sharing the alleged approval have since been deleted. The opacity around permissions could contribute to market uncertainty in the near term.
Nonetheless, the reported approvals signal a willingness by Hong Kong's regulators to meet surging investor appetite for Bitcoin. The ETFs' launch will mark a major milestone for Bitcoin adoption and maturity in Asia.]]></summary>
