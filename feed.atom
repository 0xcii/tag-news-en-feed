Following the former US president’s guilty verdict on 34 felony charges, the market has shown a sharp reaction, highlighting the volatile nature of these niche financial assets. The MAGA coin, which uses the ticker TRUMP, lost a quarter of its value, plunging from $15 to $11 shortly after the verdict. Although it rebounded slightly to $14.50, the initial drop underscores the sensitivity of these assets to political events.
