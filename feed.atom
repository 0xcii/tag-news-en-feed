        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boerse Stuttgart Digital has received its final license from Germany's financial regulator BaFin to offer bitcoin trading and custody.
 
         
         
         
         
    
Boerse Stuttgart Digital, a subsidiary of the second largest stock exchange in Germany, has received the final license as a cryptocurrency custodian from Germany's financial regulator, BaFin. The license allows the exchange to provide institutional investors the ability to trade bitcoin on the platform as well as to act as a custodian. 
The exchange has been offering custody services through its Blocknox platform since January 2020, under a provisional license. With this new licensing, it will join the ranks of several major international firms officially entering into the bitcoin custodial and trading industry as of late. 
Fidelity opened their bitcoin trading platform to the public this month, allowing institutional investors the option to hold their bitcoin with them as well. In addition to that, Latin America’s largest e-commerce platform by market value, Mercado Libre, introduced bitcoin trading to their Chilean users, which was already available in Brazil. 
It should be noted that all of these platforms bear the risks associated with third-party custody of your bitcoin. The safest way to ensure your bitcoin is always accessible and always available is through self-custody, using a dedicated bitcoin wallet. Platforms like Boerse Stuttgart Digital and Fidelity have made bitcoin trading available to investors on these platforms, but do not necessarily further enable the true potential of bitcoin adoption.]]></summary>

Hash Rate On The Move
The Bitcoin network hash rate is on the move this year, now at an all-time high of 350 EH/s and up 36.7% YTD. Hash rate has been following the surge in price, which is the likely result of more machines coming online at a more profitable price point. In 2022, there was a lot of unused, newer inventory of ASICs that sat idle at lower bitc…]]></summary>

“It is not early. That boat has sailed. The only people who will get rich with bitcoin are those selling Bitcoin services,” Krüger added. This has sparked arguments and debates among the crypto community as many have disagreed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano moved to a six-week high on Friday, as consumer sentiment in the United States fell by more than expected. The University of Michigan’s monthly report fell to a reading of 62 in March, lower than the 63.2 sum markets were expecting. Chainlink also climbed, breaking out of a key resistance level. 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 

 
Cardano (ADA) surged to a six-week high in today’s session, as markets reacted to the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment report.
 

 
Sentiment in the United States fell to a reading of 62 in March, from a final sum of 67 the month prior.
 

 
ADA/USD surged to a peak of $0.4025 earlier in today’s session, following a low of $0.3709 on Thursday.
 

 

 

 
This move saw cardano climb to its strongest point since February 21, when the token reached a high of $0.4061.
 

 
Overall, the surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved beyond a ceiling at the 60.00 mark.
 

 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 63.67, which is close to a highest point of resistance at 64.00.
 

 

 
Chainlink (LINK)
 

 
Chainlink (LINK) rebounded from Thursday’s losses in today’s session, with the token climbing by as much as 5%
 

 
Following a low of $7.17 yesterday, LINK/USD raced to an intraday high of $7.65 on Friday.
 

 
As a result of the rally, chainlink once again moved above its long-term resistance at $7.55, hitting a one-week high in the process.
 

 

 

 
Looking at the chart, today’s breakout coincided with the RSI climbing past a ceiling of its own at 55.00
 

 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 57.54, which is marginally below a higher hurdle at the 58.00 point.
 

 
Should bulls move beyond this point, then there is a good chance that LINK will move towards $8.00.
