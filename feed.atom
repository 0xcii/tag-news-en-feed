In a statement, representatives from Banxico, the central bank of Mexico, stated the development of the currency was still in its initial stages, and there is still no date set for its launch.
Mexican CBDC Launch Date Still Not Determined
On Dec. 29, 2021, the Mexican government announced the development of its own digital peso via social media, which would be launched circa 2024. However, this timeline is becoming more and more unlikely to be fulfilled, according to new information coming from Banxico, the central bank of the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin, following the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, continues to struggle not only in terms of its trading price but also in its profitability.
 
It can be recalled that the company, back in November 2022, moved to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a U.S. county court, and collapsed in just a matter of days.
 
Bitcoin, being the main driving force of the crypto market, was greatly affected by this unfortunate development and eventually exited 2022 with a value that was significantly lesser than what it had back in 2021.
 
According to BTC data aggregator Statmuse, the maiden digital coin had an average price of $47,500 in 2021 but it closed last year with a median value of $28,171, losing 64.3% of its price for the year.
