However, Grayscale’s victory over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was no surprise to some crypto stakeholders as they foresaw the company’s victory over the SEC before anyone else did.
 
Crypto Stakeholders Predicted Grayscale’s Victory
 
Following the initial lawsuit from Grayscale against the SEC, Crypto Lawyer John Deaton was one of the earliest experts who predicted Grayscale’s victory over the SEC. 
 
 
Deaton’s predictions came in February 2023 following his X (formerly Twitter) post on February 28, 2023.

Crypto Liquidations Total At $170 Million During Past 24 Hours
 
On Tuesday, August 29, news broke out that Grayscale has emerged victorious against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its lawsuit. Bitcoin enthusiasts have long speculated that this victory could pave the way for a spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), so, it’s not surprising that the market has positively reacted to it.
 
Until Tuesday, BTC had been stuck in consolidation for quite a while, but with the news, the cryptocurrency finally escaped out of this sideways movement in spectacular fashion as its price shot up toward the $28,000 level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent report released on Tuesday, undisclosed sources detailed that the firm behind the top stablecoin in market cap, tether (USDT), is now banking with Britannia Bank & Trust. In the past month, tether’s supply has dipped by 1.3%, leaving 82.85 billion USDT in circulation.
 
Undisclosed Sources Say Tether Is Working With a Privately Held Bahamas-Based Bank
 
On August 29, Bloomberg journalists Yueqi Yang and Olga Kharif spotlighted Tether’s new partnership with the privately held Bahamas-based Britannia Bank & Trust for its banking services. The timeline of when Tether teamed up with Britannia remains hazy, but insiders revealed that the stablecoin giant is guiding its clientele to transfer funds to the bank’s Bahamian account number.
 
This revelation surfaces amidst challenges cryptocurrency firms face in clinching banking affiliations within the U.S., especially after the monumental downfall of three major U.S. banks last March – one of the most significant financial tremors in the nation’s history. Yang and Kharif shared that both Tether and Britannia declined to comment on the matter. Currently, tether boasts a market cap slightly surpassing $82 billion, with recent data highlighting a 1.3% drop in its reservoir.
 
 
In the latest 24-hour snapshot, USDT dominated the crypto trading scene, amassing an impressive $40.18 billion in global trade volume out of the $72.42 billion aggregate. This update is hot on the heels of Tether’s announcement to cease support for three blockchains: Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash, and Kusama.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum (ETH) stands poised to reign supreme in what analysts are calling the “upcoming stablecoin wars.” Bloomberg Intelligence crypto market analyst, Jamie Coutts, has confidently predicted the cryptocurrency’s victory, citing its expansive ecosystem and notable performance across crucial network-adoption metrics. 
 
Coutts, an authoritative voice in the crypto landscape, conveyed his insights on the matter through the social media platform X (formerly Twitter).
 
 
Ethereum Ecosystem Dominance And Layer-2 Progress
 
Ethereum’s strength lies not only in its intrinsic digital currency, Ether, but also in its dynamic ecosystem that nurtures innovation. Beyond the primary blockchain, the crypto’s landscape encompasses layer-2 projects such as Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP), which have pr…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-30T17:17:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC to 75% by the end of this year, and 95% by the end of 2024.
"The chances of the SEC approving spot Bitcoin ETFs this year have risen from 75% from 65% following Grayscale's court win, we believe, while the odds by the end of 2024 reach 95%," said the analysts. "The judges unanimously repudiated the SECs arguments, and the agency will struggle to justify further denials as it faces deadlines, negative PR and HashDex's novel approach." 
Yesterday, the DC Circuit court of appeals vacated the SEC's denial of Grayscale's $GBTC conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF. While this did not result in GBTC automatically being converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, this victory was a big step towards the approval of one in the future. 
 "The appeals court found the SEC to be arbitrary and capricious in its denial oder of GBTC's conversion into an ETF and vacated the decision," the analysts continued. "The written opinion from Judge Neomi Rao repudiated virtually every argument made by the SEC when comparing the Bitcoin spot and futures markets." 
A SEC decision on multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs is due by the end of this week, with many believing the applications will be further delayed as these so close to the Grayscale court outcome that just happened. Although, Balchunas said he's "not sure timelines will matter as much in this situation," and that what is more likely is that eventually the SEC will give in and approve an imminent launch.
