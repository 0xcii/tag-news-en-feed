The SEC had sought an asset freeze for Binance.US, a trading platform owned by Binance Holdings founder Changpeng Zhao, accused of allegedly mishandling customer funds, misleading investors and regulators, and breaking securities rules. 
 
Binance.US, fighting the SEC’s lawsuit and stating that customer assets are safe, argued that blocking the flow of all funds would cripple its business and hurt customers.

When crypto exchanges, stablecoins and banks are collapsing left and right, it looks suspiciously like we are already in the “suddenly” portion. And it is suddenly that currencies of the past have moved from the pocketbooks to the history books. 
Hyperinflation is a general increase in prices by 50% or more in a single month. Alternatively, sometimes economists and journalists use a lower rate of monthly inflation sustained over a year (but that still amounts to 100%, 500% or 1,000%). The imprecision leads to some confusion in what does or does not constitute a hyperinflation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the first pause in a historic series of interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, Bitcoin price appears unaffected, maintaining a steady price range between $25,000 and $28,000. 
 
Amid the market digesting the Fed’s interest rate decision, the leading cryptocurrency has so far exhibited a muted reaction to the central bank’s latest, less-hawkish move. But why?
 
Federal Reserve Puts Rate Hikes — And Bitcoin — On Pause
 
Minutes ago, the Federal Reserve, in a remarkable decision, held its key interest rate steady, temporarily halting what had been the sharpest flurry of rate hikes in four decades. While a pause was expected to provide some direction to the market, Bitcoin, currently trading at $25,800, has remained stable within its current price range.
 
 
In their fight against rampant inflation, Federal Reserve officials have hinted at the possibility of two more rate hikes later this year. This projection surpasses the expectations of many market analysts and economists.
 
Typically, such monetary policy adjustments by central banks have the potential to jolt global financial markets. Yet, the cryptocurrency’s muted response to the recent Federal Reserve actions remains noteworthy. Despite numerous potential catalysts for price fluctuations, the leading cryptocurrency is demonstrating a degree of price stability that belies its reputation for volatility.
 

 
 
Looking Ahead At The Fed’s Fight Against Inflation And Impact On Crypto
 
Looking ahead, the Fed’s continued effort to combat inflation through more rate hikes could introduce further variables into the crypto market landscape. As a potential yet thus unproven hedge against inflation, Bitcoin might yet see movement that bucks the trend.
 
 
Investors and observers will be watching closely as the year unfolds. The prevailing question is whether Bitcoin will maintain its current uncharacteristic stability, or whether the anticipated Federal Reserve actions will eventually trigger a more substantial response.]]></summary>

The pledge, totaling $1 million per year for the next five years, aims to support Brink's efforts in funding Bitcoin developers and ensuring the long-term sustainability of Bitcoin's core codebase.
Brink aims to provide fellowship and support to Bitcoin and Bitcoin-adjacent developers. The organization offers developer grants, mentorship programs and funding opportunities to promote open-source development for Bitcoin and related technologies. By nurturing new contributors and decentralizing Bitcoin's protocol development, Brink hopes to strengthen the Bitcoin network and developer ecosystem.
Expressing his gratitude for the generous pledge, Mike Schmidt said, "Brink is very grateful for this extended pledge to support our Bitcoin developer funding efforts. $1,000,000 a year for each of the next 5 years means that we can help make Bitcoin development a sustainable career for the talented developers that are building, securing, testing, and reviewing the Bitcoin Core codebase."
The support from #startsmall will contribute significantly to Brink's mission of supporting Bitcoin development and fostering open-source decentralized systems. This substantial funding injection will enable Brink to provide ongoing support to Bitcoin developers and facilitate their crucial work in maintaining and enhancing the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Brink is actively engaged in creating a sustainable environment for Bitcoin development. With the additional funding, they can attract more talent, further educate developers, and expand their fellowship and grant programs. This financial backing not only demonstrates the commitment of #startsmall to open-source initiatives but also highlights the growing importance of Bitcoin and its underlying technology.
