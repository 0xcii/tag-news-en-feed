Connect, a regulated digital asset custodian. This collaboration aims to enable

ensuring their assets are held in a regulated custody environment. 
Supported by Ledger Tradelink
According to Bitfinex, this partnership is made  
possible by Ledger Enterprise's off-exchange trading and settlement technology,  
Ledger Tradelink. This technology will allow Bitfinex's institutional customers to trade without frequently moving assets on-chain.
