        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-matic-rebound-on-tuesday-following-recent-lows/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-07T16:41:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp rose higher in Tuesday’s session, as prices continued to move away from a long-term support point. Overall, sentiment in cryptocurrencies remained largely bearish, with the global market cap down 0.34% as of writing. Polygon was also in the green at the time of writing. 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was a notable gainer on Tuesday, as the token continued to move away from a recent support point.
 
Following a low of $0.3648 to start the week, XRP/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.3751 earlier in the day.
 
The move resulted in XRP bouncing from a long-term price floor at $0.3650, following a recent four-day losing streak.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that this took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of its own ceiling at 43.00.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 43.97, with the next visible resistance point at 45.00.
 
Should this ceiling be hit, there is a strong chance that XRP will be trading at, or above, the $0.3800 mark.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) also rose higher in today’s session, a day after bulls rejected a breakout at a key price level.
 
MATIC/USD moved to a peak of $1.17 on Tuesday, which comes after a bottom at $1.12 the day prior.
 
As a result of this move, polygon bulls pushed prices further away from a recent floor at $1.10.
 
 
Overall, it appears that this rebound coincides with the RSI moving away from a recent floor at 39.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 41.17, with the nearest point of resistance being at the 45.00 mark.
 
Bulls could likely target this point, and should they reach it, MATIC could move above $1.20.

The increased growth and adoption of the crypto industry have led many countries to pursue Central Bank Digital Currencies. Three of the first countries to launch a CBDC were the Bahamas (Sand Dollars), China (digital Yuan, e-CNY)) and Nigeria (eNaira).
 
While other countries are in different stages of CBDC development, China has continued to pursue a wider adoption of e-CNY across its regions. The country has conducted many promotional activities, including gifting a certain amount to wallet owners and even dishing out lotteries in local communities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The funding will be used to expand the platform's retail Bitcoin on-ramp in Europe, add zero-fee trading, support for Lightning and more.
Relai, a Swiss non-custodial bitcoin platform, has announced a $4.5 million funding round led by Ego Death Capital. 
New investors include Timechain, Cabrit Capital and Lightning Ventures, while participating firms Redalpine and Fulgur Ventures are both previous investors.
In addition to this news, the company announced that Ego Death Capital general partner Andi Pitt will be joining Relai’s board. 
“The current bear market is the perfect time to focus on what’s most important: building a top-notch product, delivering a seamless user experience, and educating people about Bitcoin as the best savings technology ever invented,” said Relai CEO and co-founder Julian Liniger. “Our team is hungry for what’s ahead, and we have a crystal clear plan that we will execute in the coming months. With ego death capital and the great network around Jeff Booth, Andi Pitt, and Nico Lechuga, we are ready to bring bitcoin to everyone in Europe!“ 
The funding will go towards further expansion as a retail Bitcoin on-ramp in Europe. Relai currently has plans to add zero-fee trading, implement support for the Lightning Network and introduce a white-label product that will allow for other firms to offer fiat-to-bitcoin trading. Also in focus is the recently launched Relai Business platform. 
“We’ve been really impressed by Julian and the Relai team and their ability to deliver long term value to users,” commented Jeff Booth, general partner at ego death capital. “We believe they will be a key player for European Bitcoin adoption and are excited to work with them.”]]></summary>

Coinbase is one of the firms under the radar of financial watchdogs. On March 6, Coinbase CEO was interviewed on Bloomberg Radio to discuss the crypto industry issues and how his firm will navigate them.
 
The crypto industry has been facing two significant challenges recently: regulations and sell-off in coin prices. Many investors lost billions of dollars in 2022 due to the extended bearish market.
 
 
The falling prices resulted in the crash of many firms, such as the FTX crypto exchange. As a result, regulators stood up to push for stricter regulations to protect investors.
