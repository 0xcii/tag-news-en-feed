According to a recent social media post on X by Galaxy Digital’s Head of Research, Alex Thorn, Vice President Kamala Harris appears poised to continue, and even escalate, the Biden administration’s regulatory crackdown on the industry.
 
Anti-Crypto Figures As Advisors
 
Thorn’s analysis points to Harris’ choice of advisers as a concerning signal for the digital asset community. The vice president has reportedly brought on key anti-crypto figures from the current administration, including Brian Deese and Bharat Ramamurti, who are said to be “two key architects of the Biden admin’s anti-crypto crusade.”

cryptocurrency services in Hawaii. This marks the first time in seven years

Hawaii was the only state where Coinbase did not offer

Division of Financial Institutions has removed the requirement for a  
money-transmitter license, which was previously needed for digital asset
