PEPE Has Ended Its Recent Bullish Run With A Drawdown Of 15%
 
PEPE was having an excellent May as its price was on a steep upwards trajectory, but the asset has slipped up in these last few days of the month as it has gone through a drawdown.
 
 
The below chart shows how the memecoin’s performance has looked like over the past month.
 

 
 
PEPE had kicked off the month trading around $0.0000061 and by the start of this week, the cryptocurrency had nearly tripled its value as it breached the $0.0000170 mark.

Apparently, FLOKI’s price trend was similar to that of PEPE and he expects it to follow the same path.
 
 
In a follow-up post, the crypto analyst further reiterated their stance on the meme coin, believing it is starting to break out already. Blunts pointed out …]]></summary>
