Everyone celebrates the halving each cycle as a moment where Bitcoin becomes a more scarce asset, an event where historically the price has skyrocketed in reaction to the change in the issuance schedule and everyone waits with bated breath for history to repeat itself.

While the word “holiday” or Holy Day, literally means a day that is set apart, there are also examples of special occasions which extend beyond a 24 hour period such as Hanukkah, Ramadan or even the 12 days of Christmas.

Centralization Poses Existential Threat To Bitcoin
 
According to Stadelmann, a worrying trend of centralization within the Bitcoin network could threaten the cryptocurrency’s decentralized identity.
