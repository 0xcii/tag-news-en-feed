        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over time, as the value of Bitcoin has ballooned, crypto investors have turned to other alternatives for higher potential gains and altcoins have proven to be the answer. However, the problem comes in as there are thousands of altcoins in the market, making the process of picking the right promising altcoins a rather daunting feat. In light of this, a crypto analyst has provided a detailed list of 9 altcoins that could end up doing very well in the bull market.
 
Altcoins That Could Do A 100X
 
Like many, crypto analyst Linton Worm expects that the next crypto bull market will begin in October 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An XRP wallet which likely belongs to Chris Larsen, one of the largest holders of XRP, has made another notable transaction in what looks like a preparation for a selloff. The transaction, which took place within the last 48 hours, triggered a series of subsequent transfers in the past 24 hours, ultimately connecting with the crypto exchange Binance.
 
 
Notably, the transaction in question involved the movement of 20 million XRP tokens from a wallet linked to Chris Larsen into a private wallet linked with selloffs to Binance. 
 
Examining The Series Of Transactions
 
For context, one of the wallets belonging to Larsen, co-founder of payments technology company Ripple, transferred 50 million XRP into wallet “raorBm” on September 16, triggering reactions from XRP enthusiasts. This reaction …]]></summary>
