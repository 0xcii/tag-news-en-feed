Just a month ago, The New York Times published a malicious article on Bitcoin mining’s energy usage. Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts has repeatedly attacked Bitcoin from a variety of angles, going so far as to launch an “anti-crypto army” targeting Bitcoin as a hazard to consumers, all while misleading the public on the environmental impact of Bitcoin.
