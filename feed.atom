These include conservative think tanks, fossil fuel lobbyists, and climate change skeptics, casting a shadow on the Bitcoin community’s claims of moving towards sustainability.
 
Greenpeace’s investigation purports to reveal a web of relationships suggesting that, despite public claims of embracing renewable energy and reducing carbon footprints, the mining industry remains entangled with groups and individuals who have historically resisted efforts to combat cli…]]></summary>

The rationale is understandable: if criminals won’t be able to use their money, they will have to eventually stop whatever they are doing and go get a 9 to 5 job.
However, after 20 years of ever tighter (and ever more expensive) AML regulations, the levels of organized crime, tax evasion, or drug use do not show any signs of decrease. At the same time, the basic right to privacy is being unceremoniously violated on an everyday basis, with each financial operation, no matter how tiny, being subject to extensive verifications and tons of paperwork.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Talks about Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, have picked up steam ahead of his sentencing on March 28. The primary discussion has been the number of years the defendant could get, with his lawyers recently arguing that the prosecution’s proposed sentence of 50 years is unfair. 
 
Sam Bankman-Fried Getting 50 Years Is “Not Justice”
 
In a letter addressed to Judge Lewis Kaplan, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers criticized the government’s memorandum, in which they proposed that SBF be sentenced to 40 to 50 years. They further mentioned that the prosecution is adopting a “medieval view of punishment to reach what amounts to a death-in-prison sentencing recommendation.”
