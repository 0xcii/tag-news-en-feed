        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent development, the bankrupt FTX crypto exchange has announced a draft creditor-repayment plan as part of its ongoing bankruptcy restructuring procedure. The freshly revamped exchange intends on clearing out its digital token FTT while settling customer claims in cash.  
 
A Look At The Plan
 
The draft creditor-repayment plan is a product of feedback from the platform’s stakeholders. According to the plan, FTX intends to value every customer claim in USD as of the date of bankruptcy. 
 
Court documents show that the restructuring plan will see FTX repaying creditors by selling off assets tied to different silos of the business. Additionally, the platform has not completely dismissed the option of rebooting its offshore exchanges.

The BALD memecoin, humorously named after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, launched on July 30 and took off on an unbelievable 290,000% gain within its first 24 hours. However, it wasn’t long before the euphoria turned sour as the anonymous deployer of BALD withdrew 10,705 ETH ($20 million) and 224.6 million BALD from liquidity, causing the token’s price to plummet by over 90%. Despite allegations of a ‘rug pull’, the deployer denied these accusations.
