        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have any semblance of interest in cryptocurrency trading, you should’ve already heard that the Ethereum ETF approval by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is well on its way. Cryptocurrency investors are about to get the opportunity to buy into some brand new exchnage-listed products in the coming days or weeks, pending final confirmation from the regulator.
The long-held opposition on part of the chief US financial regulator and its Chair Gary Gensler to the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap receiving a dedicated ETF listed on US exchanges, has been largely overcome, and not without political pressure.
Coinciding with the passing of a key cryptocurrency-related bill by the U.S. House of Representatives, called FIT 21 on Wednesday, the Ethereum ETF approval could…]]></summary>

Until the start of this week, the overwhelming expectation was that ETH ETFs were in line for rejection, amid reports that the SEC had not engaged with applicants, and with uncertainty around how ETH was categorized: as a commodity, like BTC, or as a security that was not properly registered.
