And while most individuals on the list would be proud, CZ appears to have been taken aback by the figures, and slammed Bloomberg for its alleged false narrative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current indicators suggest the European Central Bank (ECB) should raise the interest rate in May, the monetary authority’s chief economist said. Future increases will depend on the economic data but this is still not the right time to stop, according to Philip Lane who believes the bank has to bring inflation back to the 2% target “in a timely manner.”
 
Leaving Interest Rate at Current Level Would Be ‘Inappropriate’ Despite Falling Inflation, Lane Says
 
Inflation in the euro area has dropped significantly between October, when it peaked at 10.6%, and March’s 6.9%. Nevertheless, the most important goal for its central bank is to make sure that it gets closer to 2%, Chief Economist of the ECB Philip Lane told Le Monde in a recent interview published by the bank on Tuesday.

According to the reports, the guidelines will address various matters regarding trading, custody, and issuance of digital assets. The announcement comes as Hong Kong seeks to position itself as a leading hub for the cryptocurrency industry in Asia. 
 
While it has been home to several cryptocurrency exchanges and related businesses in recent years, the lack of clear regulations has made it difficult for these companies to operate with certainty.

According to Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, Bitcoin could benefit from recent turmoil in the banking sector, a stabilization of risk assets as the US Federal Reserve ends its interest rate-hiking cycle, and improved profitability of crypto mining.
 
While the cryptocurrency’s original goal of serving as a hedge against skyrocketing inflation last year was unsuccessful, it recently achieved success by serving as a wager against the traditional banking system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
