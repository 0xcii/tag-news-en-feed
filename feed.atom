India to adhere to regulatory compliance and enhanced security, 99 Bitcoins

Alternative Payment Methods
The crypto exchange assured users in the region that alternative  
payment methods like bank transfers and digital wallets remain available.  
Despite mixed reactions from industry experts, concerns linger

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate has significantly declined to begin the new week. The drop in the number of Shiba Inu tokens burned continues to be an issue for the meme coin’s ecosystem, and certain factors contribute to this decline. 
 
SHIB’s Burn Rate Declines By 97%
 
Data from the burn tracking website Shibburn shows that Shiba Inu’s burn rate has declined by over 97% in the last 24 hours, with only 128,791 SHIB tokens burned during this period. These burns occurred in just two transactions, with 100,000 Shiba Inu tokens burned in one transaction and 28,791 burned in the second transaction. 
 
 
This is in stark contrast to the day before when over 4.5 million SHIB tokens were burned. However, the bigger picture shows that Shiba Inu’s burn rate has been on the decline for a while now.…]]></summary>

In his analysis, Peter Brandt suggests Bitcoin could gallop towards a record-breaking peak of $130,000 to $150,000 by late summer 2025.
 
Brandt’s forecast hinges on a historical phenomenon known as the Bitcoin halving. Every four years, the number of Bitcoins awarded to miners gets cut in half, restricting supply and theoretically pushing prices upwards.
 
25% Chance Bitcoin Has Already Hit Its Peak
 
But Brandt examines deeper – he argues that past halving dates have coincided roughly with the midpoint of bull market cycles. With the most recent halving happening in April 2024, his analysis suggests a peak 16-18 months later, landing us squarely in t…]]></summary>
