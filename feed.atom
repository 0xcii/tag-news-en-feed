        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it really surprising, given that cats have essentially dominated the internet for the last two decades, that cat memes have finally taken over the Bitcoin space as well in the last few weeks? Cats are the most viral meme on the internet, so it's not shocking in the least bit that the Taproot Wizards have leaned into it, reinforced by the trolling Luke over his “dietary choices.” 
The question has to be asked though, are meme campaigns really how we want to go about deciding and discussing consensus changes to a protocol as valuable as Bitcoin? I’ve seen numerous music videos, campaigns to go out in the world and “educate” people on OP_CAT, and the whole “Quest” system that Taproot Wizards has launched taking place…but the reality is the vast majority of this content that I have seen has…]]></summary>

An XRP ETF Isn’t Feasible Until This Happens
 
Sharing his opinion with Cointelegraph, CoinShares’ head of product, Townsend Lansing has mentioned that an XRP ETF was unlikely until the SEC agreed that XRP wasn’t a security. Van Buren Capital general partner Scott Johnsson also told the media outlet that the likelihood of the Commission approving this kind of fund was “very slim.”

The transition from Fiat Standards to the Bitcoin Standard, though highly desirable, is not inevitable or necessarily imminent. The timing and occurrence of these changes hinge on the adoption choices made by individuals, organizations, and public entities.

The collective will, formed by the intentions of a critical mass with sufficient capital and agency, plays a crucial role in displacing central banks and the entrenched power structures in favor of a new system centered around Bitcoin.
