        <updated>2023-08-08T13:02:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded on Tuesday, following the news that Paypal was launching a USD stablecoin on the ethereum blockchain. The company hopes the move will bridge the gap between fiat and cryptocurrencies for all of its stakeholders. Ethereum was marginally higher today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was back in the green on Tuesday, as the cryptocurrency made marginal gains during today’s session.
 
The move came as Paypal announced its USD stablecoin, which will be hosted on the ethereum blockchain.
 
Following the news, CEO Dan Schulman said: “Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through Paypal USD.”
 
 
BTC/USD rose to a peak of $29,402.65 on the news, following a low of $28,724.14 the day prior.
 
Today’s peak sees bitcoin trade at its highest point since last Wednesday, when it was last above $30,000.
 
Tuesday’s rally has also brought the 10-day (red) moving average to the cusp of an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rose marginally after the Paypal news, with price moving away from a recent support point.
 
Following a low of $1,804.72 to start the week, ETH/USD jumped to an intraday high of $1,836.06 on Tuesday.
 
Despite the slight rise in price, ethereum continues to trade below a recent resistance level of $1,850.
 
 
A positive for bulls, however, comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of its ceiling at the 43.00 mark.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at a reading of 43.88, with the next resistance zone near the 50.00 point.
 
In the event this target is reached, ETH will likely be back above $1,900.

During this operation, law enforcement officials seized documents and equipment from the facility. The purpose of this action is to investigate the data collected by the cryptocurrency initiative.
 
 
Worldcoin, operating under the auspices of Tools for Humanity, had previously encountered a suspension of operations by the Kenyan government because of security concerns, according to reports. This suspension was initiated by Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki.

Recently, Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, successfully implemented Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to enhance the speed and scalability of Bitcoin transactions on its platform. This came after it was forced to halt bitcoin withdrawals for several hours in May 2023 due to a sudden surge in transaction volume, which led to an increase in processing fees.
This integration for Binance marked a significant milestone, as it prompted introductions and deepening talks about the Lightning Network as a long-term solution for managing substantial transaction volumes in the future.

This may come as a surprise to many, considering that Circle and its USDC token have been thought to majorly be focused on the US market, especially considering its close ties with Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US.
 
Non-US Markets Driving Adoption
 
Allaire revealed in his tweet that non-US markets are, in fact, the ones driving USDC’s adoption. 
 
 
According to him: 
 

Despite the hype that we’re all about the US, we estimate that 70% of USDC adoption is non-US, and some of the fastest growing areas are emerging and developing markets.  Strong progress happening across Asia, LATAM and Africa.  Demand for safe, transparent digital dollars is strong.
