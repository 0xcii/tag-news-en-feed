Iran’s retaliatory drone and missile attack on Israel, following the bombing of the Iranian embassy in Syria, sparked fears of further conflict in the region. As a result, investors flocked to safe-haven assets, including cryptocurrencies, seeking refuge from the uncertainty.
 
 
Amidst the chaos, Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, initially saw a surge in dominance as investors sought its perceived safety. However, this uptick was short-lived as the crypto’s dominance unexpectedly plummeted, raising questions about the cryptocurrency’s resilience in times of geopolitical turmoil.
