        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A digital Lazarus has risen from the blockchain graveyard. After a decade of slumber, a Bitcoin wallet, presumed lost to the mists of internet history, stirred back to life on May 6th, 2024. This prehistoric beast, a “whale” in crypto terminology due to its massive holdings, sent ripples through the market by transferring a staggering 687 BTC, valued at nearly $44 million.

The now-famous wallet first received its Bitcoin haul in January 2014, a time when the fledgling cryptocurrency was still finding its footing.
