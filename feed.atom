        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/seis-rocky-start-new-l1-crypto-token-dives-65-in-3-days-amid-market-turmoil/"/>
        <updated>2023-08-18T20:11:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The newly listed cryptocurrency SEI took a substantial hit after its debut, plummeting over 65% from its peak value in just three days. The coin’s latest 13% tumble mirrored a decline in the broader crypto market in the last 24 hours. 
 
New L1 Token Plummets 65% From Record High
 
Enter SEI, the latest entrant in the L1 blockchain realm tailored for trading. By Friday, this newly launched token hovered between $0.15 and $0.184 apiece. Touted by the team as one of the swiftest L1 networks, SEI claims a transaction finality of a mere half-second, processing 20,000 orders per second.
 
SEI’s documentation highlights its distinctive “Twin-turbo consensus”, designed for optimal efficiency. Developers note that SEI is among the few chains that adopt market-based parallelization. Moreover, SEI’s network offers an in-built exchange matching engine and protection against frontrunning, addressing common vulnerabilities in rival ecosystems. So far, however, SEI’s market performance has been lackluster.
 
 
Although SEI has been in the trading game for a scant three days, it’s already plunged 65.71% from its record high on August 16, 2023. Touching $0.15 on Friday marked its lowest valuation yet. With a market cap hovering around $279.51 million, SEI occupies the 115th slot among over 10,000 crypto assets, joining the ranks of other hyped L1 debuts like aptos (APT) and sui (SUI).
 
 
APT, holding the 38th rank among the 10,000+ coins, has descended 71.07% from its zenith on January 26, 2023. Yet, it rose 87.13% from its lowest point on December 29, 2022. On the other hand, SUI, another newly launched L1 contender, has fallen 78.10% from its top price reached on May 03, 2023, hitting its lowest value on August 17, 2023.

Bitcoin Supply In Profit Has Dropped From 71% To 61% After The Crash
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the supply in profit has taken a big hit with this price plunge due to the market previously being “top-heavy.”
 
The “percent supply in profit” here is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that’s currently carrying some amount of unrealized loss.
 
The metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous selling price for any coin was less than the current spot price of the asset, then that particular coin is said to be carry…]]></summary>

The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) had accused the mixer one year ago of money laundering. 
 
According to the agency, Tornado Cash has laundered over $7 billion of crypto assets since its launch in 2019. As a result, OFAC sanctioned the crypto mixer’s wallets and other smart contracts related to its operations. 
 
However, many top shots in the industry stated that the US Treasury Department went beyond its authority in the sanction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the first time in months, the entire list of top ten stablecoin assets has experienced supply shrinkage in the last 30 days. The stablecoin market now stands at $124 billion, following notable reductions across several projects. Yet, stablecoins still dominate in terms of global trade volume, accounting for 61% of all settled trades in the past day.
 
Top 10 Stablecoin Supplies Drop Lower in 30 Days; FDUSD’s Supply Jumps 23% Higher
 
Each of the ten premier stablecoins by market value has observed a decrease in supply. Notably, tether (USDT) experienced a 1.3% dip in its circulation over the recent month. USDC’s supply has diminished by 3%, and Makerdao’s DAI took a 7.6% hit.
 
The Paxos-backed BUSD now hovers slightly above 3 billion, shedding 15.7% of its circulating supply since the same period last month. Meanwhile, trueusd (TUSD) and Frax’s FRAX supply lessened by 1% and a whopping 19.8%, respectively.
 
Both USDD and USDP underwent reductions ranging from 1.2% to 10.1%. Concurrently, gemini dollar (GUSD) saw a sharp 36% drop this month, while liquity usd (LUSD) decreased by 1.4% in a month.
 
In contrast, the freshly introduced stablecoin, FDUSD, has expanded its supply significantly. On August 3, 2023, Bitcoin.com News highlighted FDUSD’s supply at 232 million, and now it’s around 287 million.
 
 
This indicates that in the last 15 days, FDUSD’s supply surged by 23.7%, even as most of the top ten stablecoins faced significant withdrawals. Binance wallets predominantly hold FDUSD’s supply, with only 26 distinct holders as of August 18, 2023.
 
With 61% of today’s trades associated with stablecoins, the total value reaches $74.26 billion at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on this Friday. Out of this, tether (USDT) represents a staggering $52.73 billion, translating to 71% of the global stablecoin trade volume for the day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin was one of the notable movers during Friday’s crypto blood bath, as markets reacted to speculation that Spacex had sold over $370 million in bitcoin. Today’s sell-off saw the global market cap fall by roughly 6.20%, at the time of writing. XRP also fell significantly.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) fell by as much as 15% on Friday, as a red wave washed over the cryptocurrency market.
 
LTC/USD fell to a low of $61.76 late on Thursday, which came following a high of $74.73 earlier in the day.
 
This decline pushed LTC to its lowest point since December 19, when price traded to a low of $61.00.
 
 
As a result of this sell-off, the relative strength index (RSI) fell below the 30.00 level, which means price is oversold.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 18.21, which is its weakest point since November 2018.
 
The price has since moved away from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $64.80.
 
 
XRP
 
Additionally, XRP, formerly ripple, also had significant declines on Friday, falling to a multi-month low of its own.
 
After climbing to a high of $0.5852 on Thursday, XRP/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.4681 later in the session.
 
The move saw XRP dive to its weakest point since May 16, when the price traded around the $0.4300 region.
 
 
This drop saw the token marginally break out of a key support point at $0.4600, wiping out all gains accrued following the ripple ruling.
 
Like with bitcoin above, price strength is now oversold, which prompted bulls to reenter, pushing XRP slightly higher.
 
As of writing, the token is trading at $0.5087.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bears ran through crypto markets on Friday, following reports that Elon Musk’s Spacex had sold all of its bitcoin holdings. It has been suggested that Spacex liquidated over $370 million worth of the cryptocurrency last year. Ethereum dropped below $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) bears pushed the cryptocurrency to a two-month low on Friday, following news that Spacex had liquidated all of its holdings BTC.
 
After peaking at $28,525.11 during Thursday’s session, BTC/USD plunged to a bottom at $25,409.11 late last night.
 
This was the weakest point that bitcoin had fallen to since June 16, when price was near a breakout below $25,000.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that the sell-off came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell deep into oversold territory.
 
The index is now tracking at 20.10, which is the lowest level it has hit since January 2022, which ironically was when Tesla began to sell off its own holdings in bitcoin.
 
Price has somewhat rebounded from earlier lows, and is now trading at $26,341.67.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also moved significantly lower following the news, slipping below $1,600 in the process.
 
ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,551.71 on Friday, down nearly $200.00 from Thursday’s peak.
 
This is the weakest reading for ethereum since March 12, when price was trading below the $1,459 level.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Like with BTC above, today’s sell-off has moved the RSI into a bear zone, with a current reading of 21.30.
 
This could work in the favor of bulls looking to buy the dip, and to a degree already has, with ETH now trading at $1,678.05.
