According to a letter filed in federal court in Manhattan, these witnesses would testify on campaign finance laws, valuations of FTX and its affiliate Alameda Research, and the crypto exchange’s software infrastructure and terms of service.
 
The move sheds light on Bankman-Fried’s defense strategy as he faces allegations of orchestrating a multibillion-dollar fraud.

This was the first SEC decision deadline in the listing process for these applicants since filing, with the delays pushing these applications back another 45 days. The next bulk of deadlines are being slated for the middle of October.

Earlier this week, Grayscale won its lawsuit with the SEC, resulting in the DC Circuit court of appeals vacating the SEC's denial of Grayscale's $GBTC conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF. This means it will be sent back to the SEC, in which now the commission has 45 days to appeal and file for an en banc hearing, if they wish to do so. 
While this victory in court does not mean GBTC is automatically being converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, this ruling does help bring us one step closer to one being approved by the SEC. Because the U.S. court of appeals shot down the SEC's reasonings for denying Grayscale's application, stating, "The Commission neither disputed Grayscale's evidence that the spot and future markets for bitcoin are 99.9% correlated, nor suggested that market inefficiencies or other factors would undermine the correlation...The Commission’s unexplained discounting of the obvious financial and mathematical relationship between the spot and futures markets falls short of the standard for reasoned decision making."
Yesterday, Bloomberg analysts Seyffart and Balchunas upped their approval odds by the SEC for a spot Bitcoin ETF to 75% by the end of this year, and to 95% by the end of 2024.

Nexo Unveils Dual Mode Card Capabilities to Streamline Crypto Payments
 
Nexo‘s new feature enables real-time toggling between modes within the Nexo app, providing flexibility based on users’ budgets and purchase needs, according to the company’s announcement on Thursday. Nexo said the newly launched service enhances the capabilities of its cryptocurrency card.
 
“The Nexo Card embodies the pinnacle of customer-centric innovation, cultivated from user-driven needs that Nexo has been diligently addressing over the years,” Nexo co-founder and managing partner Antoni Trenchev told Bitcoin.com News. “By bringing the pioneering Nexo Card with the Dual Mode capability to market, Nexo has further strengthened its position as a leading innovator in the crypto space,” Trenchev added.
 
First introduced in 2022, the Nexo card was developed with Mastercard and Dipocket. With Dual Mode, the Mastercard offers different functions based on the user’s needs, according to Nexo. The company’s announcement further details that users can earn interest on their balance and make free ATM withdrawals up to €10,000 per month.
 
Crypto debit cards first emerged around 2016, with early providers like Wirex and Bitpay issuing Visa and Mastercard-brand products. Their popularity has grown as cryptocurrencies have become more mainstream. Over the years, these cards have provided a convenient way to utilize crypto for daily purchases without having to cash out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by global trade volume, Binance, has announced it is discontinuing support for the stablecoin asset BUSD. The trading platform is encouraging users to swap their BUSD as Binance gradually phases out BUSD markets.
 
BUSD Support Ending on Binance, Users Told to Swap Tokens
 

 
On August 31, Binance disclosed BUSD support will be phased out and the exchange is asking users to convert BUSD to other stablecoins before February 2024. The blog post notes the issuer of BUSD, Paxos, has halted minting the stablecoin and Binance is offering no-fee swaps if customers convert BUSD balances into FDUSD.
 

 
On Sept. 7, Binance will suspend BUSD loans on cross margins and on Oct. 19, cross-margin and portfolio margin users will no longer be able to transfer additional BUSD as new collateral to the platform’s cross-margin wallet. “Withdrawals of Binance-Peg BUSD tokens via BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Tron, and Optimism networks will cease [on September 7],” the exchange disclosed.
 

 
Other suspension announcements say support will continue “until further announcements.” Several other phase-out BUSD dates are listed for Binance’s loan and earn programs. BUSD has seen its supply gradually decline since Paxos was told by U.S. regulators it could no longer mint BUSD.
 

 

 

 
The stablecoin’s market valuation is just above the $3 billion range, while there’s 327 million FDUSD in circulation today. Binance’s announcement notes that while BUSD is being discontinued, the exchange assures that “BUSD will always be backed 1:1 by USD.”
 

 
Meanwhile, Binance commands a majority of the TUSD supply according to Nansen analytics which shows the exchange’s TUSD stash represents more than 5% of its reserves. Binance further controls more than $17 billion worth of tether (USDT).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase has listed Paypal’s PYUSD stablecoin, following an announcement of its support for the digital asset just a day earlier. Should liquidity requirements be satisfied, the exchange plans to introduce trading pairs for the asset in stages.
 
Coinbase Adds PYUSD Stablecoin
 
Coinbase, the prominent cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in San Francisco, has incorporated Paypal’s dollar-tied token, PYUSD, into its offerings. The firm broke the news on Wednesday, mentioning that trading would commence at 9 a.m. PT on Thursday, provided “liquidity conditions were met.”
 
“Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our PYUSD-USD trading pairs will launch in phases,” elaborated Coinbase. “Support for PYUSD may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions.” The exchange also emphasized that PYUSD operates as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network, cautioning users against transferring the asset through alternate networks to avoid potential losses.
 

 
According to a recent Bitcoin.com News report, PYUSD’s supply experienced a spike leaping from 26.9 million to 43.3 million PYUSD. However, despite the recent addition to Coinbase, PYUSD’s activity remains limited, recording merely 1,587 transfers and boasting 388 holders. As of 12:30 p.m. ET on August 31, the exchange’s web portal says PYUSD can be acquired via Coinbase.
 
Our report on PYUSD highlighted that other digital currency platforms, such as Crypto.com, Uniswap, Gate.io, Bitmart, and Bybit, also support the token. On Thursday specifically, a labeled Coinbase wallet possesses around 1,005,467 PYUSD, ranking it as the fifth-largest PYUSD wallet as of August 31. This means the Coinbase wallet accounts for approximately 2.3221% of the total supply of Paypal’s stablecoin token.
