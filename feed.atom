Bitcoin And Ethereum Are Being Dumped
 
In a post shared by Santiment on Twitter, the on-chain data aggregator revealed that there was massive profit-taking happening across the two largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Given that both assets have seen massive gains since January began, this is understandable as investors would want to take profit off the top of their investments, but it could also spell bearish sentiment for them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monero rebounded from recent losses on Tuesday, as the token attempted to recapture recent highs. The move comes as U.S. markets reopened following a public holiday on Monday. Polkadot also moved higher in today’s session, snapping a two-day losing streak.
 
Monero (XMR)
 
Monero (XMR) rebounded on Tuesday, as the token moved back towards a recent seven-month high.
 
Following a low of $165.77, XMR/USD raced to an intraday peak of $173.28 earlier in today’s session.
 
Today’s move saw monero bounce from its support at $165.00, and climb towards a resistance of $175.00.
 
 
As of writing, the token remains below this ceiling, currently trading at the $172.65 level.
 
Should this hurdle be overcome, XMR bulls will likely attempt to recapture last week’s peak of $187.20.
 
In order for this to happen, the relative strength index (RSI), which is currently tracking at 68.71, will need to move back towards the 80.00 mark.
 
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) snapped a two-day losing streak on Tuesday, with prices nearing a two-month high.
 
DOT/USD hit a high of $6.07 earlier in today’s session, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $5.66.
 
As a result of Tuesday’s surge, DOT moved to a ceiling at $6.10, and closer to Saturday’s high of $6.51.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rebound came as the 14-day RSI also bounced from its own support point at 72.45.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 74.88, with a ceiling at the 82.00 mark a possible target for buyers.
 
As of writing, DOT has given up earlier gains, and is trading at $5.97.

        <updated>2023-01-17T16:11:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The site furthers the company’s goals of providing mining hosting services to a retail audience using sustainable power sources.
Sazmining, a bitcoin mining hosting solution provider, has launched their first hydroelectric-powered mining facility in Wisconsin, providing the company with a carbon-neutral source of electricity.

According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the facility will house 350 mining rigs. These will be powered by the natural flow of a nearby river running through a man-made dam.
The release describes how “This is a definitive proof-of-concept to show that, when done responsibly, bitcoin mining can not only greatly minimize any potential impact on the environment, but can also be fully carbon-neutral.” Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact has come under fire from many critics, but there is an incredible volume of research that shows Bitcoin mining encourages investment into renewables and sustainable sources of energy. 

Will Szamosszegi, CEO of Sazmining, stated that "Our new facility provides a carbon-neutral source of electricity for our mining operations and is a model for how mining can be managed sustainably as well as a testament to our commitment to make a positive impact on our environment and the economy.”
Sazmining has focused particularly on catering to the retail market. With Bitcoin mining being relatively complicated at scale, it can make sense for certain investors to seek out services like Sazmining’s in order to acquire a stake in the mining industry. 
"We want retail users to have the same opportunity to become full-time bitcoin miners as the big institutional players in the space,” President and COO Kent Halliburton said. “Scaling our services around earning revenue from mining alone incentivizes everyone equally, making joining the Bitcoin revolution simple and profitable.”]]></summary>
