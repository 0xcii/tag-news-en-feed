        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (the “Trust”) officially launched on Wednesday after receiving approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), emerging as a lower-cost alternative to the renowned Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).
 
New Bitcoin Mini Trust Debuts
 
According to Bloomberg, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, which debuted with a 0.15% expense ratio, is the lowest-cost exchange-traded product holding Bitcoin in the US market, edging out even the recently launched Bitcoin ETFs from industry giants like BlackRock and Fidelity.
 
The new mini-trust is being seeded with 10% of the assets from Grayscale’s largest fund the GBTC, which converted to an ETF structure in January 2023 after over a decade as a closed-end investment product.

In the report, Pantera disclosed that women in the cryptocurrency industry earn significantly more than their male counterparts. This discovery overall suggests a progressive shift towards gender equity that contrasts with that of traditional sectors.
 
The Shift and The Factors Behind It
 
Delving further into the report, findings from the Pantera Research Lab survey reveal that the median annual salary for US-based female employees in the digital currency sector is $172,000, compared to $150,000 for men.

A week after its launch, the massive outflows, led by Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), have outshined the remarkable start of the ETH-based investment products.
 
Ethereum ETFs Performance Outshined By Outflows
 
The approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs was surrounded by discussions about its demand and possible performance after the launch. Many experts anticipated that the investment products would not achieve the same numbers as their Bitcoin-based counterparts, citing a lack of a “clear narrative,” media attention, and demand.
