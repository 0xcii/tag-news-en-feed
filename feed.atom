According to Wired, the court in the Southern District of New York will decide on June 15 whether to allow FTX to pursue GGC over payments made shortly before the exchange’s collapse, amid allegations of fraud.
 
GGC filed for bankruptcy in January, after being caught in the blowback from FTX’s implosion. However, the firm only has about $5 billion in assets, meaning that if the court allows FTX to go ahead, a zero-sum legal battle will ensue.

The SEC also accused Coinbase of failing to register its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was one of the biggest losers in crypto markets on Tuesday, as markets continued to react to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suing Binance and Coinbase. The global cryptocurrency market lost nearly 4% of its value in today’s session. Solana was another notable mover, falling by 9% today. 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) fell to a three-month low on Tuesday, as traders continued to react to news that the SEC had sued both  and Coinbase.
 
The Coinbase suit alleges that the exchange has been operating as an unregistered broker, whilst Binance has been accused of violating U.S. securities laws.
 
DOGE/USD dropped to a low of $0.06483 on the news, which is its weakest point since March 10.
 
 
The sell-off comes a day after the meme coin was trading at a peak of $0.07163, but it has gone on to drop by over 7%.
 
From a technical point of view, the decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) moved below a floor of 33.00
 
As of writing, the index is deep in oversold territory, and is currently tracking at 29.33.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
In addition to DOGE, solana (SOL) also fell big in today’s session, losing over 9% of its value.
 
After a high of $21.54 to start the week, SOL/USD slipped to an intraday low of $19.42 earlier today.
 
Following the plunge in price, solana fell to its lowest point since May 27, when it was last below $20.00.
 
 
Similar to dogecoin, today’s decline came as a result of a breakout which occurred on the RSI indicator.
 
Price Strength fell below a key point of support at 42.00, and is currently at a reading of 40.63.
 
In the event that bearish pressure intensifies, the next target could be a lower floor at $18.50.

Taxpayers are expected to report digital transactions from the start of 2023 under the Infrastructural Investment and Jobs Act. But the lawmakers stated that such regulations are not yet promulgated.

The Congressmen, Brad Sherman, and Stephen Lynch, wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel regarding tax compliance in the digital asset industry. They faulted crypto firms as the main source of the tax gap in the United States.

By owning these iconic ‘Treasure Trunks’, people can access future products, and experiences, and join a community of fellow owners.
 
It’s an exciting move by Louis Vuitton which helps to explore the potential of NFTs and enhance the luxury ownership experience. The digital world’s blockchain technology can now provide the same feeling of exclusive ownership as the real world.
 
By offering an unchangeable, transparent, and publicly accessible system to prove ownership, blockchain has made owning a unique digital asset like a nonfungible token (NFT) just as satisfying as possessing its physical counterpart.
