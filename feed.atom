        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A whopping $41 million has been lost in October so far due to the increasing influx of phishing attacks. Most of the phishing operations within the crypto space usually involve engaging users in signing actions through their crypto wallets, to approve contracts or linking permissions.
 
 
Making false tokens that look like real wallet tokens is one typical phishing method used to pilfer cryptocurrencies from victims’ wallets. Particularly harmful is permit phishing since it lets several highly valuable tokens be transferred simultaneously.

The rationale behind Tesla’s recent BTC transfer is currently unclear.
