Capturing the Thai Crypto Market
Satang has been operating as a crypto exchange in the country since 2017 and offers an array of services, including custody, staking, and crypto payments.

The Dominance of Meme Coins
Meme coins like DOGE always had a cult-like following. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk also endorsed Doge on multiple occasions and even briefly changed the logo of X (previously Twitter) to the dog face of Doge. Musk's tweets even make Doge swing in double digits.

Why Ripple CEO Lashed Out At Clayton
 
In response to an interview of Clayton which resurfaced on social media, Garlinghouse posted on his X (formerly Twitter), calling out the former SEC Chair for his hypocrisy while labeling it as “shocking.” The reason for Garlinghouse’s anger isn’t farfetched as he seemed surprised that someone like Clayton could sit and have an interview where he talked about abuse of power.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indian government should lower a tax on crypto transactions as it’s not fulfilling its stated purpose, a local cryptocurrency exchange said. The company blames the levy, which was introduced last year, for driving Indian crypto trading volumes to overseas platforms.
 
Indian Exchange Expects Government to Reduce Crypto Tax Burden
 
Authorities in New Delhi imposed a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on crypto transactions in 2022, declaring that the main goal is to track buying and selling rather than raise revenue for the state budget. But the levy has proven counterproductive and must be lowered, according to the Indian crypto exchange Coindcx.
