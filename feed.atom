        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto enthusiasts may have reason to celebrate as United States Rep. Warren Davidson announced plans to introduce legislation that could potentially lead to the removal of Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
Davidson’s move comes as a response to what he perceives as Gensler’s overreach in the digital currency space, with the SEC’s proposed redefinition of an “exchange” drawing widespread criticism. 
 
As tensions mount between regulators and the bitcoin community, the fate of Gensler and the future of crypto regulation hangs in the balance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liquidity Hub (LH), Ripple Labs’ new product, has caused a huge uproar within the XRP community. As Bitcoinist reported yesterday, the community was outraged that XRP is not part of the product, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are used to provide businesses with a seamless way to manage their crypto liquidity needs.
 
The outcry has prompted Ripple’s chief legal officer (CLO) to speak out on the issue. In a Twitter thread, Stuart Alderoty clarified that XRP may become part of the product later. He also set the record straight on the distinction between LH and the XRP based product On-Demand Liquidity (ODL).
