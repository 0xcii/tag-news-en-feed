        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. Massa’s testnet has become a magnet for more than 16 projects since its launch back in July 2021. Interest towards this innovative blockchain ecosystem has exploded since the beginning of this year. But what is it that makes Massa special? 
 
Massa is an innovative blockchain network that aims to combine high performance with true decentralization from the ground up. The Massa testnet allows anyone to experiment with the protocol and witness its continuous improvements first-hand.
 
One of the main reasons why Massa attracted so many web3 pioneers in Q1 of this year is that it solves the common challenges that most Layer 1 blockchains face, such as high fees, low throughput, and centralization risks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the core developers of Bitcoin, Luke Dashjr has sent out a call to action to put an end to the Ordinals and BRC20 meme coin craze. Dashjr is one of the world’s most prolific Bitcoin developers and has been involved in the development of Bitcoin Core since 2011 (over 12 years) and probably one of the biggest critics of Ordinals.
 
Bitcoin Core Developer Calls For Spam Filter
 
Today, the Bitcoin blockchain continues to be congested. There are currently 414,000 transactions in the mempool waiting to be added to a block, with the average medium-priority transaction fee being $13.46. As Bitcoinist reported, Ordinals and BRC20 are the main reason for the state of the network, in part because they were coded extremely ineffectively.

DoMI is essentially a 21st-century version of the Declaration of Independence, with 27 reasons listed on why fiat currency is an unfair and broken monetary system controlled by governments that favors the wealthiest and most privileged. The second half of the document lists 29 reasons why Bitcoin is the fairest and most egalitarian monetary system ever conceived and implemented.

"There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>

And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>
