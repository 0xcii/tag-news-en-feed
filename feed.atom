        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto exchanges have recently been making moves to streamline their offerings, and an unprecedented number of digital tokens are being shown the exit. As Bitcoin commands renewed interest and experiences a revival, it’s ironic to witness numerous other tokens getting the chop from major platforms.
 
According to data compiled by Kaiko, the numbers are clear: 3,445 tokens or trading pairs are on the chopping block, having been rendered inactive or slated for imminent delisting. In a comparative analysis, this figure overshadows last year’s numbers by 15% and even doubles those of the year prior, as reported by Bloomberg.

Bill Gross Foresees Economic Clouds on the Horizon
 
On Tuesday, October 24, 2023, stock markets have risen, somewhat healing from the previous week’s bruises. Despite this uptick, market conditions remain tumultuous, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield hovering at 4.84%.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now Pointing At “Greed”
 
The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator that tells us about the sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market. The index was created by Alternative and it takes into account the following factors: volatility, volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends.
 
The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100 to represent the sentiment. When the indicator has a value greater than 54, it means that the investors share a majority sentiment of greed right now.

So first, let's go through and try to understand the vulnerability itself. When a Lightning payment is routed across the network, one thing that is key to understand is how the timelocks for refunding a failed payment work.

Crypto whales, a term used to describe individuals or entities that hold large amounts of cryptocurrencies, have notably contributed to a significant upsurge in SHIB tokens within their wallets. 
 
According to data provided by IntoTheBlock, SHIB whales amassed a staggering 4.52 trillion SHIB tokens, marking an astonishing 2,300% increase from the figures observed on Friday.
 
The implications of such pronounced whale activity on the price of Shiba Inu tokens have become a topic of intense speculation within the crypto community. With the surge in SHIB tokens being added to whale accounts, the market sentiment has been notably impacted.
