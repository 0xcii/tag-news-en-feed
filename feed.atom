Bitcoin Network Block Time Has Been Slower Than Normal Recently
 
The “Mining Difficulty” refers to how hard miners would find to mine blocks on the BTC network. The Difficulty’s purpose is to ensure that the total time between each block being added to the blockchain, known as the block time, stays constant for around 10 minutes.
 
 
Whenever the pace of the miners deviates from this value, the network adjusts its Difficulty to get block time back to the standard one. These adjustments occur about every two weeks, with the latest one set to go live at some point tomorrow.

Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs Struggle Despite Strong Initial Launch
 
Hong Kong launched six virtual asset spot ETFs on April 30, initially attracting significant interest with a combined issuance scale of $248 million—surpassing the approximately $125 million raised by the US Bitcoin ETFs at their launch in January.
