        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instant settlement profoundly transforms our behavior as it reconnects us with the elemental laws of nature. The existing paradigm mirrors the primal imperative of reaping benefits in exchange for labor–working to survive, but the pay-per-time system in the labor market is creating the incentive to get something for nothing. In the whole “fiat stack,” everyone optimizes their efforts to achieve this on different levels, as I explain below. How can I get money for nothing? As we explore the effects of instant settlement across diverse industries, a fundamental divide between workers and clockwatchers emerges, as I have argued throughout this series. Fiat payments work without instant settlement; instead, a virtual credit arrives immediately with the actual settlement usually coming much lat…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recent surge in the price of Bitcoin, propelling it to a three-year high, has notably impacted the profitability landscape for investors. According to data from IntoTheBlock, an overwhelming 99.17% of Bitcoin holders find themselves in a profitable position as of the latest market update.
 
 
This substantial figure indicates a robust market sentiment, with a vast majority of investors benefiting from the upward momentum in Bitcoin’s value. From a technical analysis perspective, this surge could be attributed to various factors such as increased institutional interest, positive market sentiment, and a favorable macroeconomic environment, contributing to a sustained bullish trend.

Investor Claims XRP Is Not A Scam But Will Struggle For Growth
 
In a post on X, Alfred said though XRP is not an “outright scam like Hex,” there are similar concerns about its underlying mechanism. The value investor continued, adding that this assessment is because XRP functions primarily as a “token printing scheme” enriching founders and insiders. 
 
For this reason, XRP, the cryptocurrency listed across multiple exchanges, has been flat-lining for the past seven years. The investor pinned this to the excessive token minting over the years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to share some thoughts on a seemingly overlooked innovation that has come to Bitcoin within the last year, called Bitpacs. 
Bitpac stands for a Bitcoin Based Publicly Auditable Cooperative. Bitpacs are essentially normal bitcoin multisig wallets with the additional introduction of public auditability. Traditionally in a multisig setup, participants of the multisig are not disclosed. In a Bitpac multisig, participants are intentionally made public, which allows for transparent auditability. With this transparency, unique features, tooling, rules, and transaction crafting is possible. The goal of Bitpacs is to emulate the familiar DAO experience on other chains.
