Tether Supply Rises While Competitor Stablecoins See Declines
 
Much has changed in the past three months following the collapse of FTX and its aftermath. The stablecoin economy has experienced significant redemptions, and 30-day statistics from February 14, 2023, show that three of the top five stablecoins have seen a decline in their market capitalizations.

Bitcoin Taproot Utilization Hits New All-Time High Of 4.2%
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, both Taproot adoption and utilization have hit all-time highs recently. “Taproot” is a BTC upgrade that introduced some changes to how transactions are processed, to make them faster and more efficient. The upgrade went live back in the November of 2021.
 
The “Taproot adoption” here is a metric that tells us how much adoption the upgrade has seen among users on the network. The indicator is inspired by the one the community came up with for monitoring SegWit adoption (SegWit being another BTC protocol that went live back in 2017).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded in Tuesday’s session, as markets prepared for this afternoon’s U.S. inflation report. It is expected that the annual rate of inflation in the United States dropped to 6.2% in January, down 0.3% from the month prior. Ethereum also rallied, climbing back above $1,500.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded from recent losses in today’s session, as prices moved closer to the $22,000 level.
 
BTC/USD hit an intraday high of $21,849.01 earlier in the day, which comes after falling to a low of $21,460.09 on Monday.
 
Today’s action saw bitcoin snap a two-day losing streak, and comes as prices rejected a full breakout of a floor at $21,500.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also rejected a break of its own, with the index remaining above its support at 44.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is at a reading of 47.86, with a resistance of 50.00 nearby.
 
In order for BTC bulls to take price above the $22,000 mark, this point of resistance will need to be broken.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Etheruem (ETH) climbed back above $1,500 on Tuesday, as it also reentered a recent support point.
 
Following a low of $1,470.02 to start the week, ETH/USD rallied to a peak of $1,514.08 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of this move, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency is once again trading above its long-term floor at $1,505.
 
 
Despite this, overall market momentum remains bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) extending its death cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
What has somewhat helped to ease the current market sentiment is the floor of 44.00 on the RSI indicator.
 
Should the floor break, there is a strong possibility that ethereum will be heading for the $1,450 mark.

Under the theme “Cooperation In A Fragmented World,” 52 heads of state and many corporate CEOs, along with celebrities and prominent social activists, talked about how to manage the risks that we will be facing in the next decade.

Also, while the all-time high of $3.09 from September 2, 2021 is still -88.28% away, the year-to-date rally of over 45% has fueled new hopes.
 
Cardano’s technical development by IOG continues to be actively driven. Today, Valentine’s Day, February 14, Cardano will implement a new software upgrade.
 
“Valentine” is intended to enable secure on-chain interactions and advance blockchain interoperability through cross-chain dApp development on the Plutus platform. These fundamentally strong reasons are also reflected in on-chain data, as Santiment’s latest research shows.

Africa is a continent that is rich with potential and opportunity. However, due to prolonged periods of negative portrayals and limited access to resources or capital, it has not been able to maximise this potential. This has led to a lack of economic growth and development in many African countries.
 
While many attempts have been made to address these issues, the lack of a secure and efficient alternative capital and fundraising market has resulted in further economic stagnation. This is where cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and the recently launched DPA Token (DPAT) come into play.
