The Fall of “Crypto King”
The announcement yesterday (Wednesday) by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) detailed that, along with the 25-year-old Pleterski, the authorities also charged his associate, 27-year-old Colin Murphy, with fraud. The arrest and the charges came after a 16-month-long joint investigation by the OSC and the Durham Regional Police Service (DRPS). Dubbed Project Swan, the investigation started amid the bankruptcy case tied to the investment scheme that gathered media attention.
