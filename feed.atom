        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant development for the cryptocurrency market, the bankrupt exchange FTX has received court approval to liquidate its crypto assets worth over $3.4 billion. The decision, delivered by Judge John Dorsey, overruled objections and permitted FTX to proceed with selling, staking, and hedging its holdings. 
 
The exchange had submitted a filing in August, arguing that such activities would mitigate downside risks and generate returns on idle digital assets for the benefit of the estates and creditors.
 
FTX Authorized To Liquidate Digital Assets Holdings
 
FTX’s crypto assets include several notable holdings, with $1.1 billion in SOL (Solana), $560 million in BTC (Bitcoin), $192 million in ETH (Ethereum), $137 million in APT, $119 million in XRP, and $46 million in STG.
