Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) jumped back above the $27,000 level to start the week, as sentiment showed glimpses of shifting after last week’s bear run.
 
Following a low of $26,762.25 on Sunday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $27,521.62 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency continue to move away from a floor at $26,500, and a recent two-month low.

Monday’s rise in price sees bitcoin move higher for a second straight day, breaking out of a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI) in the process.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 43.66, which is marginally above the aforementioned resistance at 43.00.
 
Bulls will now likely be looking to reenter the $28,000 level, which was last hit this past Thursday.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also made gains to start the week, as it moved beyond the $1,800 mark in today’s session.
 
ETH/USD rose to a high of $1,834.94 on Monday, less than 24 hours after falling to a bottom at $1,787.54.
 
Similar to BTC, today’s move is the second consecutive day ETH has risen, and comes following the recent eight-day losing streak.

This resulted in ethereum dropping to its weakest point since March, however it now appears that momentum has now shifted.
 
Price strength on ethereum has also risen, climbing above a key point of resistance at the 44.00 level.
 
The index is now tracking at the 45.85 mark, with the next ceiling at the 50.00 level.
