SEC Files “Notice of Appeal”

A “notice of appeal” is a formal filing in a superior court by a party involved in a lawsuit, notifying the court and the opposing side of its decision to appeal.
Although the judge imposed a penalty on the blockchain company, it was significantly lower than the nearly $2 billion the SEC had sought in the form of recovery and fines.

Trading and deposits for Monero in the European Economic Area (EEA) will be shut off before the end of October, 2024. Increasing regulatory scrutiny was cited as a reason for the move. The pressure has dragged the coin’s price below $150, showing that privacy-focused cryptocurrencies still face a lot of setbacks.
 
 
The Price Decline
 
Monero has also not been spared in the rollercoaster ride in terms of price. Days before the Kraken delisting announcement, it was hovering around $158, failing to maintain its footing amidst a broader bearish trend that has eaten up much of the cryptocurrencies’ value.
