        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FTX estate, currently overseeing the bankruptcy and restructuring of the once-active crypto exchange, reveals holdings of $1.16 billion in solana (SOL) and $560 million in bitcoin (BTC).
 
16% of Solana’s Market Cap Is Held by FTX
 
In a recent Monday court filing, a stakeholder update showcases the premier digital assets held by the estate. As of August 31, 2023, these liquid tokens have a combined value of $3.4 billion. Additionally, the update showcases nearly $200 million in Bahamian real estate. Solana (SOL) emerges as the dominant asset in FTX’s portfolio.
 
 
As of September 11, 2023, with SOL’s market cap standing at $7.24 billion, FTX’s slice is a significant 16%, equating to $1.16 billion. FTX’s diverse crypto portfolio also includes $560 million in BTC, $192 million in ETH, $137 million in APT, $120 million in USDT, $119 million in XRP, $49 million in BIT, $46 million in STG, $41 million in WBTC, and $37 million in WETH. Furthermore, FTX possesses over $529 million in securities housed in Debtor brokerage accounts, of which $417 million resides in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).
 
 
Apart from that, a modest $0.1 million is placed in Blackrock equity under FTX’s control. Delving into FTX’s venture collection, it boasts 438 investments, amassing $4.5 billion in funded assets. Notably, it includes a significant stake in Anthropic, a rival to Openai and the brains behind the generative AI chatbot, Claude. It’s worth mentioning that FTX also owns over 1,000 illiquid crypto assets, which may not realize their full potential value.

Bitcoin Shrimps Accumulated During The Bear Market Crashes This Cycle
 
In a new post on X, the lead on-chain analyst at Glassnode,@_Checkmatey_, has discussed how the behavior of the shrimps has evolved in the BTC sector during recent years.
 
The “shrimps” here refer to investors who are carrying less than 1 BTC in their wallets. One way to track the behavior of these retail holders is through the shrimp “net position change,” which measures the monthly increases or decreases that are taking place in the combined supply of this cohort.
 
The below chart highlights the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the last few years:

        <updated>2023-09-11T19:05:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent appearance on Fox Business, Anthony "Pomp" Pompliano suggested that a significant Bitcoin bull run is on the horizon. Pompliano, a well-known figure in the Bitcoin space, shared his insights on the future of Bitcoin and why he believes it is primed for another surge.
Pompliano began the discussion by highlighting the recent volatility in the market, with Bitcoin experiencing a period of fluctuation in recent months. However, he emphasized that this is not unusual for the market and is part of the asset class's nature. Pompliano stated that such volatility should not deter investors from considering Bitcoin as a long-term investment.
One of the key factors driving Pompliano's optimism is the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. This year, numerous prominent companies, including BlackRock and Fidelity, filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC, signaling a shift in the perception of Bitcoin from a speculative asset to a legit store of value. Pompliano believes a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved by the end of this year, while more institutions also recognize the value of holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.
Pompliano also discussed the potential for Bitcoin to disrupt traditional financial institutions. He argued that Bitcoin's decentralized nature and borderless accessibility could challenge the dominance of central banks and traditional financial intermediaries. While acknowledging the regulatory challenges that Bitcoin faces, Pompliano believes that innovation will ultimately prevail and that Bitcoin will play a significant role in the future of finance.
Anthony Pompliano's optimism about a forthcoming Bitcoin bull run is rooted in the growing institutional adoption, international recognition, and the potential for Bitcoin to reshape the financial landscape. As Bitcoin continues to evolve and mature, it remains a topic of great interest and debate among investors and financial experts alike.]]></summary>
