        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fox Business Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino has raised the possibility that the favorable ruling received by Ripple from Judge Analisa Torres against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might not withstand higher judicial review.

The meme coin experienced a surge in trading volume during the week that allowed it to successfully surpass the $0.22 price mark for the first time since November 2021. This spike saw the price of DOGE increasing by as much as 33% during the week, outperforming the likes of Bitcoin and other large market-cap cryptocurrencies. 
 
 
Interestingly, the price surge was on the back of increased activity from whales, as indicated by on-chain data. The increased activity led to an increased accumulation trend from this cohort of traders, as noted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez. According to the analyst, Dogecoin whales purchased 1.40 billion DOGE over the past two weeks, worth around $280 million.
