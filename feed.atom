        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is planning  
to move to court to challenge the ruling that granted Ripple Labs a partial win  
against the agency. The SEC has reportedly written to a judge in Manhattan to  
allow the federal court of appeal to examine the ruling, which was made in July.
On July 13, US District  
Judge Analisa Torres ruled that the sale of Ripple’s cryptocurrency XRP on  
public exchange did not amount to a violation of the securities regulations.  
The decision was against SEC’s argument that the blockchain payments platform  
sold unregistered securities to the public.
Ripple’s Win against SEC
In her ruling, Torres explained that Ripple did not violate the  
securities law because the purchasers of XRP did not expect to make a  
profit based on Ripple’s effo…]]></summary>

the prolonged period of cryptocurrency winter is behind us, digital asset  
market companies still feel its adverse effects. The consolidation of Bitcoin  
(BTC) and other asset prices, low network activity, and increasing mining  
difficulty make it challenging for both miners and cryptocurrency funds to  
achieve profitability. The latest examples are publicly listed companies Riot  
Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT) and Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. (TSX: GLXY),  
which reported negative financial results in the second quarter.

With traditional markets and central banks closely monitoring the inflation metrics, the ripple effects on the digital asset market could be profound.
 
Wall Street is bracing for the July CPI data, with expectations that both the headline and core indices will rise by 0.2% from June. This would adjust the 12-month core CPI to 4.7% from June’s 4.8%, while the headline index (YoY) is predicted to ascend to 3.3% from June’s 3.0%.
 
Thomas Lee from Fundstrat Global Advisors took to Twitter, stating, “July CPI going to be revelatory.” He further elaborated on the potential outcomes: “If >0.3% mom = bad. If <0.2% mom = good.”

The decision follows a partial summary judgment and short-term victory for Ripple and XRP holders, handed down by Judge Torres in a case that commenced in December 2020.
 
The court’s ruling acknowledged that Ripple’s institutional XRP sales were deemed an unregistered securities offering. 
 
 
However, the judgment found that programmatic sales of XRP did not fall under the same classification. As a result, the trial will focus on determining the regulatory status of XRP and its impact on the cryptocurrency industry.
