        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-core-version-25-0-released"/>
        <updated>2023-05-26T17:35:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin Core version 25.0 has been released, bringing new features, bug fixes and performance improvements to the software. Users can download the latest version from the official Bitcoin Core website or update their existing installations. The release notes outline the changes and provide instructions on how to upgrade.
One notable change is the allowance of transactions of non-witness size 65 bytes and above, which opens up new use cases and enhances protections against vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-12842. Another addition is the scanblocks RPC, which allows for fast wallet rescans by returning relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors.
In terms of RPC updates, all JSON-RPC methods now accept a new named parameter called "args" for passing positional parameter values conveniently. Additionally, the verifychain RPC will now return false if checks couldn't be completed at the desired depth and level, providing more accurate feedback.
The release also includes changes to the build system, updated settings and new features. For instance, the shutdownnotify option allows users to specify a command to execute before Bitcoin Core begins its shutdown sequence. In the wallet section, new options like minconf and maxconf have been added to various RPCs, providing greater control over UTXO confirmations.
Bitcoin Core 25.0 introduces several improvements and optimizations, enhancing the user experience and security of the software. As with any release, users are encouraged to report any bugs they encounter to the official GitHub issue tracker.
Bitcoin Core is widely supported and tested on major operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and Windows. However, it is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems. Users should ensure they are running a compatible operating system before upgrading to the latest version. In addition, users are encouraged to review the release notes for a detailed understanding of the improvements in this version if upgrading.]]></summary>

a confidential report that found its security lapses responsible for over 119,000  
bitcoins stolen from the platform in August 2016, the Organized Crime and  
Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reported on Thursday. The stolen BTCs, worth about $3.2 billion in today’s market,  
were priced at $71 million at the time.
OCCRP, a global network of investigative  
journalists, said it obtained a version of the secret report that says Bitfinex failed to execute operational,  
financial and technological controls recommended by its digital security partner Bitgo. The network said the report was commissioned by iFinex, the owner and  
operator of Bitfinex, and was produced by Canada-based blockchain services  
firm, Ledger Labs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon climbed to a multi-week high on Friday, as bearish sentiment in cryptocurrency markets began to fade. The global crypto market marginally rose during today’s session, following yesterday’s downturn. XRP was another notable gainer.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was one of Friday’s big movers, as the token rose to a multi-week high during the day.
 
Following a low of $0.8802 on Thursday, MATIC/USD hit an intraday high of $0.9514 during today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, polygon recorded its strongest point since May 8, breaking out of a key resistance of $0.9500 in the process.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that this breakout occurred as the 10-day (red) moving average moved closer to an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) moved past its own ceiling at the 49.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is now tracking at 52.93, with an upcoming ceiling of 56.00 a possible hurdle for bulls.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP (formerly ripple), also saw an increase in bullish momentum, as it rebounded from a recent one-week low.
 
XRP/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $0.4673 earlier in the day, following a low of $0.4472 on Thursday.
 
Today’s peak saw the token move closer to its long-term resistance level of $0.4690, which was last broken in April.
 

 
XRP/USD – Daily ChartEarlier gains in XRP have somewhat eased, as the RSI also moved near a ceiling of its own at 55.00
 
As of writing this, the index is currently tracking at the 54.80 mark, with the price currently at $0.4673.
 
Should this ceiling at 55.00 be broken, there is a possibility that XRP will hit a one-month high in the upcoming days.

Congressman Brad Sherman's recent tweet attacking Bitcoiners as "tax evaders" is a prime example of how Bitcoin has become a mainstream phenomenon. It's ironic that politicians like Sherman, who have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and the presumption of innocence, are so quick to label Bitcoin supporters as criminals without any evidence. Such remarks undermine the fundamental principles of justice and fairness that underpin our legal system. 
The fact that politicians like Sherman are attacking Bitcoin serves as a signal to those on the fence that there may be something to this "freedom money" that is constantly under attack by th…]]></summary>

From Slim Odds to High Probability: Fedwatch Tool Indicates Higher Chance of June Rate Hike
 
Until recently, many investors and market analysts held the belief that the likelihood of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s FOMC raising the benchmark bank rate in June was extremely low.
