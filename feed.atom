        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant development, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for  
the District of Delaware has granted crypto exchange FTX permission to sell,  
invest, and hedge its crypto holdings, valued at over $3.4 billion, to settle  
outstanding debts. 
This ruling comes after FTX's legal team filed a request for  
authorization to engage in the sale of the digital assets, citing the benefits  
of hedging crypto assets and generating returns from staking certain digital  
assets for the estates and creditors.
Judge John Dorsey presided over the court hearing, where he not only approved the motion but also overruled objections raised by two parties opposing the plan. This pivotal decision allows FTX to initiate the process of selling, staking, and hedging its substantial crypto holdings.

The incident, initially thought to be a "fat-fingered" mistake, has now been traced back to an issue within PayPal's processing system, according to a report by Mempool's Mononautical. This is the largest fee ever paid for a Bitcoin transaction in dollar terms.

The investigation into the colossal overpayment, which drew widespread attention when it was first reported, has led to some unexpected discoveries. The overpaid fee was sent from a hot wallet using the address "bc1qr3...zpw3," which commenced operations in June earlier this year. On-chain activity associated with this address in…]]></summary>

company marks ten years in the industry, bringing together Huobi's mission,  
TRON token, and the essence of a crypto exchange.
The rebranding choice of  
"HTX" carries significance, the exchange explained. Breaking it down, "H" pays  
homage to Huobi, "T" symbolizes TRON, and "X" represents the essence of an exchange. This combination of "HT"  
and "X" depicts HT as the platform's native cryptocurrency, while "X" represents  
the Roman numeral for 10, acknowledging HTX's ten years in the industry.

On Tuesday, Coinex was hacked, losing about $54 million, which included 231 BTC, 6,559 ETH, 137.128 million TRX, and several million in assorted ERC20 tokens and stablecoins. Coinex informed the community about the hack after blockchain monitoring firms detected that the wallets were being drained.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ton-closes-in-on-2-after-news-of-telegram-partnership/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-13T15:37:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin moved closer to the $2.00 level on Wednesday, as markets reacted to the protocol’s partnership with Telegram. The agreement will see the token made available to over 800 million Telegram Wallet users. Stellar, on the other hand, was significantly lower, falling by nearly 8% today.
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was one of today’s biggest movers, as markets were buoyed by the news that it was partnering with Telegram.
 
Following a low of $1.73 on Tuesday, TON/USD rose to an intraday peak of $1.95 earlier in the day.
 
This surge resulted in toncoin rising by as much as 13%, nearing a recent high of $2.05 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move led to the relative strength index (RSI) colliding with a ceiling at the 66.00 level.
 
Earlier gains have since faded as a result of a failed breakout beyond this point, leading to TON now trading at $1.93.
 
In order to move above $2.00, the aforementioned ceiling on the RSI must first be broken.
 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
On the other side of the spectrum was stellar (XLM), which dropped by over 8% in today’s session.
 
XLM/USD bottomed out at $0.1195 on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after residing at a high of $0.1318.
 
This drop in price sees the token fall for a third consecutive day, falling below a floor at $0.1200 in the process.
 
 
It appears that today’s sell-off coincided with the RSI failing to remain above a point of support at 49.00.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 44.53, with the next visible zone of stability around the 37.00 region.
 
In the event that this level is reached, XLM will likely be trading under $0.1100.
