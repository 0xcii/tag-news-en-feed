        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is holding firm above $68,000 but has yet to break through the critical $69,000 level. After weeks of bullish price action, the market is closely watching for confirmation of a breakout from the seven-month accumulation pattern that has built up significant momentum.
 
Top analyst Daan recently shared his insights, stating that this breakout is now a reality, fueling optimism among investors.
 
 
As Bitcoin continues its climb, many anticipate a small retrace, followed by a strong bounce that could pave the way to challenge the all-time highs around $73,000. The key level to watch remains $69,000, and if BTC can maintain its strength above this price, a surge to new highs seems increasingly likely.
 
With the market brimming with optimism and the accumulation phase over, investors …]]></summary>

On Friday, October 18, the commission permitted the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to offer options trading for several spot Bitcoin ETFs.
 
Specifically, the NYSE received the green light to list and trade options for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC (BTC), and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). CBOE, on the other hand, is now permitted to offer options trading on the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB).

Grassroots efforts pick up pace, but the founder cautions that it is only the existence of state-level adoption that will deliver the fiat-free world that many desire to see. To date, El Salvador remains the only country to legalize Bitcoin as a legal form of currency, an ongoing theme of a state refusing recognition leading to it being the space’s biggest opposition.
