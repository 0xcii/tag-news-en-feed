Both currencies utilize the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, a factor that Lee believes positions Litecoin favorably for an ETF classification. Additionally, Lee argues that the altcoin’s status as a commodity strengthens its case for ETF eligibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changpeng Zhao, the ousted CEO of cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance, walked away from court this week with a sentence many see as a slap on the wrist.
 
Zhao, better known in the crypto world as “CZ,” received four months in prison for failing to implement sufficient anti-money laundering (AML) safeguards at Binance.
 
 
Binance Founder: Guilty But Not Laundering?
 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) did not directly accuse Zhao of money laundering itself. Instead, the charges focused on his company’s inadequate AML programs, which allegedly allowed criminals to funnel illicit funds through the exchange.
 
This distinction proved crucial in the sentencing, with some legal analysts suggesting federal guidelines for nonviolent first-time offenders limited the judge’s options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) convenes for a highly anticipated meeting today (2 pm ET), the stakes are high not just for traditional finance but also for the crypto markets, which have become increasingly sensitive to macroeconomic signals. Kurt S. Altrichter, a notable financial advisor, has provided an in-depth analysis of possible outcomes and their ramifications on X, offering a roadmap of expectations for market participants.
 
Altrichter points out that despite the scaling back of rate cut expectations—from six expected cuts at the start of the year to just one by year’s end—the markets have shown resilience. This is largely because investors still anticipate the next Federal Reserve move to be a cut, not an increase. For the crypto market, this has meant a precarious …]]></summary>
