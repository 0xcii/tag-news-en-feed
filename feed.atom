Buterin’s commentary emerged during a broader conversation on crypto security, which featured insights from several leading figures from the Ethereum ecosystem.
 
Why The Ethereum Founder Doesn’t Use Hardware Wallets
 
The debate illuminated the complexities of digital asset security and showcased a range of opinions on how best to protect these assets. Peter Watts, founder of Reservoir, pointed out the inherent risks associated with hardware wallets. He emphasized the potential personal errors that can undermine the security of such devices.

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-price-could-fall-to-50000-standard-chartered"/>
        <updated>2024-05-01T13:16:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major global bank Standard Chartered believes the Bitcoin price could see further downside to around $50,000, according to recent comments. 
Geoffrey Kendrick, head of forex and digital assets research at Standard Chartered, told The Block: "BTC's proper break below $60,000 has now reopened a route to the $50,000-52,000 range."
As of writing, Bitcoin is trading under $57,000 after a steep drawdown from recent highs above $70,000. Kendrick cited both the Bitcoin market and broader macroeconomic factors weighing on Bitcoin's price.
He highlighted five straight days of outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and the slow start for new Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs as the reasons for the recent drawdown.
Beyond markets, Kendrick pointed to deteriorating liquidity measures in the U.S. that have put pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin.
However, Standard Chartered and Kendrick maintain a bullish long-term outlook. The bank recently raised its 2024 year-end Bitcoin price target to $150,000 and sees prices potentially reaching $250,000 in 2025. 
Kendrick stated the bank's forecast remains intact, expecting the next rally to come after the 2024 U.S. elections.
Negative sentiment stemming from the recent arrests of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver could also be factors in the drawdown.

Still, the pullback also comes after Bitcoin posted seven straight months of gains, signaling a potential need for consolidation.
However, mainstream adoption continues accelerating, as seen in the massive early inflows into U.S. spot ETFs. And while Hong Kong ETF trading began slowly, these investment vehicles should unlock significant institutional demand over time.]]></summary>

Deaton, a prominent legal advocate for XRP, has issued a forceful condemnation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, accusing him of undermining ethical standards and fostering an environment of deceit at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
Deaton’s allegations emerged following a statement by Patrick McHenry, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, asserting that Gensler had misled Congress during his testimonies, particularly concerning the regulatory status of Ether as a security. McHenry’s statement reflects a broader concern about potential misrepresentations and obfuscations by the SEC which, according to him, indicate a pattern of “regulation by enforcement.”

Championed by Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, the proposed ETF is aiming to gain the coveted approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
 
Lee, brimming with optimism, recently spoke about the prospects of a Litecoin ETF. His confidence stems from the structural similarities between Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin (BTC).
 
Both currencies utilize the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, a factor that Lee believes positions Litecoin favorably for an ETF classification. Additionally, Lee argues that the altcoin’s status as a commodity strengthens its case for ETF eligibility.
