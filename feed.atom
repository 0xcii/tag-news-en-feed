        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The founder and CEO of Vailshare Capital, Dr. Jeff Ross, now argues that the reason people hold and invest in Bitcoin is not because they are diversifying. In a post on X, Ross explained that the goal is because most want to preserve and gradually grow their purchasing power, not spread risks.
 
Bitcoin Is For Preserving Purchasing Power
 
The CEO’s perspective directly contradicts the conventional wisdom often held by financial advisors. Most recommend diversification, including into store-of-value assets like gold, as a key strategy to mitigate risk. 
 
On the contrary, Ross asserts that traditional assets like bonds, while offering diversification, can be susceptible to inflation risks, potentially gnawing purchasing power in the long run.
