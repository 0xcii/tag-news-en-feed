        <updated>2023-10-19T08:55:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Facing  
challenges in the US, crypto exchange Coinbase has identified its primary  
global regulatory hub as Ireland. The platform has already applied for a  
license from the Central Bank of Ireland, aiming to align with new European  
regulations set to take effect in December 2024.
Coinbase Chooses Ireland amid  
Regulatory Challenges in the US
As the US  
tightens regulatory measures on cryptocurrency companies and the future of the  
market in the country remains uncertain, Coinbase has started looking for  
alternatives. 
The  
European Union's (EU) Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which will  
come into effect at the end of last year, are expected to provide such. If  
Coinbase secures a license from Ireland's central bank, it will be able to offer  
its services to all EU customers under "passporting" rights, opening  
up to a base of 450 million people.
Why Ireland  
over France, Germany, or Italy? In a conversation with CNBC, who first reported  
the news, Coinbase revealed that it has been operating its office in Dublin for  
over five years, employing a team of more than 100 professionals there. Ireland  
was, therefore, a natural choice.

Coinbase picks Ireland as its main EU regulatory hub as U.S. authorities go on the offensive https://t.co/prQTysNsQR
— CNBC (@CNBC) October 19, 2023
Coinbase is  
confident it will secure a license in Ireland and be prepared from day one when  
MiCA regulations come into effect, Nana Murugesan, the Vice President of  
Coinbase's International Operations, said to CNBC.
The

Their conversation revolved around the possible advantages, risks, and implications of such a decision.
 
Can Grayscale Sidestep The SEC?
 
Geraci initiated the discussion by suggesting a daring strategy: “Interesting hypothetical play for Grayscale… Just go ahead & uplist GBTC to NYSE now. Make SEC force delisting & ask for forgiveness later (or just point to court victory). Obviously we need NYSE & market makers/APs to go along (probably the trickiest part), but what’s the risk …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto exchange Binance US has suspended withdrawals in U.S. dollars. Users who want to withdraw their USD funds must first convert them into stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies, which can then be withdrawn.
 
Binance US Updates Dollar Withdrawal Policy
 
Binance US, the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange affiliated with Binance, updated its terms of use on Tuesday. The Binance US trading platform is run by BAM Trading Services Inc., an affiliate of Binance.
 
The U.S.-based crypto exchange explained that users can access their USD funds through BAM-issued stored value wallets denominated in U.S. dollars (BAM Fiat Wallets). Binance US emphasized:
 

In the event you wish to withdraw U.S. dollar funds from your account, you may convert such U.S. dollar funds to stablecoin or other digital assets, which can subsequently be withdrawn.
 
In early June, Binance US suspended U.S. dollar deposits following a court order initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to freeze its assets. The exchange also warned at the time that its banking partners were preparing to pause USD withdrawal channels as early as June 13. While the exchange managed to avoid asset freezing, its share of the total U.S. crypto trading volume has plunged.
 
 
On July 17, Binance US announced that U.S. dollar withdrawals have been restored. However, the crypto exchange continued to advise users to “use, withdraw, or convert their USD fiat balances to stablecoins to continue crypto-to-crypto trading on the platform.” The firm cautioned: “Any remaining USD balance in your account may be converted to USDT at a future date.”
 
The SEC sued Binance, CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), and BAM Trading Services on June 5. The Securities regulator filed 13 charges against them including operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies.
