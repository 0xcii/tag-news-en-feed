        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-hits-1-month-high-after-moving-past-key-price-level/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-27T14:12:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Saturday’s biggest movers is XRP, which rose to a 30-day high earlier in today’s session. The token rose for a third consecutive day, as bulls returned to the market to start the weekend. Cardano was another notable gainer today.
 
XRP
 
XRP (formerly ripple), moved to a one-month high on Saturday, as bulls began to gradually renter the market.
 
Following a low of $0.4614 on Friday, XRP/USD raced to a peak of $0.4777 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the surge, the token climbed to its highest level since April 30, when it was last above $0.4800.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came as XRP bulls broke out of a key resistance level at the $0.4750
 
This occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) also moved beyond a ceiling at the 57.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now at a reading of 58.18, with the next target for bulls potentially at 62.00.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA), was also in the green to start the weekend, with prices moving further away from a recent support level.
 
ADA/USD hit an intraday high of $0.3667 earlier in today’s session, which comes following a low of $0.3564 on Friday.
 
The move has resulted in cardano climbing to its strongest point since Wednesday, moving away from the aforementioned floor at $0.3550 in the process.
 
 
From the chart, ADA has begun to consolidate, with price now retreating from its earlier highs, following a collision with a ceiling on the RSI.
 
Price strength has failed to move past a point of resistance of 44.00 which has pushed the token to a current reading of $0.3638.

Good ol’ bitcoin, the granddaddy of cryptocurrency, is increasingly being used as a reliable store of value for those looking to move away from the more established asset classes as it is continually proving itself as a solid hedge against inflation. 
In fact, this is something I have been doing for some time now and, in this article, I will explain why I allocate a share of my wealth to bitcoin and how I see it as ideal for preserving the value of my net worth.
Why Allocate A Share Of Your Wealth To Bitcoin?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved closer to the $27,000 level on Saturday, as markets continued to react to the latest Personal Consumption data from the United States. The key inflation index rose to 4.4% in April, higher than expectations of a drop to 3.9%. Ethereum also edged higher.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rallied towards $27,000 to start the weekend, as prices reacted to the latest Personal Consumption data in the United States.
 
BTC/USD climbed to a peak of $26,916.67 earlier in today’s session, which came a day after trading at a low of $26,370.55.
 
The move sees bitcoin climb for a third straight session, moving past a floor at $26,3000 in the process.
 
 
From the chart, the latest surge in price came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a support point at 39.00.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 43.02, with the next visible point of resistance at 45.00.
 
Should this point be broken, then there is a strong possibility that BTC will move back over the $27,000 level.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also moved higher on Saturday, remaining above the $1,800 level.
 
Following a low of $1,810.37 on Friday, ETH/USD managed to hit an intraday high of $1,837.87 earlier in the day.
 
This surge led to the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency breaking out of its recent ceiling of $1,830.
 
 
However, as the day has progressed, earlier gains have somewhat fallen, with ETH now trading at $1,828.18.
 
It appears that market uncertainty has also risen, as the RSI neared a ceiling of its own at the 49.00 mark.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 48.75, and should it break out of this point, then there could be further highs from ETH this weekend.
