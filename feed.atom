        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Celsius Network, a popular cryptocurrency lending platform, is facing allegations of market manipulation by its creditors. According to a Bloomberg report, a committee representing Celsius creditors has requested a bankruptcy judge to subpoena FTX for information that could help identify users behind ten cryptocurrency wallets allegedly involved in suspicious trades of Celsius’ native token, CEL, between April and August of last year.
 
 
Fraud Allegations Arise Over CEL Token
 
The creditors believe that these FTX users may have manipulated the price of CEL through these trades, which is a serious violation of cryptocurrency market regulations. If proven true, this could significantly impact Celsius Network’s reputation and potentially lead to legal consequences for those involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The exchange will be primarily focused on education and the onboarding of newcomers.
CoinFlip, a major bitcoin ATM provider, has launched a self-custody-powered crypto platform called Olliv. 
Olliv aims to “provide a frictionless way for consumers to buy, sell, send, receive, and swap assets securely stored on a self-custodial wallet,” according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. The company seeks to welcome new investors to bitcoin by serving as an on-ramp for those they educate through its functions as a beginners exchange.
Leveraging CoinFlip’s existing network of crypto ATMs and customer service, Olliv “serves to bridge the gap between physical and digital investing, expanding accessibility to this emerging technology,” the press release states. Coinflip currently operates one of the largest bitcoin ATM networks in the world. Seemingly building off of this, the company says it plans to offer an intuitive interface for secure transactions, as well as 24/7 live customer service, in addition to providing educational resources via user-friendly content features.
"We envision a future where everyone can participate in the digital economy and utilize their holdings to make everyday purchases and gain access to previously hard-to-buy assets such as precious metals, real estate and energy, without the need for frustrating third-party intermediaries," said Rory Herriman, Chief Technology, Digital and Strategy Officer of CoinFlip. "Our vision for Olliv is to innovate and break down barriers around safety, security, and sovereignty to empower people to invest and give them individual ownership of their assets thanks to the accessibility cryptocurrency provides." 
Olliv is available for residents in the United States and Puerto Rico, except for Alaska, Iowa, New York, Oregon, Nevada, Arkansas, Louisiana and Vermont with intentions to expand in accordance with local regulation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
