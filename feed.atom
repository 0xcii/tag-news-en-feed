        <updated>2024-09-09T10:04:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tokocrypto, a member of the Binance group, has been granted  
the Physical Crypto Asset Trader (PFAK) license by Indonesia’s Commodity  
Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti). 
In 2024, Tokocrypto’s user base has expanded to over 4.5  
million, and the platform has reported a 138% increase in its monthly average  
trading volume. 
Gaining Full Authorization
The PFAK license is an important step for Tokocrypto. The  
firm initially registered as a Prospective Physical Crypto Asset Trader (CPFAK)  
in 2019. The recent licensing allows Tokocrypto to operate as a fully  
authorized physical crypto asset trader in Indonesia.
Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, acknowledged Tokocrypto’s  
achievement, noting Binance’s support in strengthening Indonesia’s Web3  
ecosystem. Teng highlighted Binance’s commitment to creating a transparent and  
secure trading environment in the region.

Growth Accelerates with PFAK
Yudhono Rawis, CEO of Tokocrypto, emphasized the importance  
of the PFAK license in achieving Tokocrypto’s goal of becoming Indonesia’s  
leading crypto-asset trading platform. Rawis expressed satisfaction in  
Tokocrypto being the third exchange to obtain the license and credited  
Binance’s ongoing support as a factor in Tokocrypto’s growth and market  
leadership.
According to the firm, Tokocrypto’s growth in 2024,  
characterized by its expanding user base and increased trading volume, is  
expected to be further bolstered by the PFAK license. This development is  
likely to enhance the platform’s position and influence in Indonesia’s crypto  
sector.

But even with this impressive spike, many investors are questioning whether Helium (HNT) can catch up to the meteoric rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE), which has already seen a 150% increase. Both tokens are making waves in their respective fields, but what exactly sets them apart? Let’s explore the factors driving these two cryptocurrencies and see which one could come out on top.
 
Helium’s Rally Defies Market Trends

Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Integration of De-Fi and Yield Farming Draws Attention 
One of the reasons why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is outshining Helium (HNT) is its innovative use of decentralized finance (De-Fi).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mainstream Bitcoin ETFs are having a bad time lately, as $706 million of outflows were recorded. This makes it one of the largest sets of withdrawals since May, showing growing unease among investors.
 
 
This has been driven by the fall in BTC price to its lowest since early August. The sentiment among investors is also changing drastically amidst uncertainty that pervades the market. Markets attribute this change in fortunes to seasonal trends and speculation of US rate cuts.
 
Huge Net Outflows
 
In the most recent data available, which is from September 6, net outflows from 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs hit a high of $170 million. Fidelity and Grayscale had been at the top, with Fidelity’s FBTC amassing close to $86 million in outflows on the day to mark its seventh consecutive session in negat…]]></summary>
