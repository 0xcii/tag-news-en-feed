Bitcoin HODLers Have Gone Back To Net Accumulation
 
As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the long-term holders have been increasing their supply recently. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors who have held onto their coins for more than 155 days.
 
These holders make up one of the two main divisions of the BTC market based on holding time, with the other cohort being known as the “short-term holders” (STHs).
 
 
Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell, so the LTHs, who tend to hold for long periods, represent the stubborn side of t…]]></summary>

At spot rates, Bitcoin is down 6% from last week’s highs and roughly 12% from all-time highs. Contracting prices also mean lower lows from all-time highs, a bearish signal.

The return of the claim in its entirety became possible as the bankruptcy administrator of the bankrupt BlockFi “successfully sold… outstanding claims against FTX for an amount in excess of the face value of the claims.”
“While these recoveries cannot undo the impact of the platform pause, efficiently distributing 100% of the dollarised value of allowed claims to eligible clients in the near future is an extraordinarily positive outcome,” the announcement noted.
