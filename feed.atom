I want to draw your attention to the fact that Bitcoin transactions ultimately occur between wallets. There are humans behind wallets, but this connection is not really what’s important. The pseudonymity of Bitcoin is thanks to the fact that there is no direct connection between the wallet and the person who owns it. It is what distinguishes a Bitcoin wallet from any other financial instrument. No matter how much regulators try to change this, the core of the technology remains the same.

Tether Market Cap Skyrockets to $83.23 Billion, Breaking Previous May 2022 Record
 
With a market cap of $83.23 billion, tether (USDT) has now surpassed the stablecoin’s prior highest market capitalization. The previous peak in market cap happened just before Terra’s formerly stable coin UST lost its peg on May 9, 2023. On that day, USDT’s market cap stood at $83.2 billion, but by June 1, 2022, it had decreased to $72 billion. Following FTX’s collapse, USDT’s market valuation had dipp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to erase last week’s gains on Thursday, as prices dropped for a fourth straight session. The latest decline comes ahead of tomorrow’s non-farm payrolls (NFP) report from the United States. Despite today’s weakness, ethereum remained above $1,800.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved below the $27,000 level in today’s session, ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls report.
 
It is expected that the number of jobs added to the U.S. economy will come in at 190,000, less than the 253,000 sum the month prior.
 
BTC/USD fell to a low of $26,671.72 earlier in the day, which comes following a peak at $27,346.11 the day before.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this latest decline occurred as a result of the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a floor of 46.00.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 44.58, with a support point of 43.00 as a possible target.
 
Should this level be hit, there is a strong possibility that BTC will hit a floor of its own around $26,300.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was marginally lower today, however, it managed to remain above the $1,800 level.
 
Following a high of $1,887.71 on Thursday, ETH/USD declined to an intraday bottom at $1,846.23 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw ethereum edge towards a key price floor at $1,830, however, bulls have so far resisted this collision.
 
 
Similar to BTC, ETH has now fallen for a fourth straight day, with the catalyst being a failed break out of a ceiling at $1,930.
 
In addition to this, the RSI is now at a reading of 51.54, after failing to move past its own resistance at 59.00.
 
Overall, ETH has now rebounded from its previous low, and is now trading at $1,862.93.

gained momentum in American politics for multiple reasons. There is a rising  
apprehension about the use of cryptocurrency for unlawful activities, such as

a demand for stricter regulations and supervision to prevent such activities.  

There is also an increasing curiosity about the potential  
advantages of cryptocurrency, such as enhanced financial inclusion and better  
cross-border payments. This has given rise to pro-crypto politicians who  
endorse the growth and acceptance of cryptocurrency in the United States.
