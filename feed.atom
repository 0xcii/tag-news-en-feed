As a result, over 170,000 traders lost their positions, amounting to more than $1 billion in losses. However, not all crypto traders suffered due to the crash as one GMX whale trader made almost 7-figures in profit. On a closer look, the whale seems to be on a streak with an impressive 80% win rate over the last two months.
 
GMX Whale Trader Makes Almost $1 Million
 
When the crypto market crashed last week and the price of Ethereum fell from above $1,800 to below $1,600, most of the market was caught aware. But one GMX whale trader was properly positioned to profit from such a crash and they were rewarded handsomely for their foresight.

AFPI: A CBDC ‘Would Represent the Greatest Threat to What Little Financial Privacy and Data Security Americans Enjoy’
 
According to the AFPI’s report, introducing a CBDC could grant the government unparalleled access to all financial transactions, eroding citizens’ privacy. They reference the IRS’s recent data exposures as an indication that federal agencies might not be equipped to handle Americans’ transaction data safely.

        Bitcoin volatility returns with an exchange rate crash. 
    
Aug. 17, marked the return of the much-awaited and notorious bitcoin volatility.

Bitcoin Open Interest Is Steadily Going Up Right Now
 
In a new post on X, Maartunn, the community manager at CryptoQuant Netherlands, has looked into how the derivative metrics for Bitcoin right now compare against those seen before the recent crash.
 
There are mainly two indicators of interest here: the open interest and the funding rate. The former measures the total number of BTC positions on the derivative platforms.
 
When this metric’s value goes up, investors are opening up new market positions. Generally, such a trend leads to higher volatility for the cryptocurrency, as the total leverage in the market also increases with the indicator’s rise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The global crypto market already boasts an impressive market cap of over $1 trillion. However, a report from Northern Trust in collaboration with HSBC, says that this figure could still rise exponentially, and a Wall Street analyst has suggested that XRP is the coin to buy to take advantage of this growth.
 
Digital Assets To Account For 10% Of Global Assets
 
According to the report, digital assets are expected to account for up to 10% of all assets by 2030. That means the market could be valued at over $14.5 trillion since these financial firms also project that the global asset market could rise to as high as $145.4 trillion by 2025. 
 
 
The basis for this projection is premised on the growing rise of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and other tec…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a surprising turn of events, Terra, the renowned  
blockchain that collapsed in May last year, has found itself in the midst of a  
security crisis. The platform's website fell victim to a sophisticated phishing  
attack that has left users vulnerable to potential threats.
According to a statement  
issued on X (formerly Twitter) today (Monday), the attackers  
managed to compromise Terra's website and have since attempted to initiate  
phishing scams that could potentially compromise users' information. Thus, the  
official Terra's account has issued a cautionary advisory, urging users to remain  
vigilant and exercise caution when interacting with the website.
"To avoid potential

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ltc-etc-rebound-on-monday-despite-bearish-sentiment/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin was back in the green to start the week, despite the crypto market continuing to trend mostly lower. At the time of writing, the global market cap is down 0.59%, following a recent red wave. Ethereum classic also climbed higher on Monday, hitting a four-day high in the process.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) rose for a third consecutive session on Monday, as the token continued to move away from a recent nine-month low.
 
Following a bottom at $64.33 on Sunday, LTC/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $66.70 earlier in the day.
 
LTC has mostly been in the green since falling to its lowest point since November, during last week’s session.
 
 
As a result of recent bearish momentum, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) dropped below the 20.00 mark.
 
Currently, the index is at a reading of 21.13, which is marginally below an upcoming resistance level of 23.00.
 
If litecoin were to break out of this level, the next price target will likely be $70.00.
 
 
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
 
Additionally, ethereum classic also moved higher to start the week, following a recent drop below a floor at $15.00.
 
ETC/USD rose to a high of $15.90 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $15.38.
 
 
Today’s peak sees ethereum classic trade at its highest point since last Thursday, when price was over $16.00.
 
Price strength on ETC is now hovering around 28.00, with a ceiling of 29.00 the next obstacle to overcome.
 
Should it rise beyond this hurdle, there is a good chance that ETC will be above $16.00.
