        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new HBO documentary is set to reveal the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of the world’s largest and most widely used cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC). 
 
According to a Politico report, the documentary will air next Wednesday, October 9, and is the latest work from Emmy-nominated filmmaker Cullen Hoback, known for his previous series “Q: Into the Storm,” which exposed the origins of the QAnon conspiracy theory.
 
The Hunt For Satoshi Nakamoto
 
Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to control approximately 1.1 million BTC, a fortune that could make him one of the wealthiest individuals in the world.

As revealed by the Tokyo-listed company, this increase in its Bitcoin bags was possible due to a smart options trading strategy, which led to the company earning more BTC and adding it to its portfolio.
 
What Was The Smart Option Strategy?
 
According to Metaplanet, it earned roughly 23.972 BTC, equating to around $1.40 million at current prices, by selling Bitcoin put options and collecting premiums. 
 
The firm revealed this was possible by entering a BTC options transaction with QCP Capital, selling 223 Bitcoin put options with a strike price of $62,000 per Bitcoin. The company further explained:

This move came on the heels of the final judgment by the US District Court, Southern District of New York on August 7, which the SEC is now contesting.
 
In the notice, the agency does not specify which elements of the case it will appeal. The ambiguity leaves room for speculation whether the SEC will challenge both decisions by Judge Torres, the ruling on programmatic sales of XRP which also clarified that XRP itself is not a security (from July 2023) or the remedies imposed on Ripple’s institutional sales, finalized on August 7.

As tensions between Iran and Israel intensify, risk-on assets like Bitcoin may face a downturn as investors flock to safer investments such as gold. However, Kendrick suggests that the potential pullback in digital assets like BTC could be an opportunity for accumulation.
 
 
In a recently shared note, Kendrick remarked:
