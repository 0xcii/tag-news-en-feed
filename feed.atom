        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-eth-consolidate-ahead-of-us-consumer-sentiment-data/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-27T13:37:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated on Friday, as traders prepared for the release of the upcoming consumer sentiment figures from the United States. Following a move to a five-month high on Thursday, prices were once again below $23,000. Ethereum also slipped, moving below $1,600 in the process.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell back below $23,000 on Friday, as markets consolidated ahead of U.S. consumer sentiment data.
 
BTC/USD slipped to a bottom of $22,654.59 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $23,215.00.
 
The drop came ahead of this afternoon’s U.S. consumer sentiment report, which is expected to come in at a reading of 64.6.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) also edged closer to a floor of 78.00, leading to a slight shift in momentum.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average continues to move in an upward direction, however should the index move below 78.00, this trend will likely reverse.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 79.64, with BTC/USD trading at $22,965.60.
 
 
Ethereum
 
There was a slight shift in sentiment in ethereum (ETH), with prices moving below $1,600 during today’s session.
 
Following a high of $1,619.45 on Thursday, ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,565.25 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s move came as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency was unable to break out of a resistance level of $1,640 on Wednesday.
 
 
Since this time, prices have moved to lower lows in back-to-back sessions, with ethereum’s RSI also dropping below a key point of support.
 
The index is tracking at 61.94, which is marginally under its recent floor at 63.00, and its weakest level since January 8.
 
Should this bearish trend continue into the weekend, there is a strong possibility that ETH will hit a floor at $1,500.

I am one of those who was fortunate enough to find out about Bitcoin more than a decade ago before it gained mainstream attention. Sadly, I am also one of the morons who saw this opportunity, didn’t think too much of it at first and let it fly by. 
In this little story, I’d like to share the path that led me to pass on investing in bitcoin three different times before eventually giving in and becoming a HODLer. So, here are the key lessons I learned along this journey that are worth sharing with anyone who is still doubting BTC.
