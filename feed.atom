In a series of X (Twitter) posts, Ripple executives shared their frustrations with the SEC after it ignored the court’s recent decision on XRP.
 
Despite a recent court ruling, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, challenges the agency’s continued claim that XRP is a security. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, has joined the chorus, calling the SEC “a renegade agency.”
 
 
Ripple’s troubles with the SEC has a long history. Ripple was launched in 2012 and caught the industry’s attention in such a short time. By 2013, the company rebranded to Ripple Labs and soon partnered with Germany’s Fidor Bank. Ripple’s decentralization and unique consensus mechanism val…]]></summary>

Given the increasing popularity of digital assets like Bitcoin and Ripple’s XRP among South Africans, the agency’s latest move isn’t surprising. Also, many have expected the tax policy following the Financial Sector Conduct Authority’s decision to declare crypto as a financial instrument.

While Biden has been quite aggressive in his approach to corporate regulation, Cramer sees Harris as more of a centrist and believes that may lead to a pro-business environment that could prove stability in markets during what he terms “Black November” economic commotion.
