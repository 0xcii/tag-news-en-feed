Just look at what happened in May 2021, when Elon Musk effectively “broke” bitcoin’s price as Tesla announced it would no longer accept BTC as payment, citing environmental concerns. The price of a single bitcoin dropped by nearly $8,000 in the two hours following the announcement. There are countless similar cases as well.
But the takeaway is this: It’s very clear that the perception of Bitcoin’s fundamentals goes far beyond the security of the network, the soundness of the code and the asset’s limited supply. Bitcoin’s energy…]]></summary>
