        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A tweet by Michael Saylor, calling Bitcoin a “20% off,” went viral. MicroStrategy co-founder and chairman Saylor has been vocal about Bitcoin. The newest missive occurred during the crypto’s most turbulent price.
 
 
At the moment, BTC changes hands at about $60,550 and has thus far failed to close above $61,000. Perhaps this is the cause of mixed feelings among investors.
 
Saylor’s Message And Its Interpretation
 
In a post, Saylor tweeted a rather interesting photograph of an old signpost with the words, “For Sale, 1 BTC,” and captioned it, “Bitcoin: 20% off. Sale ends soon.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dennis Kelleher, the CEO of Better Markets, has revealed who is more likely to win if an appeal occurs in the legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Both parties have not intended to appeal the case, although it remains a possibility.

From Greenpeace’s high-profile “Change the Code, Not the Climate” campaign to Alex DeVries' exaggerated claims about Bitcoin’s growing "water footprint," the media often portrays Bitcoin mining as an environmental disaster in the making. For the general public, who are genuinely concerned about environmental preservation but lack in-depth knowledge of Bitcoin mining, these narratives are alarming.
