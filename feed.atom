        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-remains-near-multi-month-high-on-monday/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-05T15:53:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP remained near a multi-month high to start the week, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly tracking lower. The global market cap has fallen by 1.58% as of writing, due to today’s red wave. Litecoin was a notable token to fall, dropping by nearly 5%.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, remained near a multi-month high on Monday, despite today’s bearish sentiment.
 
XRP/USD rose to a peak of $0.5447 to start the week, which is marginally lower than Sunday’s high at $0.5466.
 
As a result of this, ripple remains close to its highest level since March 30, which saw markets peak at $0.5575.
 
 
Overall, the drop off from Sunday comes as traders opt to secure gains, which coincides with the relative strength index (RSI) dropping out of a support point.
 
Price strength fell below the floor at 69.00 earlier in the day, and is currently tracking at 67.75.
 
Should momentum continue in this direction, XRP bears will likely target a floor at $0.5090.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
On the other hand, litecoin (LTC) was one of Monday’s biggest losers, as prices fell by as much as 5%.
 
Following a high of $96.36 on Sunday, LTC/USD sank to an intraday bottom at the $91.79 level.
 
This drop sees litecoin fall for a second consecutive session, after a false breakout of a ceiling at $96.00
 
 
Looking at the chart, prices were relatively overbought, with the RSI hovering close to a ceiling at 62.00, prior to the decline.
 
Previous LTC bulls likely shifted their positions due to the proximity with the aforementioned resistance point.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 52.00 after this sell-off, with a floor at 50.00 a potential landing zone.

Ethereum Profit-Taking Volume Has Spiked To Highest Levels Since January
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, a large amount of profit-taking seems to have been going on in the Ethereum market recently. The relevant indicator here is the “ratio of on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss,” which, as its name already suggests, tells us about how the profit-taking transfers currently compare with the loss-taking ones.
 
The indicator separates these two volumes by looking at the on-chain history of each coin being sold/moved to see what price it was last sold at. If this previous price for any coin was less than the price that…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency markets consolidated to start the week, with bitcoin trading below the $27,000 mark during today’s session. Volatility has been significantly higher in the past few days, as the unemployment rate in the United States surged to a multi-month high.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was trading below the $27,000 level on Monday, as crypto market volatility remained high to start the week.
 
Following a high of $27,407.02 on Sunday, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $26,712.73 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, the relative strength index (RSI) fell below a recent support point at the 47.00 level.
 

 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
The index is now tracking at 44.43, which is marginally above an upcoming floor at the 43.00 mark.
 
Should bears retreat to this point, there is a strong possibility that BTC could collide with a floor of its own at $26,300.
 
Despite this, there is still some optimism from bulls that a recent upwards cross of moving averages could point to an upcoming shift in momentum.
 

 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also suffered from the day’s volatility, with prices once again moving below $1,900.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,864.17 to start the week, which comes a day after trading at $1,912.21.
 
The decline is the third straight day in which the world’s second largest cryptocurrency has fallen lower.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Should bears continue to control market sentiment, ETH will likely hit a floor at the $1,830 level.
 
Price strength is currently at a reading of 51.57, with a point of support close, at the 51.00 zone.
 
In the event this level is broken, there will likely be an influx of bearish activity.
