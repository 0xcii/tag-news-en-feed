Dixon, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the crypto ratings platform Evai, mentioned in an X post that a weaker consumer price index (CPI) data next week “should awaken the sleeping giant and propel XRP higher.” There is the feeling that the CPI inflation data, set to be released on May 15th, could come in lower than expected, which Dixon believes will be positive for XRP’s price.

The plunge in transaction fees has impacted several operations on the Ethereum network. For instance, according to data from Etherscan, asset swaps can now be executed for just $7.32, bridging at $2.35, and borrowing at $6.21, while NFT minting is priced at roughly $12.37.

Taking to X, the analyst posts several reasons to negate concerns by skeptics even with the coin trading 30% from March 2024 highs when prices broke above $4,000. By this take, doubts about future gains could be unfounded as they paint an overly pessimistic outlook for the second most valuable cryptocurrency.
