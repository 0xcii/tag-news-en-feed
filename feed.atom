I’ve had my share of being hungry and eating two-minute noodles because I couldn’t afford anything else. That’s no fun, but it’s the reality for a lot of people in the Global South. It’s a reality that NoOnes plans to change. 
I want to make a lot of money, and I’m not ashamed to say so. Being really rich would be great, but it wouldn’t feel good if everyone around me was poor. It wouldn’t even feel good if they were moderately successful. The only way it would feel good is if everyone around me is rich, too. That’s the reason one of our values at NoOnes is “everyone eats,” and it’s so important I’ve made it part of our business model.
There is hunger at NoOnes, but it’s a hunger to make sure we are doing everything we can to make…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metaplanet Inc., a publicly traded company based in Tokyo, has made news again with its latest Bitcoin buy. Today, the company revealed that it had bought an extra 21.88 BTC for 200 million yen, which is about $1.26 million at the moment.
 
 
Bitcoin Adoption And More
 
This year, Metaplanet released its Bitcoin for Treasury Asset Policy, which paved the way for smaller companies that want to use digital currencies to do so. Since then, the company has steadily increased its Bitcoin holdings by buying more every two months, even though market conditions have changed.
 
Analysts think that their most recent move, which came at a time when the price of Bitcoin was fluctuating, was a smart one to take advantage of lower prices and increase their long-term gains on investment.
