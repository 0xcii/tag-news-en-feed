        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the existence of the world of crypto, Bitcoin has demonstrated noteworthy performance. Gaining momentum over the past week, the renowned digital currency is poised to mark one of its most robust weeks this year, according to Bloomberg.

This comes amid relative calm in smaller altcoins such as XRP, Cardano, and Solana. This upward trend in Bitcoin’s value is largely driven by whispers of new avenues for mainstream institutional involvement.
