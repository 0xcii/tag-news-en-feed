FTX Founder Faces Intensive Cross-Examination by Prosecutors in Ongoing Trial
 
Prosecutors focused on Sam Bankman-Fried‘s use of the encrypted messaging app Signal, including his enabling of auto-delete features in 2021. Bankman-Fried said he did not seek specific legal approval for auto-deleting messages, but believed it was allowed under FTX’s document retention policy implemented that year. Bankman-Fried’s testimony was recorded by Matthew Russell Lee from the Inner City Press.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin slipped below the $34,000 level earlier in today’s session, ahead of the upcoming consumer sentiment report in the United States. Data on Thursday showed that the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 4.9% in Q3, largely driven by consumer spending. Ethereum moved below the $1,800 level to start the day.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin slipped below the $34,000 mark on Friday, as markets consolidated ahead of U.S. consumer sentiment figures.
 
BTC/USD fell to a low at $33,762.32 earlier in today’s session, which comes following a peak at $34,649.40 the day before.
 
As a result of the decline, bitcoin continued to pull away from a recent 18-month high, as bears began to gradually seize market sentiment.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This comes as the relative strength index (RSI) remained in overbought territory, with a current reading of 83.68.
 
Bulls in the market seem reluctant to let go of their positions, and have gone on to once again push BTC above $34,000.
 
Overall, BTC remains nearly 15% higher than at the same time last week, despite the recent price consolidation.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also edged lower in today’s session, falling below the $1,800 mark in the process.
 
After reaching a high of $1,857.81 on Thursday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,764.01 earlier in the day.
 
This decline has seen ETH snap a seven-day bull run, pushing the cryptocurrency away from a multi-month high in the process.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
The drop coincided with the RSI failing to breach a resistance level of 74.00, and it is now tracking at a reading of 71.13.
 
Traders who are holding onto their long positions may begin to reconsider this, should the index fall below the 70.00 mark.
