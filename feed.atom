OKX Enters Middle East
The newly gained license would allow the global crypto exchange to offer spot services and spot pairs to institutional and qualified retail customers in the Middle East. However, the newly gained license will remain non-operational as the company needs to “fully satisfy all remaining conditions and select localization requirements,” which is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ukrainian police, in collaboration with Europol, recently apprehended the alleged mastermind behind a cryptojacking scheme. According to a statement released by Europol, the arrest underscores why the private sector should collaborate with law enforcement.
 
Law Enforcement and Private Sector Collaboration
 
The Ukrainian police recently arrested a 29-year-old man accused of masterminding a complex cryptojacking scheme. The unnamed man, who was apprehended in Mykolaiv, is believed to have mined cryptocurrencies worth over $2 million using illegally accessed cloud resources.
 
According to a statement released via European Police (Europol), the alleged cryptojacker’s arrest followed months of collaboration between Ukrainian law enforcement, Europol and an unidentified cloud services provider. The statement said the arrest underscores why the private sector should collaborate with law enforcement.
 
Explaining how the probe, which saw law enforcement agents comb three properties associated with the cryptojacker, unfolded, Europol said:
 
“A cloud provider approached Europol back in January 2023 with information regarding compromised cloud user accounts of theirs. Europol shared this information with the Ukrainian authorities, who subsequently opened an investigation.”
 
On the day of the arrest, the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) of the law enforcement agency set up a command post to support the National Police of Ukraine.
 
 
Meanwhile, in the statement, Europol shared some anti-cryptojacking tips that cloud service providers can use to stop criminals from illegally accessing cloud computing infrastructure. One way cloud providers can do this is by having strong access controls in place.
 
Cloud service providers can also block cryptojackers by regularly monitoring cloud environments for suspicious activities and keeping cloud resources updated, the statement added.

This amount represented almost half of the total circulating supply of XRP, which stands at approximately 54.26 billion. The supposed transaction was reported by the highly-regarded blockchain tracking service Whale Alert to have originated from an unknown wallet, destined for the crypto exchange Bitfinex.
 
Subsequent investigations, however, quickly debunked the initial concerns. Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Bitfinex, clarified that the event was not a transaction but an attempted exploit of the “Partial Payments” feature in the XRP Ledger.

In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Georgieva emphasized the distinction between money and crypto assets when discussing cryptocurrencies. 
 
According to Georgieva, crypto should be regarded as an asset class rather than a form of currency. She highlighted the alleged varying levels of security and risk associated with different cryptocurrencies, depending on whether assets back them. Georgieva likened crypto to a money…]]></summary>

While this development signals a mainstream breakthrough for crypto, it also places Coinbase in a spotlight fraught with potential rewards and significant risks.
 
The approval and commencement of the first spot exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have marked a significant moment in BTC’s journey toward mainstream acceptance.
 
 
This move has put Coinbase at the ‘center of action,’ as many spot ETF issuers, including industry giants like BlackRock and Ark Invest, rely on the exchange for essential services such as custodianship, trading, and lending.
