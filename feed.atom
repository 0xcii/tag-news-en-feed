Bitcoin Miners Have Been Depositing Big To OTC Desks Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, BTC miners have been sending coins to over-the-counter (OTC) desks during the past three months.
 
OTC desks are platforms that facilitate a direct transaction between individuals or institutions. Such selling and buying is more discreet than it is on centralized exchanges, so it can be hard to track who is trading on these platforms.
 
 
The analytics firm CryptoQuant, however, has used on-chain data to identify certain addresses that are likely to be associated with OTC desks that miners like to use.

Binance Increases Spending On Compliance
 
The urgency to make these hires stems from Binance’s annual spending on compliance, now over $200 million, which has dramatically surged from just a few million a few years ago—quite an investment toward doing things the right way.

The ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF took in 274 Bitcoin worth around $15 million on August 22nd, its biggest single day of inflows since July 12th. The other two Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs - Bosera Hashkey and Harvest saw no flows today.
Hong Kong approved its first three spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, following the launch of similar products in the U.S. and Europe. The ETFs allow investors to be exposed to Bitcoin prices without having to handle the asset directly.
While Hong Kong's Bitcoin ETF volumes pale compared to those in the U.S., inflows have been steadily climbing. The ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF is the largest of the Hong Kong products, with over $141 million in net assets. Bosera Hashkey and Harvest Bitcoin ETFs have around $99 million and $30 million, respectively, under management.
The total assets under management across the three Hong Kong Spot Bitcoin ETFs is approximately 4,450 BTC worth around $270 million. 
While still modest, the growing inflows indicate increasing bitcoin interest and adoption among Asian institutional investors. As Bitcoin matures into an established asset class, Asian and global investors are seeking regulated exposure through products like spot ETFs.]]></summary>
