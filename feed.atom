Over time, US-based ETFs will become the largest holders of Bitcoin, surpassing even Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious founder of the cryptocurrency. This development certainly also captures how institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space is growing.
 
 
Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas surprised the crypto community with a farfetched prediction in relation to Bitcoin ownership. Balchunas claims that if trends continue, by the end of this year, the world’s most elusive man, Satoshi Nakamoto, will not be holding the largest share of the cryptocurrency. This prediction assumes a dramatic change within the ownership landscape of Bitcoin, with institutional actors gaining ground very fast.
