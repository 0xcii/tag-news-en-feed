Turkey. According to the firm, this is part of its focus on transparency and  
regulatory compliance.

framework to safeguard the ecosystem. To ensure legal compliance in Turkey and  
globally, the company is taking necessary measures.
Binance.com will remain accessible from Turkey. However,  
there will be adjustments to services. The Turkish language option will be  
gradually turned off within three months. Marketing activities for Turkish  
users will be completely halted.

Turkey's new crypto framework is a positive step forward for the industry.At #Binance, we support these developments and will keep collaborating with regulators for a secure, compliant crypto ecosystem.More details here ⤵️ https://t.co/1ueOliKUYd

users. The company assures that user safety and experience remain a priority.  
All user funds are safe, and deposit/withdrawal functions will remain  
available.
