        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australian asset manager Monochrome plans to launch the nation's first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds physical bitcoin.

JUST IN:  🇦🇺 The first #Bitcoin spot ETF in Australia to go live "in 2024," asset manager Monochrome says.
It would be the first Australian ETF to hold $BTC directly. pic.twitter.com/x8nYRNzZra
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 5, 2024
  
  
  
Monochrome filed an application with securities exchange Cboe Australia to list its flagship bitcoin ETF product. The firm expects approval by mid-2024.
Unlike previous bitcoin exchange-traded products in Australia, Monochrome's ETF would hold actual bitcoin. This structure mirrors the highly successful spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has already greenlighted Monochrome's proposal. Cboe Australia is now reviewing the application.
"We anticipate a decision from Cboe Australia about the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF before the middle of 2024," said CEO Jeff Yew. "The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF stands to be the first Bitcoin ETF in Australia authorized to hold Bitcoin directly."
If approved, the ETF would provide local investors with direct exposure to bitcoin through a regulated investment vehicle. Monochrome said it chose Cboe for its strategic expertise and extensive reach across Asia.
The firm had originally planned to list on rival exchange ASX, but it has since pivoted to Cboe's platform.
Australia joining the spot bitcoin ETF movement could further validate Bitcoin as an investable asset class, as Monochrome is aiming to tap surging institutional demand as the Bitcoin industry matures.
The fund's launch would arrive just before Bitcoin's next halving event, likely boosting interest. As the first to hold physical bitcoin, Monochrome could quickly dominate the local ETF space in Australia.]]></summary>

Why 2024 Is A Bullish Year For Bitcoin
 
In a video posted on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Davis revealed that two other events, besides the Bitcoin Halving, will push the bull market even further and cause BTC’S price to keep rising. For the first, he highlighted that the stock market performs positively 83% of the time in an election year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong's financial regulator has issued a warning  
to the public regarding an unlicensed virtual asset trading platform that is  
suspected of marketing services to investors without proper authorization. The Securities and Futures Commission cautioned  
investors against trading on Sure X, highlighting the risks of potential losses  
due to platform failure, hacking, or misappropriation of assets.
Sure X Added to SFC's Alert List
Sure X is a virtual asset trading platform operating  
under various names, including Sure Bit International Pte Ltd / Sure Bit  
International Ltd. The SFC warned that investors might still find ways to  
access Sure X's websites and trading platform despite appearing to be  
inaccessible.
The SFC wrote: "While Sure X's platform websites  
appear to be inaccessible, the SFC notes that Hong Kong investors, through  
other means via the internet, may still be able to access the websites and/or  
the purported trading platform and register as new users."
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

BREAKING: 🇧🇹 Kingdom of Bhutan to increase mining capacity 6x ahead of the #Bitcoin halving to 600 megawatts.
Nation state FOMO is setting in 🙌 pic.twitter.com/kLsU3fGk0U
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 5, 2024
  
  
  
According to Bloomberg, Bhutan's sovereign wealth fund Druk Holding & Investments is partnering with Bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer to ramp up capacity from 100 to 600 megawatts. The country has taken an institutional interest in Bitcoin, with its sovereign fund purchasing BTC since prices were around $5,000.
Bhutan announced last year it was raising $500 million to boost mining operations. By framing mining as both a commercial opportunity and crisis mitigation tool, Bhutan has embraced Bitcoin more fully than most nations. Its renewable hydropower reserves also make it an ideal location for eco-friendly mining.
The new investment in cutting-edge mining hardware comes as the Bitcoin network faces a halving in mid-April. The quadrennial event cuts block rewards for miners in half, impacting revenue.
Bhutan cited offsetting the halving's impact as a motivation for expanding its mining operations. Bitdeer has one of the lowest costs per Bitcoin mined in the industry at $20,000 per coin, far below the global average of up to $45,000.
The remote Himalayan nation has also viewed Bitcoin mining as a way to boost rural economies and jobs.]]></summary>
