        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-up-to-6-week-high-as-avax-jumps-13-on-saturday/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-28T15:03:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin rose to a six-week high on Saturday, as prices rose above a key resistance level to start the weekend. The meme coin climbed to its strongest point since December, as the global crypto market cap was mostly in the green in today’s session. Avalanche also surged today, hitting its strongest point since August.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was one of Saturday’s most notable movers, as prices rose to their highest point in six weeks.
 
Following a low of $0.08507 on Friday, DOGE/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $0.09297 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this, dogecoin moved to its strongest point since December 13, which is the last time prices were trading at a resistance level of $0.0930.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) edged closer to a ceiling at 61.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 59.96, with DOGE trading below earlier highs at a reading of $0.08808.
 
Should DOGE bulls push price strength past the 61.00 mark, it is likely that prices will break out of today’s ceiling at $0.0930.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
Avalanche (AVAX) surged by as much as 14% higher to start the weekend, as prices raced past a long-term point of resistance.
 
AVAX/USD jumped to a high of $21.68 earlier in the day, which comes less than a day after falling to a low of $17.83.
 
Today’s rally has seen avalanche rise to its highest level since August 26, cementing a five-month high in the process.
 
 
Earlier gains have already begun to fade, with previous bulls seemingly opting to close positions and secure profits.
 
This decline has resulted in the RSI finding its floor, with price strength now tracking at 70.35, which is marginally above its support at 70.00.
 
Should this decline continue, it is a strong possibility that AVAX could fall towards a floor at $18.50.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the weekend hovering near $23,000, as markets continued to react to personal consumption data in the United States. Figures released on Friday reported that spending fell by 0.2% last month, despite overall consumer sentiment moving higher. Ethereum remained close to $1,600 to start the day.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) remained close to the $23,000 level on Saturday, as markets continued to react to Friday’s U.S. personal consumption data.
 
Following a high of $23,417.72 late on Friday, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $22,880.60 earlier in the day.
 
This came as bitcoin was once again unable to break out of a key resistance level at $23,500, leading to a resurgence of bearish sentiment.
 
 
In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has dropped below the 80.00 mark, and looks to be headed for a floor at 76.00
 
Should momentum continue in a downward direction, it is likely that BTC will collide with a floor at $22,400.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 78.59, with BTC/USD trading at $22,930.60.
 
 
Ethereum
 
After a brief stint moving back above $1,600 late on Friday, ethereum (ETH) started the weekend once again below this level.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,568.69 on Saturday, less than a day after hitting a peak of $1,617.00.
 
Volatility in ethereum has been heightened in recent days, following a failed breakout attempt of the $1,645 level earlier this week.
 
 
Following weeks of being overbought, price strength has begun to decline, with the 14-day RSI now tracking below its floor at 63.00
 
As of writing, the index is at a reading of 62.50, with ethereum at $1,582, with a floor at $1,550 a possible target for sellers.
