In a pioneering approach, the responsibility has been put on a network of churches under the leadership of Pastor Blake Bush at the Colorado House of Prayer. It’s an unusual way to gather $2.5 million for investment through a digital asset called “Stone Coin” and encourage each community member toward investment for its future.
 
A Divine Inspiration?
 
Pastor Bush claims his plan to tokenize the church simply materialized after a spiritual experience. He claims the voice of God simply told him to “tokenize the building.”
