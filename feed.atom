His statement comes in response to a community poll debating budget allocations for two competing proposals, revealing his strategic vision for enhancing Cardano’s competitiveness.
 
ADA Faster Than SOL? 
 
The poll in question asked the wider community to choose between funding a Rust node request or implementing a new feature called Leios. Hoskinson pointed out that while the Rust node would provide no differentiation for users, the Leios upgrade promises to increase Cardano’s speed without compromising its decentralization.

Bitcoin Exchange Depositing Addresses Now At Lowest Since 2016
 
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Exchange Depositing Addresses metric has plunged recently. The “Exchange Depositing Addresses” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total number of unique addresses making inflow transactions to exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means many users are making transactions to wallets associated with centralized exchanges. As one of the main reasons investors may deposit to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this trend can have a bearish impact on the asset.
