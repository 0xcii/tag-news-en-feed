UK and CEO of Bifinity, has left the company. This departure comes against the

Farnell joined Binance in May 2021 and assumed the  
role of CEO of Eqonex, the holding company of the crypto custodian Digivault,  
in 2022. This move was in accordance with a loan agreement, which granted  
Binance the authority to appoint a CEO from within Bifinity, Coindesk reported.

in finance have created as much talk and excitement as Bitcoin. This  
cryptocurrency has evolved from a tiny digital experiment to a global financial  
phenomenon since its launch in 2009. However, many people are wondering whether

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rallied to its highest level since May 2022, as bullish sentiment exploded throughout the market. The surge came as traders believed a United States SEC announcement was imminent, over a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), likely from Blackrock. Ethereum also rose, climbing above $1,800.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin bulls pushed the cryptocurrency over the $35,000 level on Tuesday, as momentum over a potential ETF approval intensified.
 
Following a low of $30,433.32 to start the week, BTC/USD surged to a peak at $35,150.43 earlier in the day.
 
This resulted in bitcoin climbing to its highest level since May 7, 2022, when the price was trading above $36,000.
 
 
Earlier gains have somewhat eased due to several factors, one of which being the relative strength index (RSI) moving deep into overbought territory.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at the 88.60 mark, which is its strongest reading since the start of the year.
 
BTC is now trading at $34,528.51, as traders have likely started closing off positions, in order to secure profits.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) reached $1,800 for the first time in several months, after being the beneficiary of general sentiment around crypto.
 
ETH/USD rallied to an intraday high of $1,845.99 earlier in today’s session, a day after trading at a bottom at $1,664.58.
 
As a result of today’s peak, ethereum reached its highest point since August 13, when price was marginally below $1,860.
 
 
The move saw ethereum climb for a fifth straight session, which came as the RSI broke out of a resistance at 60.00.
 
Similar to bitcoin, price strength in ETH is now severely overbought, with the index now tracking at 76.79.
 
Bulls broke a ceiling of 68.00 over the last several hours, however it is unlikely that this will be sustained, as profit takers begin to loom.

This has further raised speculations as to the possibility of a Spot Bitcoin ETF launching soon. 
 
How Seeding Suggests An Approval Is Imminent
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas mentioned that BlackRock’s amendment about seeding is noteworthy because it wasn’t in the original filing. However, he doesn’t want to read so much meaning into it. 
 
 
As to what seeding means and how it is a positive sign for the crypto community, Balchunas explained that seeding an ETF is when “initial funding” is provided to purchase a “few creation units,” which in this case would m…]]></summary>
