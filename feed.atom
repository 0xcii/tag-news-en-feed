        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-extends-declines-on-thursday-falling-by-nearly-9/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-06T15:27:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was one of Thursday’s biggest movers, as the meme coin fell by as much as 9%. The decline comes as market sentiment begins to shift, following huge gains to start the week. Litecoin was also in the red today, with prices hovering near the $90.00 level.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) fell for a third consecutive session on Thursday, as market sentiment shifted bearish, following strong gains to start the week.
 
DOGE/USD dropped to a low of $0.08857 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24-hours after trading at a high of $0.09804.
 
The meme coin rose to a four-month high earlier in the week, after Twitter changed its logo to a cartoon image of Doge.
 
 
Since then, traders have appeared to abandon earlier long positions, instead opting to secure profits.
 
As a result of this latest decline in price, the relative strength index (RSI) has now fallen below a long-term floor at 60.00.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 59.59, with a strong chance of further declines.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Another notable mover on Thursday was litecoin (LTC), which fell towards the $90.00 level.
 
Following a high of $94.44 in yesterday’s session, LTC/USD dropped to a bottom at $90.22 earlier in the day.
 
Overall, it appears that this decline was a result of upwards momentum easing, as the token approached a key price point of $95.00.
 
 
In addition to this, the RSI also failed to break out of its own ceiling at 57.00, giving way to a resurgence of bearish activity.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 52.26, which is the weakest point for the index since March 31.
 
A floor at 51.00 is seemingly the target for bears, and should the point be reached, there is a good chance that LTC will be below $90.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was once again trading below $28,000, as markets consolidated ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls report. Payrolls are expected to come in at 240,000 for last month, with the unemployment rate in the U.S. remaining at 3.6%. Ethereum was also lower today, following an eight-month high on Wednesday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was once again trading under $28,000 on Thursday, as markets began to prepare for tomorrow’s non-farm payrolls report.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,831.56 in today’s session, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $28,714.22.
 
The move came as bitcoin bulls were unable to sustain a breakout of a key resistance level of $28,500.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this latest drop in price came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) dropped below a floor of 58.00.
 
As of writing this, the index is now tracking at 57.80, with the 10-day (red) moving average nearing a downwards cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should sentiment remain bearish, there is a strong possibility that BTC will fall to a floor at $27,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also lower in today’s session, as prices slipped from an eight-month high the day prior.
 
Following a high of $1,924.47 on Wednesday, ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,859.00 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this decline, ethereum has fallen from its strongest point since Aug. 17, when the price hit a peak of $1,957.
 
 
Similar to bitcoin, today’s drop came as a result of the the RSI hovering below a recent support point at 61.00.
 
Overall, it appears that earlier bulls have moved to take profits, ahead of the upcoming uncertainty in the market.
 
At the time of writing, ethereum is trading at $1,871.63.

This is an opinion editorial by Mickey Koss, a West Point graduate with a degree in economics. He spent four years in the infantry before transitioning to the Finance Corps.
The demand for tokenizing assets like real estate is not a solution to, but rather a symptom of, the problems that bad money perpetuates. Real estate should be reduced to its utility value as a dwelling or place of business, rather than used as a store of value by proxy if we ever hope to solve the growing gap in wealth inequality.
