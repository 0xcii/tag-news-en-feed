This erroneous message from the official Twitter of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sparked a rapid increase in bitcoin’s price, soaring close to $48,000 per unit. Yet, this surge was short-lived as the price promptly dropped to around $45,000 once the market recognized the false nature of the announcement.

Long points to the recent news that Ark Invest, one of the multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applicants, is offering a fee of 0.25%. The decision to further slash fees follows BlackRock’s move to drop theirs to as low as 0.30%.

The former SEC chairman joined CNBC on its famous ‘Squawk Box’ show where he shared his expectations for the 13 pending Bitcoin Spot ETF applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

encountered a significant stir as its Twitter account appeared to announce  
approvals for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) prematurely. 
However, contrary to the tweet's assertion, SEC  
Chair Gary Gensler confirmed that no spot Bitcoin ETF applications had received  
approval as of Tuesday afternoon. The regulator's official statement debunked  
the tweet due to an account compromise, underscoring that the SEC had not  
endorsed the listing or trading of such ETFs.

The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.

Despite this incident, expectations loom for the  
SEC's future approval of spot Bitcoin ETF applications, though no such approval  
had transpired by the time of the compromised tweet. 
The SEC's Statement
Gensler took to his Twitter account to clarify the  
misunderstanding, affirming the lack of authorization to spot Bitcoin ETFs. The  
SEC's spokesperson echoed this sentiment via email, categorically denying the  
legitimacy of the tweet that circulated misinformation regarding Bitcoin ETF  
approvals.
Similarly, the SEC's Twitter account highlighted the fuss caused by the manipulated announcement about approving the Bitcoin ETFs. Its official statement, arising from a compromised account, firmly stated that the SEC didn't support or approve the trading or listing of these ETFs.

This confirmation from FOX Business cements earlier speculations, affirming that the final green light for Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been granted, signaling an imminent leap into the regulated investment sphere for Bitcoin.
The potential commencement of trading on Thursday would mark a watershed moment for the Bitcoin industry, providing a gateway for both institutional and retail investors to access BTC exposure through traditional financial instruments.
It is important to note that the SEC has not yet officially approved any spot Bitcoin ETFs at the time of writing. But with the approval or denial decision due tomorrow, it is expected by industry experts that the ETFs will be approved.
As the countdown begins towards tomorrows expected approval and Thursdays potential launch, anticipation builds among market participants, eager to witness this historic milestone that is poised to reshape the dynamics of Bitcoin investments and potentially pave the way for further institutional adoption of Bitcoin.]]></summary>
