        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) recently achieved a significant milestone by reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 on March 14th. This surge was primarily attributed to the booming Bitcoin ETF market, which substantially impacted the cryptocurrency’s price. 
 
However, following this new ATH, BTC has experienced a significant price correction, hitting a low of $60,900 on Tuesday, March 19th. The main factors contributing to this downturn are the increased selling activity of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and a decline in demand for the new investment vehicles approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10th.

These include conservative think tanks, fossil fuel lobbyists, and climate change skeptics, casting a shadow on the Bitcoin community’s claims of moving towards sustainability.

However, after 20 years of ever tighter (and ever more expensive) AML regulations, the levels of organized crime, tax evasion, or drug use do not show any signs of decrease. At the same time, the basic right to privacy is being unceremoniously violated on an everyday basis, with each financial operation, no matter how tiny, being subject to extensive verifications and tons of paperwork.

The primary discussion has been the number of years the defendant could get, with his lawyers recently arguing that the prosecution’s proposed sentence of 50 years is unfair. 
 
Sam Bankman-Fried Getting 50 Years Is “Not Justice”
 
In a letter addressed to Judge Lewis Kaplan, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers criticized the government’s memorandum, in which they proposed that SBF be sentenced to 40 to 50 years. They further mentioned that the prosecution is adopting a “medieval view of punishment to reach what amounts to a death-in-prison sentencing recommendation.”
