        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Statistics recorded on April 15, 2023, show that the number of coins in circulation for the stablecoin BUSD dropped below the 7 billion range to 6.68 billion, marking the lowest number of BUSD in circulation since April 2021. Furthermore, data indicates that the supply of BUSD has shrunk by 19.8% over the past 30 days.
 
BUSD Stablecoin Supply Hits Lowest Point in Two Years
 
BUSD, which was once among the largest stablecoins, remains the third-largest USD-pegged token. However, on February 13, 2023, Paxos announced that the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) had directed the company to stop issuing BUSD. On that day, around 16.1 billion BUSD tokens were in circulation, and since then, 9.42 billion stablecoins have been redeemed.

There is still a long way to go before AI can fully take over and render many people unemployed. However, this booming technology has what it takes to do so.
 
This article will investigate the factors at play here.
 
 
Will Artificial Intelligence Make Humans Jobless?
 
It is essential to keep in mind that artificial intelligence will never be able to fully replace humans in the workforce. Instead, AI is a resource that can make people better at what they already do.

This is an opinion editorial by Luke Groom, a civil engineer, JD-MBA student and part-time strategy associate with Marathon Digital Holdings.
In the last couple of years, Jordan Peterson has been diving down the sound money rabbit hole, and for me it’s been a pleasure to watch from a distance. So many of the values he espouses align with the values that Bitcoin encourages, such as personal responsibility and a search for truth, so it was only a matter of time before he became interested in Bitcoin.

Arbitrum, the largest Layer 2 network by TVL, is now governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which voted largely against AIP-1.05. According to certain reports, some governance token holders saw the proposal as too unrealistic and ‘myopic’.
