Bitcoin Miners Have Made A Profit Of 37% On Their Total Investment
 
In a recent tweet, Glassnode posted the latest data on where the miners currently stand regarding their revenue, cost, and profit. First, to calculate the revenue of these chain validators, the analytics firm has taken the sum of the “thermocap” and the transaction fees that this cohort has earned throughout their lifetime.
 
The thermocap is an indicator that measures the cumulative sum of the issuance multiplied by the spot price of Bitcoin. In simpler terms, this metric tells us the total value of the block rewards that the miners have earned over the network’s lifetime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The lawsuit alleges the company collected detailed face maps and fingerprints of customers without consent.
Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Inc. is facing a class-action lawsuit for allegedly collecting face templates and fingerprints of its customers without their consent, in violation of Illinois' new biometric privacy law. 
The suit, which was filed in federal court in San Francisco, claims that Coinbase harvests facial data from IDs and selfies that customers upload.
As reported by Bloomberg, the company also harvests fingerprint data when customers log into their accounts using the required fingerprint scanning technology. The company's collection and storage of this data exposes users to "serious and irreversible privacy risks,” according to the lawsuit.
The case highlights the growing concern over data privacy and the need for companies to be transparent about how they collect and use user data, especially sensitive biometric information such as facial recognition and fingerprint data. 
As more companies collect and store biometric data, it's likely that lawsuits like this will become more common, underscoring the importance of strong data privacy practices that work to prevent the misappropriation of such sensitive information in the first place.
While Bitcoin is an inherently transparent database, and many of the onramps that are most often used to buy and sell bitcoin require full KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance, there are steps that Bitcoin users can take to minimize leaks of private data.]]></summary>

The utility has temporarily held all new large-scale, short-notice requests for electricity and new requests from cryptocurrency miners due to the “significant pressure” they put on the province’s electricity supply.

cryptocurrency derivatives exchange days after disclosing that it was going  
offshore with a Bermuda license. The US-based digital asset exchange said the new  
platform is only open to only eligible, non-US institutional traders. 
Coinbase and Gemini Launch New Platforms
The new platform on  
Tuesday listed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) perpetual futures contracts,  
Coinbase said in a blog post, adding that the platform currently only offers 5x  
leverage, with all trades settled in stablecoin USD Coin (USD).

        <updated>2023-05-02T15:45:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polkadot was one of Tuesday’s biggest movers, as the token dropped to a six-week low in today’s session. Prices fell for a long-term support point of $5.60, as the global crypto market cap was once again 1% lower today. Avalanche also hit a price floor on Tuesday.
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) was down for a second straight session on Tuesday, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remained bearish.
 
DOT/USD dropped to a low of $5.61 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $5.82.
 
As a result of the move, polkadot slipped to its weakest point since March 12, when price was trading at $5.47.
 
 
Today’s decline saw DOT near a floor at $5.60, with bulls so far rejecting a breakout below this point.
 
At the time of writing, the token is trading at $5.68, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped from a floor of its own.
 
The index rebounded from a floor at 36.00, and as of writing, is tracking at 37.52.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
In addition to DOT, Avalanche (AVAX) was another notable mover on Tuesday, as the token fell to its own level of support.
 
Following a high of $17.06 to start the week, AVAX/USD sunk to a bottom at $16.53 earlier today.
 
Tuesday’s decline saw bears attempt to take avalanche to a long-term price floor at $16.30, however they were unsuccessful, thus far.
 
 
Looking at the chart, and similar to what occurred with DOT, the breakout was rejected as the RSI remained above a floor of 41.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 41.27, with a ceiling of 43.00 a possible target for bulls looking to extend the current rebound.
 
Should this occur, there is a chance that AVAX could reach $17.00

Now Marco Santori, the company's chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
