        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a rapidly evolving global landscape, where nations are vying for dominance in the Bitcoin mining sector, Oman has emerged as a dark horse with its ambitious plans. The nation aims to capture a staggering 7% of the global Bitcoin hash rate by June 2025. This is not just a lofty goal; it’s backed by data presented by Bitcoin mining expert Jaran Mellerud in his latest report.
 
Oman, traditionally an oil-centric economy, is located on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. It shares borders with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Historically, Oman has been the 6th largest oil producer per capita globally. However, the winds of change are blowing, and Oman is shifting its focus to Bitcoin mining.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-volatility-returns-to-btc-eth-during-fridays-session/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-08T12:48:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After price climbing above the $26,000 level earlier in the day, bitcoin bulls have retreated from earlier positions, sending prices lower in the process. The decline comes after price collided with a key resistance point. Ethereum has also slipped, after moving closer to $1,700.
 
Bitcoin
 
Volatility was back in cryptocurrency markets on Friday, as bitcoin (BTC) bulls pushed price above the $26,000 level.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $26,414.01 earlier in today’s session, however this was short lived, as price now sits at $25,795.12.
 
Today’s move was the highest BTC has hit since last Thursday, and came following a breakout of a ceiling at $26,400.

Looking at the chart, previous bulls seem to have immediately liquidated their positions after price moved beyond this point.
 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) also hit a resistance level of its own at 45.00, before retreating to a current reading at 39.18.
 
Overall, this drop shows that market sentiment remains bearish, despite the slight spark seen earlier in the day.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also edged higher during Friday’s session, with bulls pushing price closer to the $1,700 level.
 
After trading at a low of $1,617.80 on Thursday, ETH/USD rallied to an intraday high of $1,657.30 earlier in the day.
 
Similar to bitcoin above, gains have since faded, with the world’s second largest cryptocurrency now trading at $1,626.05.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
A failed move beyond a resistance zone of 40.00 seems to be one reason for the reversal, with the RSI now tracking at 37.41.
 
Should momentum continue to slip, a floor of 35.00 could provide a stable base, and if this fails, ETH could slip under $1,600.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Australian cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx has said it will offer financial rewards to users who complete its crypto education course. The crypto exchange said it expects as many as 80,000 participants and has promised a reward of just over $64 for those completing the course. 
 
Improving the Public’s Knowledge and Understanding of Cryptocurrencies
 
An Australian cryptocurrency exchange, Swyftx, said it plans to financially reward users who participate and complete learning courses offered via its crypto education platform. Known as “Earn and Learn,” the platform, which was formally launched on Sept. 6, represents the crypto exchange’s attempt to improve the public’s knowledge and understanding of cryptocurrencies.
 
According to a recent report, Swyftx’s courses will cover different cryptocurrency scams and how users can identify them. Tom Matthews, who heads the crypto exchange’s corporate affairs, said the educational initiative also seeks to make users tough targets for scammers.
 

 
As recently reported by Bitcoin.com News, cybercriminals are thought to have stolen nearly $1 billion via scams, rug pulls and exploits in just the first eight months of 2023. Criminals are believed to have used the same modus operandi to steal close to $46 million in the month of August alone.
 
Therefore, in order to help users avoid falling for similar crypto scams or compromised projects, Swyftx said its educational courses will include a checklist for evaluating tokens and crypto projects.
 
For users who complete the course, Swyftx is promising a reward of just over $64 (AUD100) while those who complete the initial fundamental analysis course will receive $3.2 worth of BTC. The crypto exchange reportedly said it is expecting as many as 80,000 participants.

In a recent strategy session, Nicholas Merten, the popular host of DataDash, cautioned that cryptocurrencies and FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) could experience lackluster gains over the next few years.
 
Merten’s prognosis encompasses not only digital currencies like Bitcoin but also the broader altcoin space, which has historically seen exponential growth. He attributes this potential underperformance to several factors, with one key element being the contraction of market liquidity.

        <updated>2023-09-08T10:42:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A court in Turkey has sentenced Faruk Fatih Özer, the Founder of the collapsed Turkish crypto exchange, Thodex, his sister, Serap Özer, and his brother, Güven Özer to 11,196 years, 10 months and 15 days in prison, according to Coindesk. Further, they are facing a judicial penalty of 135 million liras (about $5 million).  

Thodex's CEO Goes to Jail
It was part of an extensive trial of 21 defendants facing up to 40,564 years in prison. On Thursday, the Anatolian 9th Heavy Penal Court acquitted 16 defendants and released another four due to a lack of evidence. The rest of the defendants faced varying sentencing for the charges set against them.  

Thodex was the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Turkey until the exchange suddenly went offline in April 2021. Özer immediately went missing, but the authorities arrested his brother, sister, and four other senior employees and detailed at least 83 other people.  

The exchange had around 400,000 clients when it shuttered, out of which 390,000 were actively trading cryptocurrencies. Before going offline, the exchange was handling crypto trading volumes of more than $585 million, according to CoinMarketCap.com data. It was estimated to be holding cryptocurrency deposits of about $2 billion.   

Serious Charges against Thodex CEO  

Özer was later arrested in Albania in August 2022 after an Interpol red notice was issued against him. He was extradited to Turkey last April over seven charges, including creating and running a criminal organization, being part of a criminal organization, cheating by using information systems as a tool of banks or credit institutions, deceiving merchants or company executives and cooperative managers, and hiding the value of assets that come from crime.  

He was further sentenced to seven months and 15 days in prison in July for failing to submit certain documents demanded by the Turkish Tax Inspection Board, Finance Magnates earlier reported.
