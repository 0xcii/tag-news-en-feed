        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano rose to a fresh multi-month high on Saturday, as the token surged for a ninth consecutive session. The price is now up by over 15% in that time, cementing its place as the world’s seventh-largest cryptocurrency. Avalanche is also trading higher, hitting a two-month high in the process. 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) once again extended a recent bull run, with the token climbing for a ninth straight day.
 
Following a low of $0.4274 during Friday’s session, ADA/USD rose by as much as 5% today, hitting a peak of $0.4581 in the process.
 
Saturday’s surge has sent ADA to its highest level since September 27, when the price was above $0.4600.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the latest rise in price coincides with the relative strength index (RSI) moving past a key ceiling.
 
The aforementioned point of resistance was at the 72.00 mark, with the index currently tracking at 75.92.
 
Should price strength continue to move higher, an upcoming wall at the 80.00 mark could be a potential stumbling block.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
In addition to ADA, avalanche (AVAX), was another notable gainer in the market to start the weekend.
 
AVAX/USD rallied to an intraday high of $19.51 on Saturday, a day after trading at a low of $18.52.
 
Similar to cardano, today’s move has sent avalanche to a multi-month high, with the token hitting its strongest point since February.
 
 
Overall, AVAX is currently on a seven-day winning streak, which was extended following a breakout of a ceiling at $18.50.
 
Price strength is now at a reading of 66.54, with an upcoming resistance point at the 70.00 mark.
 
Should it reach this target, there is a strong possibility that AVAX will be trading above $20.00.

Bitcoin Difficulty Adjusted Puell Multiple Is Yet To Break Above 1
 
According to a researcher at the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, miners are still earning around 12% less than the average for the past year. The indicator of interest here is the “puell multiple,” which measures the ratio between the daily Bitcoin miner revenue (in USD) and 365-day moving average (MA) of the same.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than one, it means the miners are currently making more than their average for the past year. During such periods, miners generally find mining to be profitable.

Following this week’s gains, traders have seemingly started to secure gains, with the global market cap down by 0.52% as of writing this. Bitcoin has fallen below yesterday’s peak above $31,000.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved back below the $31,000 level on Saturday, as cryptocurrency markets consolidated to start the weekend.
 
Following a high of $31,005.61 on Friday, BTC/USD dropped to a low of $30,044.50 earlier in today’s session.
 
Yesterday’s peak saw bitcoin climb to its highest level since June 7, which has seemingly prompted bulls to secure gains.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the decline in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a ceiling at 71.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 70.18, which is marginally higher than a floor at 68.00.
 
In the event the RSI drops below 70.00 there is a good chance that even more bulls could vacate earlier positions, in order to protect recent profits.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Although relatively lower than Friday’s high, ethereum (ETH) continued above $2,100 so far in Saturday’s session.
 
ETH/USD fell to an intraday bottom at $2,049.08 earlier in the day, however, has since recovered and is currently trading at $2,103.18.
 
This is marginally lower than yesterday’s peak of $2,120.59, which saw ETH trade at its strongest point since last May.
 
 
Similar to bitcoin, ethereum, which is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, has collided with a ceiling on the RSI indicator.
 
The aforementioned point of resistance at 75.00 was hit on Friday, with the index now tracking at 74.88.
 
Should ethereum bulls move beyond this point, there is a possibility that prices could head closer to $2,200 this weekend.
