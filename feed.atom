        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warning of a difficult time ahead for the crypto market, global investment bank JPMorgan has downgraded Coinbase stock. Emphasizing that crypto prices are already under pressure, JPMorgan warned of “greater potential for cryptocurrency ETF enthusiasm to further deflate,” driving with it lower crypto prices and trading volume.
 
JPMorgan’s Crypto Market Outlook, Coinbase’s Downgrade
 
Global investment bank JPMorgan downgraded Coinbase Global (Nasdaq: COIN) from Neutral to Underweight on Monday with a price target of $80. At the time of writing, Coinbase is trading at $123.43, down 28% over the past month. JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington explained in a note Monday:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has  
revealed that the unauthorized post about approving spot  
Bitcoin ETFs on January 9 was related to a "SIM swap" attack. 
This tactic involves transferring a mobile phone  
number to a different device without the owner's consent. The US securities  
watchdog clarified that the attack occurred via the telecommunications carrier  
rather than through its internal systems, emphasizing that its core systems  
were never compromised.
The misleading post, which declared the green light  
for the first bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), caused a frenzy in the  
cryptocurrency sector. However, the SEC was quick to dismiss the post,  
attributing it to a hacker who had gained control of the mobile phone number  
linked to the account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to an announcement from the publicly-listed bitcoin miner Iris Energy, the mining operation has increased its operating capacity to 6 exahash per second (EH/s) and expects an additional 4 EH/s to be online by the first half of 2024.
 
Iris Boosts Mining Capacity to 6 EH/s Amidst IREN Share Dip
 
​​The announcement on Tuesday from Iris Energy (Nasdaq: IREN) highlighted the growth of its mining operations to 6 EH/s, following the deployment of new mining hardware. Over the last six months, Iris has reported several purchases of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining rigs.
 
Notably, in October 2023, the company disclosed the acquisition of Bitmain S21 Antminers worth $19.6 million. This was followed in November by the purchase of 7,000 T21 Antminers from the ASIC manufacturer.
 
Additionally, in December, Iris announced the acquisition of another 8,380 T21 Antminers from Bitmain. Iris Energy is projecting an increase in its mining operations, expecting an additional 4 exahash per second (EH/s) to become operational by the end of the first half of 2024.
 
 
The company also emphasized its trajectory towards achieving a 20 EH/s target by the latter half of 2024. This ambitious goal comes on the heels of a significant acquisition – a purchase and fixed price option agreement for an extra 10 EH/s of Bitmain T21 miners.
 
 
Shares of IREN have not performed as strongly as they did in 2023, experiencing a notable decline of 47.2% against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year. A recent analysis by theminermag.com reveals that publicly-listed mining companies have seen a reduction in value, amounting to $6 billion, since the year’s commencement.
 
What do you think about Iris expanding its hashrate by adding 6 EH/s of hashpower? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.]]></summary>

In other words, Bitcoin is censorship resistant. There is a very good reason that the phrase “censorship resistant” is the wording you hear whenever this topic comes up, not “censorship proof.” Any individual miner can censor whatever they want, in the sense that they can refuse to include something in any block they mine themselves. They cannot, however, prevent other miners from including that transaction in their own blocks whenever they find one.
