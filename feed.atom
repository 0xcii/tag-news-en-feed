        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), both parties submitted a schedule for discovery and briefing to Judge Torres yesterday. However, pro-XRP attorney Jeremy Hogan has pointed out another very interesting development via X.
 
In his latest remarks, Hogan has drawn attention to a strategic precedent that could benefit Ripple, citing the Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. case adjudicated by the US Supreme Court. Hogan noted, “BTW, if you are rooting for Ripple. Throw a big KISS at Changpeng Zhao and Binance for their win last year in the Anderson v. Binance case which really restricted the reach of US securities laws outside of the US. The case helps Ripple out a lot. Legal nerd stuff below.”

The world you live in was never disenchanted. The curse of disenchantment, otherwise known as the Age of Reason, achieved only a confusion of the sacred and profane. One particular manifestation is that all popular entertainments and media have their roots in shamanism, ritual, and divination. The fact that theater originated in sorcery, though broadly unfamiliar to the public, is well known in academia. In Phyllis Hartnoll’s A Concise History of the Theater (1971): “The origins of the theater go back far into the past, to the religious rites of the earliest communities.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/poloniex-hit-by-114-million-hot-wallet-heist-justin-sun-pledges-to-recover-funds/"/>
        <updated>2023-11-10T13:29:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Onchain data and reports have highlighted unusual outflows from cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, prompting concerns of a possible hot wallet breach worth approximately $114 million. Justin Sun, the exchange’s proprietor and Tron’s creator, has stated that the incident is under investigation.
 
Poloniex’s Hot Wallets Breached in $114M Hack
 
The breach at the centralized digital currency platform Poloniex, which occurred on Friday, November 10, 2023, involved a suspected loss of $114 million, as noted by onchain analysts. Cyvers, a team that provides real-time blockchain security alerts, issued a warning: “Red Code: Hey Poloniex [and] Poloniex Support, you better contact us as soon as possible,” they alerted.
 
In response to the event, Poloniex announced on the social media platform X that it had temporarily disabled its wallet system. “Our wallet has been disabled for maintenance,” Poloniex stated. “We will update this thread once the wallet has been re-enabled.”
 
 
While the estimated losses currently stand at $114 million, the impact on a considerable number of hot wallets suggests that the total could be higher. Justin Sun informed the crypto community through the social media platform X about the breach, assuring them of Poloniex’s commitment to rectify the situation.
 
“We are currently investigating the Poloniex hack incident,” Sun wrote. “Poloniex maintains a healthy financial position and will fully reimburse the affected funds. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities for collaboration with other exchanges to facilitate the recovery of these funds.” Sun further added that a bounty was created, stating:
 

We are offering a 5% white hat bounty to the Poloniex hacker. Please return the funds to the following ETH/TRX/BTC wallets. We will give you 7 days to consider this offer before we engage law enforcement.
