        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Founders Fund, the venture capital firm founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, has invested $100 million in bitcoin, sources exclusively informed Reuters. The firm allocated $200 million to acquire Bitcoin and another cryptocurrency, evenly split between the two. This maneuver further highlights the return of institutional investors to Bitcoin.
Founders Fund, an early institutional investor in bitcoin, initially bought BTC in 2014 but liquidated its holdings before the 2022 crash, earning approximately $1.8 billion. The firm resumed its bitcoin investments last summer, strategically acquiring bitcoin and another cryptocurrency when price was below $30,000.
Thiel, known for his libertarian views and co-founding PayPal and Palantir, has publicly endorsed bitcoin, praising its attributes as a store of value and hedge against central bank policies. With assets exceeding $12 billion under management, Founders Fund continues to expand its investment portfolio, with a renewed focus on crypto ventures.
This resurgence comes after a challenging period for the Bitcoin market in 2022, marked by the collapse of major players like crypto exchange FTX. Despite bitcoin's price plunging to nearly $15,000, its lowest since 2020, the Bitcoin market has seen a gradual recovery, with bitcoin recently hitting $50,000 for the first time in over two years, albeit still below its peak of $69,000 in November 2021.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sentencing of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, also known as “CZ,” on a money laundering rule charge has been delayed until April 30, a notice in Seattle federal court disclosed.
 
This two-month postponement comes after Zhao, a Canadian national and former Binance CEO, pleaded guilty on Nov. 21 to a charge of failure to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.
 
 
Harsher Sentence For Former Binance Boss?
 
The delay in sentencing, which was originally scheduled for Feb. 23, has raised questions about the potential factors contributing to this decision.
 
Federal sentencing guidelines suggest a maximum sentence of 18 months in prison for Zhao, but prosecutors have reportedly considered seeking a harsher sentence.

Traditionally, institutional and enterprise investors, whether acquiring bitcoin itself or its derivatives, have turned to large, publicly-traded custodians to manage their bitcoin. Relying on a single custodian both nullifies most of the asset’s benefits while increasing risk of catastrophic loss that has been all too common throughout Bitcoin’s history.
