        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world of cryptocurrency has been shaken once again by the latest report from the Wall Street Journal. According to their sources, Binance – the biggest player in the industry – has been developing a strategy to evade the risk of facing prosecution by U.S. authorities.
 
In a daring move, the company established a U.S. entity back in 2019, as a means of mitigating the potential legal consequences of operating in the United States.
 
 
It seems that the exchange has been operating on thin ice, and the threat of being pursued by U.S. regulators has been looming over them for quite some time.
 
The Wall Street Journal’s report implies that the crypto exchange’s actions could be seen as a sign of desperation, a last-ditch attempt to avoid the long arm of the law.

While the dollar index (DXY) weakened on Friday and the world’s largest stock index, the S&P 500, showed a strong recovery, Bitcoin and crypto headed south.
 
But despite this brief decoupling of Bitcoin from macro action, investors should keep an eye on key dates this week. If the rally in the stock market continues, Bitcoin may want to follow suit and make up the ground lost in the last few weeks.
 
Economic Data That Will Be Important For Bitcoin And Crypto
 
The state of the U.S. labor market and not one but two speeches from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell will be the most important macro factors for the Bitcoin price this week.

In traditional financial markets, the term trading strategy describes a comprehensive plan covering all trading activities, guiding investors to execute their target trades. In the world of crypto, a trading strategy refers to a predetermined plan or trading behavior designed to help investors profit from buying or selling cryptos in both long and short markets.
 
Although not necessary for all types of crypto trading, a sound trading strategy can help investors mitigate potential risks. During extreme market conditions, an effective trading strategy enables crypto users to take prompt countermeasures and minimize their losses.
