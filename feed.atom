Its decentralized nature and potential for economic disruption have caught the attention of many, including Mexican businessman Ricardo Salinas. Salinas, a prominent advocate for economic empowerment in developing nations, believes that Bitcoin has the power to level the playing field and create opportunities for those who have traditionally been excluded from the global financial system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent weeks, the Salvadoran media has been abuzz with speculation that Bitcoin Country President Nayib Bukele will step down from his current role to pursue a second term in office. This move hinges on obtaining a special license from the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly, a process that requires three-quarters approval from the body. Previously, it was widely believed that Salvadoran presidents were limited to a single five-year term. However, a landmark Supreme Court ruling has opened the door to the possibility of a second term, provided the incumbent steps down at least six months before the next presidential term commences on June 1, 2024.

The Supreme Court's ruling introduced a nuanced framework for seeking a second presidential mandate in El Salvador. â€¦]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-23T18:33:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Renowned financial educator and author of the best-selling book "Rich Dad Poor Dad," Robert Kiyosaki, has once again made a bold prediction regarding the future of Bitcoin, suggesting that the cryptocurrency's price is on a trajectory to reach $130,000.Â 
Kiyosaki's pronouncementÂ on X comes amid his growing concerns about inflation and a shifting global economic landscape.
In a recent tweet, Kiyosaki shared his insights on various assets, including Bitcoin, gold, and silver. He started by forecasting a bullish future for gold, stating, "Gold will soon break through $2,100 and then take off."
Kiyosaki's optimism about gold stems from the precious metal's historical role as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. His forecast suggests a significant increase in the value of gold, which has been catching the attention of investors as a traditional store of value.
However, what grabbed the attention of the Bitcoin community and investors was Kiyosaki's next prediction. He asserted, "Bitcoin testing $30,000. Next stop Bitcoin $135,000." This statement underscores Kiyosaki's belief in the potential of Bitcoin to not only recover from recent price fluctuations but to surge to new all-time highs.
Despite periodic market volatility, Bitcoin has maintained its status as the leading digital asset and is seen by many as a store of value and a hedge against global economic instability.
As investors and financial experts continue to navigate the complex financial landscape, Kiyosaki's forecasts serve as a reminder of the growing interest in alternative assets like Bitcoin and precious metals.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-23T18:33:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a surprising twist in Argentina's presidential election, pro-Bitcoin candidate Javier Gerardo Milei has emerged as a formidable contender, forcing a run-off election against current Economy Minister Sergio Massa after the first round of voting.
Javier Milei, a libertarian economist who has vowed to shut down the nation's central bank and expressed support for Bitcoin, managed to secure 31.2% of the vote, a remarkable achievement for a candidate with limited prior political exposure.Â 
Milei's passionate advocacy for economic reform have resonated with a significant portion of the electorate. In August, Milei wonÂ the most votes in the country's primary election, a fact owed to the nation's ongoing economic crisis.
In past remarks, Milei has said he will address Argentina's chronic economic woes, a message struck a chord with disillusioned voters.Â Argentina's annual inflation rate wasÂ 124.4% in August, its highest level since 1991.
The upcoming run-off election, slated for November 19th, will see Milei face off against Sergio Massa, who secured 46.7% of the vote in the first round, but missed the majority threshold needed to claim victory outright. In order to win outright, either candidate would have needed to claim 40% of the vote, and to lead his political opponent by 10% of the vote, owing to election rules.
The outcome of the run-off could have a profound impact on Argentina's economic policies and its role in the global cryptocurrency landscape.
Investors and crypto enthusiasts worldwide are closely watching this electoral showdown, anticipating its potential implications on the adoption of Bitcoin, and whether the nation could follow El Salvador's landmark legal tender law, which in 2021 made the cryptocurrency a payment method across the country.]]></summary>

In a move to intensify oversight of digital currency transactions, the agency unveiled a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) over the weekend, singling out crypto transaction mixing as a prime concern in the realm of money laundering.
 
Cryptocurrency mixers, also known as tumblers, are services that shuffle digital assets to obscure their origin, making them challenging to trace. This blending process often involves pooling funds from various sources and then redistributing them to different addresses, effectively severing the transaction trail.Â

        <updated>2023-10-23T15:26:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin rose by over 10% to start the week, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remained mostly bullish. The global market cap for crypto is up by 2.34% at the time of writing, which comes as a red wave swept through global stock indices. Polygon was another notable gainer on Monday.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin was a notable gainer on Monday, as the meme coin rallied past a key resistance level during the session.
 
Following a low of $0.06068 on Sunday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak at the $0.06525 mark.
 
This surge saw dogecoin break out of a ceiling at $0.0640, hitting its highest point since August 31 in the process.
 
 
One catalyst for the move was a breakout that occurred at the 65.00 level on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 65.94, with remaining bulls more than likely targeting the 70.00 level.
 
Earlier gains have somewhat slipped, with DOGE now trading at $0.06407.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
In addition to dogecoin, polygon (MATIC) also surged strongly on Monday, as the cryptocurrency reached a multi-month high
 
MATIC/USD jumped to a peak at $0.6315 to start the week, which comes a day after trading at a low of $0.56.
 
Mondayâ€™s high pushed polygon to its strongest point since August 16, when price reached a top at $0.638.
 
 
As a result of the rally, MATICâ€™s RSI rose to a three-month high at 68.79, but failed to break out of a ceiling at 69.00.
 
The index is now tracking at 66.60, despite the 10-day (red) moving average being on the cusp of crossing its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
