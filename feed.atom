Bitcoin Miners Haven’t Been Under This Much Stress In 3 Years
 
As pointed out by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a post on X, Bitcoin miners are being significantly underpaid right now. The indicator of relevance here is the “miner profit/loss sustainability,” which basically tells us whether the miner revenues are fair or not currently.

Alexey Pertsev, a 31-year old Russian national living in the Netherlands and one of the developers of the Ethereum-based privacy tool Tornado Cash, was today found guilty of money laundering by the Dutch court: he’s been sentenced to 64 months in prison. The fact that Pertsev never held custody of any cryptocurrency flowing through Tornado Cash — or could even control how the smart contract operated — was deemed irrelevant by the panel of judges, as he did contribute to the development of the software.
In line with Dutch public prosecutor Martine Boerlage, the court ruled that Tornado Cash was essentially ran like a business, operated by PepperSec, the company founded and operated by Pertsev and his t…]]></summary>

He added that Bitcoin is “celebrating with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support.” The crypto analyst had previously explained that the danger zone was the downside wick that Bitcoin experienced 21 days after the halving in 2016.
