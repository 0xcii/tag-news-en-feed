        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu is exhibiting interesting price action as it looks to break above a downward-sloping upper trendline under which it has been trading since the first week of March. Currently, SHIB is up by 10% in the past seven days and is at a decisive junction of a breakout that could lead to a strong bullish action. Failure to exhibit a strong breakout could lead to a reversal into bearish action. 
 
However, although SHIB is looking prime for a breakout, data shows there are still multiple resistance levels to overcome. Particularly, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock (ITB) reveals multiple walls of addresses between the current price and $0.000139.

The defeated rule would have forced banks holding digital assets for clients to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheets. This, according to the Digital Chamber of Commerce, the leading blockchain trade association, would have effectively shut the door on banks offering Bitcoin custody services.

However, Bitcoin enjoyed a stroke of fortune in the past week, with its price climbing above $67,000 for the first time in nearly a month. Although the sentiment around the crypto market and its leader has not been particularly encouraging in the last few weeks, the recent bullish rally seems to be driving a shift in that regard.
