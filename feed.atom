        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance.US has halted direct US dollar withdrawals  
from the platform. This change follows a series of regulatory actions by the US  
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As a result, Binance.US' users are  
now required to convert their US dollar holdings into stablecoins or other  
digital assets for withdrawal.
This decision was disclosed in the exchange's  
updated terms of use, which came into effect yesterday (Monday). However, this  
is no longer the case under the new terms. Previously, US dollar deposits in  
Binance.US' user wallets were covered by FDIC insurance protection, a safeguard  
that has now been eliminated.
"Your accounts and digital assets are not  
eligible for FDIC insurance protections," the crypto exchange indicated.

On Monday, October 16, FTX debtors agreed to settle its pending Chapter 11 court case, “Customer Shortfall Case.” The bankrupt crypto exchange proposed a resolution, offering FTX customers more than 90% of their missing assets toward the end of Q2 2024. FTX debtors have also put forward a $9 billion reimbursement for FTX.com and another $166 million for FTX.US.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ton-hovers-above-2-ada-bears-end-4-day-winning-run/"/>
        <updated>2023-10-17T15:51:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin rose for a third straight day on Tuesday, despite crypto markets mostly stalling in today’s session. At the time of writing, the global market cap is up 0.02%, as traders move to secure Monday’s gains. Cardano was in the red, following a four-day bull run.
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin was a big mover in today’s session, as the token continued to trade above its $2.00 threshold.
 
After falling to a low of $1.94 on Monday, TON/USD rallied to an intraday peak at $2.02 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the highest point toncoin has hit since last Thursday, when the price reached the same point.
 
 
Current bullish momentum has so far not been strong enough to force a breakout of this level, and this appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 49.24, which is marginally below a resistance level of 50.00.
 
In order for TON to move beyond today’s high, this ceiling on the RSI indicator will first need to be broken.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
On the other hand, cardano (ADA) fell for the first time in four days, as traders moved to secure recent gains.
 
ADA/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.2472 in today’s session, following a high of $0.253 the day before.
 
The move comes after bulls were unable to break out of a ceiling at $0.255 to start the week, with sellers entering the market in response.
 
 
Price now appears to be heading for a support point at $0.240, which has mostly been in place for the past four months.
 
A downward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages has also contributed to the decline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest inherent limitations to the Lightning Network is the limited number of channels that can be opened or closed per block given the blocksize limit. Regardless of how many transactions can occur off-chain how cheaply, this is a fundamental bottleneck restricting how many people could actually realistically use the Lightning Network. Even the Lightning Network whitepaper went through in the conclusion that in a scenario where the entire world's population of 7 billion was using Lightning, with only two on-chain transactions a year per person, Bitcoin would require 133 MB blocks for Lightning to work. This isn't some out of left field problem, or unpredictable issue, it was a limitation of the protocol design fully understood from day one.

This pivot, as reported by the Irish Independent, comes in the wake of a substantial dip in the frequency of cryptocurrency scams. While the crypto market has endured a prolonged bear run, the traditional banking sector has become the prime hunting ground for these illicit actors, resulting in a staggering loss of nearly 20 million euros ($21.8 million) to banking-related scams in 2023 alone.

significant step towards increasing transparency in the financial sector. The

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On October 16, 2023, Bitcoin’s difficulty impressively crossed the 61 trillion mark at block height 812,448, setting a fresh benchmark for the network. This ascent marked the fourth-largest rise in difficulty for the year. Yet, in the face of this increase, the hashrate has steadily and unflinchingly risen.
 
Bitcoin’s Difficulty Explodes to 61 Trillion, Hashrate Unyieldingly Marches Onward
 
On the heels of a 6.47% leap on Monday, Bitcoin’s difficulty peaked at an unprecedented 61.03 trillion, signifying the year’s fourth most significant spike. Miners previously navigated two back-to-back hikes: a 5.48% rise on September 19, followed by a slight 0.35% nudge upward on October 3.
 
Yet, despite these challenges, the hashrate is approaching its zenith, closely mirroring the high seen on October 12, 2023. By Tuesday, October 17, post the 6.47% surge in difficulty, the hashrate gracefully sails at 444 exahash per second (EH/s).
 

 
About 42 mining coalitions are pouring their hashrate into the Bitcoin chain, with the top five being Foundry USA, Antpool, Viabtc, F2pool, and Binance Pool. Over the last three days, Foundry has taken the lead, contributing 133.25 EH/s or 30.15% of the overall network’s hashrate, while Antpool churned out 116.95 EH/s, constituting 26.46% of the collective hashrate.
 
 
Come October 29, 2023, the next anticipated shift in difficulty is set to roll out after over 1,800 blocks are discovered. Notably, block intervals have consistently fallen short of the typical ten-minute mark, ranging between 9 minutes and 13 seconds and 9 minutes and 37 seconds.
 
The current block times suggest (unless things change) that if the hashrate persists in its vigor and block durations linger below the ten-minute threshold, we might see another hike. Projections currently hint at a potential increase anywhere between 0.18% to 4.2%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin remained near a two-month high on Tuesday, as markets digested the latest retail sales figures from the United States. Sales, which account for two thirds of the U.S. economy, rose by 0.7% in September, 0.4% higher than expected. Ethereum briefly rose above $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin continued to trade above $28,000 on Tuesday, following a better than expected increase in U.S. retail sales.
 
Despite slipping from a peak of $30,000 on Monday, BTC/USD traded above $28,600 in today’s session.
 
Although gains have eased, this was still considerably higher than yesterday’s low at the $27,855.21 level.
 
 
Overall, the recent upward trend means bitcoin is trading at its highest rate since August 18, which comes after the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a key resistance level.
 
The index surged beyond a ceiling at 63.00 in yesterday’s session, peaking above the 65.00 mark.
 
Price strength has since retreated, however is still marginally above the aforementioned point of resistance.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH), was lower in today’s session, after a brief stint trading above the $1,600 mark for the first time in almost ten days.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,628.16 to start the week, on the back of a tweet from Cointelegraph that suggested Blackrock’s spot bitcoin ETF was approved.
 
After these claims were proven to be incorrect, the cryptocurrency has since slipped, falling to a low at $1,570.89 earlier today.
 
 
As a result of Tuesday’s decline, bears have snapped a four-day win streak, and could now be targeting a floor at $1,540.
 
From the chart, it appears that a failure to move beyond a ceiling at 49.00 on the RSI indicator also contributed to today’s decline.
