Lyn Alden, a prominent figure in the macro world, commented, “I think this is the most politely brutal post I have ever read on this app. Like, every time I thought it might start to wrap up, the constructive savagery only grew.” Echoing Alden’s sentiments, Jamie Coutts of Bloomberg Intelligence labeled Cross’s post as a “supremely articulate take down.”
