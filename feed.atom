The case, which has become a lightning rod for the crypto industry, exposes the SEC’s aggressive enforcement tactics and raises questions about the agency’s use of legal tools.
 
 
The saga began in July 2023 when the SEC accused DEBT Box of defrauding investors out of nearly $50 million by selling unregistered securities in the form of “node licenses” for crypto mining.
 
In a dramatic move, the agency secured a temporary restraining order (TRO) freezing Debt Box’s assets. This extraordinary measure, typically used when a defendant poses a flight risk or could destroy evidence, was granted without notifying the company.
