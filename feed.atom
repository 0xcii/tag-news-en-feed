DOGE Day, celebrated on April 20, is earmarked to promote and reaffirm the values of the foremost meme coin launched in 2013. The meme coin, which was created as a “joke,” has continued to make a statement in the crypto market, and this journey is usually celebrated during DOGE Day.
 
 
Meanwhile, despite DOGE attaining this level of prominence, its community has always ensured the preservation of the crypto token’s goofy nature. As such, it is no surprise that DOGE Day is also on the same day as the one meant t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), launched in January 2024, have become a game-changer for cryptocurrency investing.
 
These new financial instruments attracted a massive inflow of over $12 billion in just three months, currently holding a significant 4.20% share of all bitcoins.
 
Recent trends raise questions about their short-term impact and highlight the complex dynamics at play in the crypto market.
 
 
The initial surge in ETF investment was attributed to their ease of access for mainstream investors. Unlike traditional methods like crypto exchanges, ETFs offer a familiar trading platform and potentially lower fees.
 
This accessibility fueled optimism, with some analysts predicting a repeat of the parabolic price growth witnessed after the 2020 halving, where bitcoin’s valu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Polygon Labs Marc Boiron, has expressed a negative sentiment towards layer 3 (L3) networks, arguing the necessity and implications of the solutions for scaling Ethereum – the second largest cryptocurrency asset.
 
Polygon CEO Claims Layer 3 Devalues Ethereum
 
In a heated conversation on the X platform, Marc Boiron claimed that these layer 3 networks pose a potential risk to the value of Ethereum. The Polygon CEO asserted that the major purpose of  L3s is to devalue ETH and the layer 2s that serve as the foundation for layer 3s.
 
As a result, Boiron believes that layer 3 is not required to scale Ethereum. Since L3 networks are not required to scale current networks, Boiton has declared that Polygon Labs will not operate on the networks.

        <updated>2024-04-01T10:53:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stablecoin issuer Tether has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 8,888 BTC worth around $600 million. This latest purchase was revealed through on-chain data rather than an official announcement.
Tether has not publicly disclosed its Bitcoin addresses. However, transactions tracked on the blockchain show 8,888 BTC were recently sent from the crypto exchange Bitfinex to an undisclosed Tether wallet.
The recipient address now holds over 75,000 BTC worth $5.3 billion. In May 2023, Tether first revealed it was allocating a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin, with plans to invest up to 15% of quarterly profits.
"The decision to invest in bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset," Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, said in the statement when they announced their Bitcoin strategy.
While unconfirmed, analysts believe the identified wallet likely belongs to Tether. The amount perfectly matches its pledged buying strategy and claimed holdings in its latest financial reports.
Tether has emerged as a major player in Bitcoin markets and its accumulation race. The company is now estimated to be the seventh largest holder of BTC. Its steady purchases, combined with those of institutional investors like MicroStrategy, tighten supply.
Critics have raised concerns about Tether's lack of transparency and the potential market risks of its growing bitcoin stash. However, its embrace of Bitcoin also shows the asset's broadening mainstream acceptance.
Tether aims to capitalize on Bitcoin's growth while diversifying its reserves away from traditional assets like government debt. Tether is one of the world's largest holders of U.S. Treasuries. 
This latest $600 million acquisition is unlikely to be Tether's last. As the stablecoin leader continues executing its Bitcoin investment strategy, its influence over Bitcoin markets is only set to increase.]]></summary>
