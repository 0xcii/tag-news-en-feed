This decision, while seen as a risky maneuver, will subject Bankman-Fried to cross-examination by federal prosecutors.
 
FTX Founder Set To Face Prosecution
 
Bankman-Fried’s defense team had previously argued that resolving his access to medication for Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was necessary for his full participation in the defense. 
 
With the medication issue now resolved, the FTX founder will testify in his defense, allowing federal prosecutors to question him regarding the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX.

Available ETH On Exchanges Fall To Genesis Levels
 
When the Ethereum network was first launched back in 2015, the available ETH on exchanges was very low due to it being a new player. The exchange balances would steadily rise over the next few years as the digital asset gained widespread acceptance and began trading on countless exchanges.

        <updated>2023-10-25T21:51:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, the bitcoin mining rig manufacturer Bitmain announced the introduction of a new air-cooled BTC miner, the T21 Antminer. The new device boasts a production capacity of up to 190 terahash per second (TH/s) and maintains an efficiency ratio of approximately 19 joules per terahash (J/T).
 
Bitmain Debuts T21 Antminer
 
After the recent unveiling of Microbt’s latest mining equipment, Bitmain, a competitor, has added the T21 Antminer to its extensive range of hashing devices. On October 25, Bitmain showcased the T21, capable of delivering 190 TH/s with an efficiency rating of 19 J/T.
 
Additionally, the company introduced an optional bitcoin price fluctuation plan, ensuring customers receive compensation if BTC’s prices fall below the strike on a reference day within a protected period.
 

 
The bitcoin fluctuation protection plan offers various tiers, depending on the duration of the protected period, with Bitmain asserting that “compensation shall be paid immediately upon the triggering event.”
 
The T21 Antminer is the latest in a series of launches by Bitmain, following two new devices from the S21 series introduced last month. The S21 Hyd achieves up to 335 TH/s with an efficiency rating of 16 J/T, while the air-cooled S21 miner provides up to 200 TH/s with an efficiency rating of about 17.5 J/T.
 
 
While the S21 air-cooled machine offers slightly superior ratings compared to the T21, the latter, however, surpasses the S19 Antminers in efficiency ratios. The specifications for the T21 detail a power consumption of 3,610 watts, with expected shipping in the first quarter of 2024.
 
The T21 is also comparable to the S21 air-cooled Antminer in terms of size and weight. This year has seen the release of several new devices by all three major bitcoin mining machine manufacturers: Bitmain with three, Canaan with two, and Microbt with three.
