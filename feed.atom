Emmer’s concerns stem from the approval of an emergency request by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for 82 Bitcoin mining firms to share proprietary information on their energy consumption. The Energy Department’s analytical agency, the Energy Information Administration (EIA), made the request.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Samson Mow, a developer and founder of a crypto project, has attributed the current Bitcoin price stability to the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. Taking to X on February 22, Mow argued that these spot ETFs have prevented a significant price drop.
 
Bitcoin Remains Higher Because Of Spot ETFs
 
The founder believes that without the influx of capital from spot Bitcoin ETFs, the cryptocurrency would have been “down between 10-20%,” potentially placing it below $40,000. So far, and when writing in mid-February, the various derivatives have injected billions of dollars into the Bitcoin market. Subsequently, the asset’s liquidity has increased.
