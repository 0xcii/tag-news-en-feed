His testimony provided a glimpse of what line of argument is to be expected from the defense as the case progresses. As Bankman-Fried’s lawyers questioned him, they emphasized on a particular document that could be the key to exonerating the defendant. 
 
Why This FTX Document Is So Important
 
According to a post by Inner City Press, which live posted happenings at the trial, Bankman-Fried’s primary counsel, Mark Cohen, had questioned the defendant about a ‘Document Retention Policy.’ In reply, SBF mentioned that the policy had been drawn up by the law firm Fenwick and West and, more specifically, Dan Friedman.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Proof-of-Stake (PoS) assets have recently faced a notable shift. According to a report, the market capitalization of PoS assets took some kind of beating, dropping by 7% in the third quarter of the year, with the total value shrinking to $254 billion. This decline has raised questions about the performance and future prospects of PoS assets.
 
PoS assets are a type of cryptocurrency that operates on a different principle than Proof-of-Work (PoW) assets like Bitcoin. In PoS, the validation of transactions and creation of new blocks are not dependent on energy-intensive mining processes. Instead, validators, or “stakers,” are chosen to create new blocks and verify transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to “stake” as collateral.

Addressing these concerns, Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, Lucie, broke down the mechanics of the process in a detailed statement on X (formerly Twitter) that shed light on the complexities involved.
 
SHIB Burns On Shibarium
 
Lucie began by delving deep into the intricacies of the bridging process between Ethereum (L1) and Shibarium (L2). She stated: “When you initially bridge your SHIB to Shibarium, the original SHIB tokens are locked in the bridge contract, while a version of the token is minted on Shibarium.”
