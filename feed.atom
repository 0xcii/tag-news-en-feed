        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, has experienced an extraordinary surge in bullish momentum, breaking previous cycle patterns and achieving an astonishing 60% price increase in the past month. Today, Bitcoin has breached its previous record, reaching a new all-time high (ATH) and currently trading at $69,200. 
 
 
Bitcoin’s Price Surge
 
The success of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have been trading for just over seven weeks, has opened doors for both institutional and retail investors. The SEC’s approval of these investment vehicles has provided a regulated and accessible entry point into the cryptocurrency market. This development has fueled heightened interest and confidence, leading to increased demand for BTC and propelling its price to new heights.

        <updated>2024-03-05T15:06:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nexo's entity based in Dubai has secured the initial  
approval from Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) to offer  
lending, borrowing, investment, and broker-dealer services for virtual assets.  
This marks the digital asset platform's entry into Dubai's digital asset space.
Kalin Metodiev, the Co-Founder and Managing Partner  
at Nexo, mentioned: "Nexo is enthusiastic about the pursuit of new market  
strategies aligned with the transformative guidance of Dubai's Virtual Asset  
Regulatory Authority."
Nexo's Global Expansion
Dubai established the VARA in 2022, highlighting the  
region's commitment to becoming a global hub for digital asset innovation. For  
Nexo, with its user base of 7 million, Dubai represents a significant  
opportunity in its global expansion plans.
VARA regulates virtual assets across the Emirate of Dubai, including Special Development Zones and Free Zones, but excluding the Dubai International Financial Centre. This entity plays an important role in creating legal frameworks for protecting investors and establishing international standards for the virtual asset industry.
Recently, Nexo launched a legal offensive against the Republic of Bulgaria, filing a substantial arbitration claim exceeding $3  
billion. The claim stems from what Nexo termed as unjust and politically  
motivated interferences by Bulgarian authorities, disrupting crucial deals and  
causing significant financial harm.
Defying Regulatory Hurdles
Nexo's pursuit of justice follows the dismissal of  
baseless criminal charges against its leadership, including Kosta Kantchev,  
Antoni Trenchev, Kalin Metodiev, and Trayan Nikolov. The company's collaborations with investment banks  
for a funding round and an IPO valued at $8-$12 billion were disrupted. Moreover,  
a strategic partnership with a major European football club was abruptly  
halted.

As pointed out by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the BTC network has just witnessed the movement of coins dormant since 10+ years ago.
 
The indicator of interest here is the “Spent Output Age Bands” (SOAB), which measures the total amount of coins that the various Bitcoin age bands are moving across the chain right now.
 
 
The age bands here refer to groups of tokens divided based on the amount of time they have remained dormant on the network for (that is, the time that they have spent sitting still inside the same address, without being involved in transac…]]></summary>
