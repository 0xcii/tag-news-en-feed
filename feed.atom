        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-moves-back-below-29000-as-bullish-sentiment-weakens/"/>
        <updated>2023-08-03T12:16:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was once again trading below the $29,000 level on Thursday, as bulls retreated following yesterday’s gains. The drop appeared to come as traders secured profits, following a failed breakout of a key price point. Ethereum also edged lower today. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $29,000 zone in today’s session, as bulls appeared to have abandoned their positions following Wednesday’s gains.
 
After peaking at $29,988.00 yesterday, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $28,946.51 earlier in the day.
 
This comes as the bullish sentiment surrounding Microstrategy’s latest BTC investment seems to have already faded.
 
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) failed to move past a key ceiling at 50.00, and has bounded off a floor at 42.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 42.79, with BTC climbing back above the $29,000 mark as a result.
 
Price may now consolidate, as traders’ attention turns to Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) also moved lower earlier in the day, dropping below a support point of $1,850 in the process.
 
ETH/USD bottomed out at $1,822.35 during today’s session, following Wednesday’s high at $1,860.19.
 
As a result of today’s decline, ethereum moved back towards a four-week low at $1,812.
 
 
The slippage took place after the RSI fell below a floor at the 45.00 level, and it is now at a reading of 41.93.
 
Should momentum continue to drop, the next price target will likely be the $1,795 level.

I’ve recently returned from spending a long weekend with around 200,000 others at one of the loves of my life, Glastonbury Festival. The 2023 version of this annual music festival was peppered with sets from big name acts — Elton John, Guns N’ Roses and Foo Fighters, to name a few — but the inevitable media focus on these tends to mislead those viewing it from the outside. Glastonbury is a phenomenon of vast scale; it could be described as 10 festivals wrapped into one. Nearly everyone who goes will tell you they’ve had a great time, but probably all for different reasons.
