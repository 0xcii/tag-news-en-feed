        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday’s ruling by a U.S. District Judge on Dapper Labs’ motion to dismiss a lawsuit alleging that NBA Top Shot NFTs are an unregistered security may have a “net positive” impact on Ripple’s case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. At least that’s what James “MetaLawMan” Murphy, an attorney and strategic advisor, claims.
 
District Judge Victor Marrero stated in his decision that Dapper Labs’ NFT collection appears to meet the requirements of a security under the Howey test. Based on this, he denied Dapper Labs’ motion to dismiss.
 
NBA Top Shots was launched by Dapper Labs in 2021 and is one of the most successful NFT collections of all time. NFT buyers can collect video highlights from the National Basketball Association (NBA) released by the company.

In the interim, an early denial to Dapper Labs’ motion to dismiss the case suggests that there very well could be legs to the discussion.
 
Top Shot’s Case Considerations 
Filings from the district court Southern District of New York circulating on the internet Wednesday revealed the denial of the motion to dismiss, with a number of considerations. Most importantly, this is far from a definitive ruling on any matter, but it does essentially verify that the court sees the claim as having legitimacy.

According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Immutable made the announcement to employees on Wednesday morning. The company had previously raised $280 million from investors in a funding round that valued the crypto gaming company at $3.5 billion in March of last year.
 
It appears that the company’s June layoff of 20 employees, or around 6% of its personnel, was insufficient to prevent financial difficulties and the necessity to preserve cash flow following the fall of the cryptocurrency market.

Sir Tim Berners-Lee on Crypto
 
Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the British computer scientist who is widely credited with the invention of the World Wide Web, shared his thoughts about cryptocurrency on CNBC’s “Beyond the Valley” podcast, published last week.
 
Berners-Lee called cryptocurrency “dangerous” and likened it to gambling. Claiming that “cryptocurrency can be 100% speculative” and “not linked to anything at all,” he opined:
 

It’s only speculative. Obviously, that’s really dangerous.
 
He asserted that crypto is for “if you want to have a kick out of gambling, basically.” He also compared cryptocurrency to the dot-com bubble, noting that people were valuing various internet stocks “because of what they imagined other people will value them in the future, so in other words it wasn’t based on revenue or anything real so the bubble came.” He further stressed: “Investing in certain things, which is purely speculative, isn’t what, where I want to spend my time.”
 
 
However, Berners-Lee said cryptocurrencies could be useful for remittances. He shared:
 

Having been using it for remittances, that seems to be the most useful thing, if you transfer stuff into blockchain because you can get that immediately to your family.
 
The British computer scientist emphasized: “Just don’t keep the currency … get rid of it, put it back into USD.”
