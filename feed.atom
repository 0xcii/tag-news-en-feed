At the center of the turbulence lies a colossal 80 million XRP transfer by Ripple itself, sending shockwaves through the community and raising legal eyebrows.

The crypto founder’s parents were entangled in the legal fallout due to their alleged participation and involvement with the failed company.
 
 
 
 
 
FTX Legal Fallout: SBF’s Parents React To Lawsuit
 
Last year, the FTX’s debtor launched a lawsuit against SBF’s family. Now, Barbara Fried and Alan Joseph Bankman, through their legal representation, have filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint against them.
