        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest meme-based cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently formed a second low, suggesting that the meme coin could be gearing up for a potential 4,000% rally to new all-time highs above $4. 
 
Dogecoin Second Low Could Signal Big Gains Ahead
 
Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst, told his 55,100 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that Dogecoin has officially formed a second low after touching a crucial support level. He shared a price chart illustrating Dogecoin’s price movements since 2014, highlighting periods where the meme coin had formed a first and second low after hitting a key support level, which then led to a massive price surge. 
 
 
 
From 2014 and 2017, Dogecoin found support in 2015, followed by a second low in 2017, which triggered a substa…]]></summary>

Recent data from Santiment highlights a notable shift: Bitcoin is becoming progressively less sensitive to fluctuations in equities. This suggests that while both markets grapple with volatility, their interactions may not be as intertwined. 
 
As we move forward, price action might be influenced more by its market dynamics rather than broader stock market trends. This shift could mean that, despite ongoing volatility, the fundamental correlation between US stocks and BTC might diminish, leading to a period where BTC’s movements are increasingly drive…]]></summary>

After closing August on a bearish note, the leading cryptocurrency has continued to exhibit signs of weakness after September began. The early days of the month have already seen Bitcoin edging further into bearish territory, a development that could potentially signal a prolonged period of capitulation throughout the rest of the month. However, keeping in mind this is BTC we’re talking about, and we’re only three days into September, we could see the crypto bounce back up sometime in the middle of the month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Fortune, Coinbase’s Chief Financial Officer, Alesia Haas, said that U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is using the company’s Commerce platform to accept cryptocurrency donations for her campaign. 
The statement was made during a conversation with Citigroup’s Director of Payments, Peter Christiansen, at the Citi 2024 Global TMT Conference in New York, in which Fortune reviewed a recording of the conversation.
 
                    
 
                         
                    
 
                     
                
“She is accepting crypto donations,” reportedly said Haas. “She’s using Coinbase Commerce now to accept crypto for her own campaign.”
However, pro-Harris advocacy group Crypto4Harris said that they were unaware of this move. Additionally, Harris's official fundraising site does not yet display crypto donation options. So far, Harris’s campaign and Coinbase were reached out to for comment, but Fortune has not heard back yet at the time of writing.
The "Crypto for Harris" initiative, launched last month, aims to garner support from crypto enthusiasts as Harris seeks to strengthen her presidential bid. 
“She has a huge opportunity, we’re cautiously optimistic,” Haas reportedly continued. “She has not rolled out the details yet, but she has made overtures that she would like to drive crypto legislation.”
Harris’ decision to accept cryptocurrency donations marks a strategic move to rival her opponent Donald Trump, who earlier this year embraced Bitcoin Lightning Network donations for his campaign. Trump's alignment with the Bitcoin community was further solidified when he spoke at The Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville—an event Harris notably declined to attend.]]></summary>

Privacy is a fundamental issue in using a public blockchain system like Bitcoin. Numerous projects and proposals have been made over the years to either build privacy preserving tools on top of Bitcoin, or fundamentally add privacy at the protocol layer itself. Satoshi himself discussed briefly the idea of zero knowledge proofs being a mechanism to enable greater privacy before he left. 
This is all the original whitepaper had to say on the topic of privacy:

Grewal said the bipartisan bill FIT 21 is a founding block for clear regulations and investor protection, and this should ultimately mean the crypto landscape focuses more on legislation rather than litigation. He also named European regulations as perhaps setting a model for the US approach toward crypto regulation.
