Auction Off The FTX Domain And Trademark, Jesse Powell Says
 
On Wednesday, August 2, Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell tweeted his concerns about the plans to relaunch the FTX exchange. This was in response to another tweet by a former FTX user, agreeing that the exchange relaunch is “unnecessary.”
 
Powell believes that going ahead with the FTX 2.0 plans will be “worse than starting from scratch,” as there is no adequate framework to initiate such a process. He said the exchange has “no team, no tech, no licenses, no banking, and a tarnished brand.”

Specifically, approximately 29% of Bitcoin Lightning Network nodes are deployed on AWS, while 19% are hosted on Google Cloud. 
 
 
This trend points to the high reliance of Bitcoin Lightning Network node operators on centralized cloud services. Unlike operating a local node, reliant on centralized solutions can offer a high degree of uptime and reliability, reaching nearly 100%.

In a new development on Aug. 2, Reuters reports that Worldcoin wants certain third parties to utilize its digital ID system to expand its operations and onboard more users.  
 
The World digital ID system has drawn much criticism on user privacy since its launch due to its use of iris-scanning “Orbs” for identity verification. However, Worldcoin appears to be dousing these concerns as it shares more potential benefits of this system.

A recently published report by Grayscale, the world-renowned digital asset manager, places the recovery of the crypto market squarely on the shoulders of the U.S. economy.
 
According to the report, the continuation of this rebound is intrinsically tied to the U.S.’s ability to achieve what economists call a “soft landing.”
 
 
The Role Of The Fed And The Crypto Recovery
 
Macroeconomic factors have emerged as significant risk contributors to the volatile world of cryptocurrency valuations. In this context, the premise of a ‘soft landing’ is linked to the Federal Reserve’s ability to reach its 2% inflation goal without a stark rise in unemployment.

Is The Bitcoin Halving Bullish Or Bullshit?
 
Bitcoin price continues to meander mostly sideways for going on its sixth month. Few expect any type of movement to the upside until after the next block reward halving. The recurring event happening every four years, is scheduled for approximately April 2024.
 

 
 
Looking at the 1M BTCUSD price chart, it is very easy to see why, upon visual inspection, one might assume that Bitcoin rises after the halving and that it is pretty much a sure thing at this point.
