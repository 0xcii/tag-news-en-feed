        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Charles Gasparino of Fox Business, financial firms feel confident that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is going to rule in favor of approving spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) after January 8, 2024.



Gasparino's post also stated that shares the of Bitcoin ETFs will only be available to purchase with cash, rather than also with bitcoin. As the regulator is "worried about ETF's being used as a vehicle for money laundering." Over the course of the past few weeks, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers like BlackRock have been meeting with the SEC to discuss the final details of their ETFs. There was one topic in particular that the regulator was meeting with issuers about, and that was in-kind vs in-cash creations for shares of the ETFs.
