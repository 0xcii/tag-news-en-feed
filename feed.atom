Jim Cramer’s Latest Crypto Advice
 
The host of CNBC’s Mad Money show, Jim Cramer, has advised investors to sell their cryptocurrencies following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Cramer is a former hedge fund manager who co-founded Thestreet.com, a financial news and literacy website. He said Monday:
 

You can’t just beat yourself up and say, ‘hey, it’s too late to sell.’ The truth is, it’s never too late to sell an awful position, and that’s what you have if you own these so-called digital assets.

Crypto Market Correlation: Altcoin Indexes And Bitcoin Register Similar Returns
 
As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the crypto market has mostly been trading in tandem recently.
 
To easily assess how the different segments of the crypto sector are performing against each other, the market is divided into “altcoin indexes”
 
These indexes are market cap weighted, meaning coins are put into them based on the worth of their total circulating supplies.
 
There are three major altcoin indexes: the “large caps,” the “mid caps,” and the “small caps.” As their names imply, each of these cover a different sized segment of the crypto market.

        <updated>2022-12-07T19:56:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bill that would create new licensing and electricity purchase requirements has been sent on to a third vote.
Kazakhstan is moving forward with regulation that will further stifle its bitcoin mining industry.
The country’s federal parliamentary body has completed secondary approval of a bill "On Digital Assets in the Republic of Kazakhstan." With a third approval, the legislation will introduce new licensing requirements for bitcoin miners based on their facility ownership and operational structure. It would also require that miners purchase their electricity from the energy provider Korem at market rates. 
Previously, specific reporting and tax requirements were implemented, including registration of names, locations and quarterly reports to the government. These occurred as a result of the major influx of mining amidst energy shortages and protests, all while bitcoin miners fled China as a response to the government’s banning of bitcoin.
Kazakhstan’s close proximity to China and previously highly favorable energy access led to the large amounts of hash rate migrating to the country. Afterwards, Kazakhstan went as far as seizing up to $200 million in mining equipment who did not comply with regulation, and the country continues to try and absorb the benefits of the influx in bitcoin mining using legislation like this most recently approved bill. 
Bitcoin Magazine previously reported on regulation in Kazakhstan, citing a report from the Russian media outlet Tass. In the report, Ekaterina Smyshlyaeva, a member of the Committee on Economic Reform and Regional Development of the Majilis (Kazakhstan’s federal parliamentary body) detailed the government’s intentions, describing how, "Kazakhstan was used as a raw material appendage of the blockchain industry. [Through] bills, we oblige miners to license in Kazakhstan, that is, to create legal entities and become full-fledged subjects of taxation.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler spoke about the FTX collapse, the state of crypto regulation, and its cooperation with international regulators. The SEC Chair has come under fire due to recent events and his connection to the exchange’s former CEO, Sam Bankman Fried (SBF). 
 
 
Gensler talked with Yahoo Finance following the FTX debacle and accusations about his involvement in supporting SBF to “obtain a regulatory monopoly,” according to U.S. Representative Tom Emmer. The Gensler administration has seen some of the worst blow-ups in the nascent industry.

Bitcoin mining companies continue struggling to survive the ongoing bear market. Dreams of outperforming bitcoin as a public mining company are long gone. Bankruptcies and lawsuits make routine headlines. And even Wall Street analysts that were once bullish on bitcoin mining investment opportunities now say they’re “pulling the plug” until the market improves. But exactly how bad is the current bear market?
It’s always darkest before dawn, as the adage says. And compared to previous bear markets, the mining industry looks much closer to the end of a turbulent market phase than the beginning of it. This article explores a bunch of data sets from the current and…]]></summary>

Award-Winning Singer Taylor Swift Was Allegedly Courted by FTX Executives
 
A report published by the Financial Times (FT) claims that FTX “held talks with Taylor Swift over $100mn sponsorship deal.” Swift is a famous American singer with a number of platinum-certified albums under her wing. Reportedly, the alleged Swift and FTX sponsorship deal stagnated and never materialized into anything.
