        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain records have shed light on a development involving the trustees of the now-defunct exchange FTX, who are overseeing its bankruptcy proceedings. They have committed 5.5 million solana (SOL) for staking. Meanwhile, the current market value of FTX’s total solana assets is a hefty $1.16 billion. However, it’s worth highlighting that a significant portion of these assets will be held in a lock-up period, not to be fully released until 2028. 
 
Blockchain Unmasks Massive SOL Stake by FTX Trustees Amid Bankruptcy Proceedings
 
Whale Alert, on October 13, reported a transfer of 5.5 million SOL. Following this revelation, onchain researcher Ashpool identified that the sizable amount of SOL belonged to the FTX estate. Ashpool further mentioned that the funds were directed towards the validator Figment for the purpose of staking.
 

 
The outcome of SOL staking can vary. Some sources assert that SOL staking has traditionally offered around 5.5% APY. Yet, others suggest that SOL staking can yield as much as 14.47% APY, contingent on the staking platform chosen. Rewards for staking in Solana are distributed approximately every 2-3 days, albeit the precise frequency of rewards can fluctuate based on network conditions and other variables.
 
 
FTX’s estate holds roughly $1.16 billion in SOL, but not all of it is immediately accessible. 12 million of FTX’s SOL cache is scheduled to be released in increments every 30 days until 2027. An additional 34.52 million SOL is set to be gradually unlocked every month until 2028. Both of these caches are disbursing monthly SOL that FTX can either sell or stake. However, FTX has the option to sell the keys to the entire vested cache before its official release.

Self custody is an essential requirement when using Bitcoin to fully benefit from all the properties that make Bitcoin valuable in the first place. To be able to truly transact without permission, benefiting from the censorship resistance of the network, you have to control your own keys. You can’t outsource that to someone else, you can’t trust the neutrality or honesty of a custodian, you must solely have direct control of corresponding private keys to your UTXOs. If you fail to do this, you will always be a second class user. Bitcoin as a system gives you almost total control over your own funds; control of custody, when it is spe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saturday saw shiba inu climb to its highest point since Monday, as bulls made a slight return to the market. The meme coin rose by as much as 4% on Saturday, as the global crypto market cap made gradual gains to start the weekend. Solana was another notable mover, climbing above the $22.00 zone.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) rallied for a third straight session on Saturday, as the meme coin jumped nearly 4% higher in the day.
 
Following a low of $0.000006828 on Friday, SHIB/USD climbed to a peak of $0.000007099 to start the weekend.
 
This is the highest point that SHIB has hit since Monday, when price was trading at a high of $0.00000721.
 
 
The rally started after bulls rejected a breakout of a floor at $0.00000670 earlier this week, and they now look to be taking the coin to a resistance level of $0.00000760.
 
From the chart, it appears that the surge has resulted in the relative strength index (RSI) moving above its own ceiling at 45.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is at a reading of 46.39, with the next visible point of resistance at 51.00.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) extended its own gains to start the weekend, as the cryptocurrency finally rose above $22.00.
 
SOL/USD peaked at $22.20 earlier in today’s session, which comes following Friday’s low at the $21.39 level.
 
Earlier gains have since eased as the day matured, which came after bulls began to close previous positions.
 
 
One reason for this can be attributed to the RSI, which collided with a ceiling around the 53.00 region.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 53.02, with solana trading at $21.92, as momentum begins to shift.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin retreated from a brief spell above $27,000 on Saturday, as uncertainty in the market remained high to start the weekend. The global cryptocurrency market was marginally higher to start the weekend, trading 0.42% higher as of writing. Ethereum continued to consolidate above a recent floor of $1,535.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) retreated below the $27,000 level to start the weekend, after a late surge in price on Friday.
 
Following a low of $26,686.32 earlier in Friday’s session, BTC/USD peaked at a high of $27,092.70 as the day progressed.
 
Although BTC has since slipped, and is currently trading at $26,866.74, it is still higher than yesterday’s bottom.
 
 
The consolidation comes as the relative strength index (RSI) continues to hover above a floor at the 45.00 mark.
 
Whilst now tracking at 46.72, the next target is likely to be at a ceiling of 50.00, and if hit, bitcoin will be back above $27,000.
 
Overall, bitcoin is trading 4% lower than at the same point last week.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) is largely unchanged at the time of writing, as the cryptocurrency consolidated to start the weekend.
 
ETH/USD reached a high of $1,571.75 on Friday, however has since fallen to a current reading of $1,546.80.
 
This is slightly higher than yesterday’s low at $1,538.09, which was marginally above a support point at $1,535.
 
 
The drop in price coincides with the RSI failing to breach its own point of resistance at the 40.00 mark.
 
Currently, price strength is at the 37.46 level, with the 10-day moving average continuing to trend downwards.

In a high-profile ruling on August 29, the US District of Columbia Court of Appeals granted the prominent asset manager’s request to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) following an initial denial by the SEC.
