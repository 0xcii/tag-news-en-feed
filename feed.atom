        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has  
escalated its legal battle against Binance.US, urging a court in D.C. to allow  
inspection into the exchange's asset custody services. This move comes as the  
SEC doubles down on its allegations that Binance.US has been evasive with  
requested documents. 
The latest development involves a protective order, aimed to  
counter what the exchange terms as SEC's "fishing expedition," that  
Binance.US sought in June. This matter was referred to Magistrate Judge Zia  
Faruqui by Federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson.
The SEC's legal  
action against Binance.US dates back to June when the regulatory watchdog  
filed a lawsuit targeting Binance.US, its global parent company Binance  
Holdings, and its founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The blocksize war marked a pivotal chapter in Bitcoin's nascent history, illuminating the ability of node operators to withstand systemic changes that could undermine the network's foundational principles of decentralization and censorship resistance. At the crux of the controversy was the issue of scaling Bitcoin to accommodate growing transaction volumes. While one camp advocated sacrificing a degree of decentralization through a block size increase, their opponents maintained that the cost to Bitcoin's core ethos was untenable. The ensuing deadlock culminated in a contentious change, Segregated Witness (SegWit). By restructuring how transactions are stored, SegWit offered a moderate capacity increase while also fixing the transaction malleability issue that had hindered advanced functio…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Casey Rodarmor, the creator of the Ordinals protocol, made a surprising return to the public eye during the Ordinals Summit held in Singapore this week.   
The appearance marks Rodarmor's first public engagement in months, following a period of isolation after the protocol's launch in January of this year. He previously broke his silence most recently with a lengthy podcast in which he aired his concerns about Paul Storzc's drivechains upgrade proposal.
The Ordinals Summit, a gathering of NFT enthusiasts, was a notable celebration of the protocol at a time when its use has seemingly declined. The software, which allows digital artifacts to be traded like NFTs on the Bitcoin network, had previously garnered significant attention and praise from collectors and earned criticism for breaking crypto's rigid cultural lines.
The growing popularity of the Ordinals protocol among NFT collectors had taken Rodarmor by surprise. It gained traction rapidly, filling a niche in the market for Bitcoin enthusiasts who wished to participate in the NFT space. However, this success also drew the ire of some Bitcoin proponents who were staunchly against NFTs, though the reasons for the critiques varied from moral to technical objections.
In response to this polarized reaction, Rodarmor chose to step back from the limelight temporarily, focusing on refining the Ordinals protocol. Last week marked a notable change with Rodarmor merging an upgrade that helps more clearly establish provenance for the inscriptions that comprise a specific collection.
In his keynote address, he expressed gratitude for the support the community had shown and emphasized the need for innovation within the cryptocurrency space.
The Ordinals Summit was attended by a diverse range of developers and enthusiasts, all keen to explore the potential of the Ordinals protocol and its impact on the future of NFTs. Notable speakers included Udi Wertheimer, creator of the Taproot Wizards NFT project and, Domo, the pseudonymous creator of the BRC-20 protocol.]]></summary>

The 11-Year Slumber: $24.88M in Bitcoin Emerges From 2012 Wallets
 
Another set of vintage bitcoins from 2012 was transferred for the first time in more than 11 years. This means a total of nine 2012 so-called “sleeping bitcoin” transactions have now occurred in 2023. While we can’t officially determine if the owner was a single entity, clustering heuristics and the acquisition dates suggest it’s likely a single owner movement. The first transaction moved 199.99 BTC from the address “1NmFy,” confirmed at block height 808,207. T…]]></summary>

Ripple And SEC Guaranteed To Settle
 
In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Rector stated that both parties are “100%” likely to settle before the case goes to trial as the SEC won’t want Ripple to call witnesses like the “Ethereum ICO Insider” Steven Nerayoff. This is because Nerayoff recently came forward to detail how Ethereum got preferential treatment during its Initial Coin Offering (ICO).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana neared the $20.00 level on Monday, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets to start the week. The rise in momentum comes as focus shifts to the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Bitcoin cash was another notable gainer today.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana bulls pushed the token towards the $20.00 level on Monday, as markets geared up for a key week of U.S. economic data.
 
SOL/USD peaked at $19.95 to start the week, which comes following a low of $18.65 the day prior.
 
This surge in price pushed solana to its strongest level since September 8 when price was last above $20.00.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose above a key ceiling at the 49.00 mark.
 
The index is currently tracking at the 50.45 mark at the time of writing, with the next visible ceiling at 53.00
 
In the event price strength rallies beyond this point, SOL will likely be tracking around $20.50.
 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Another big mover on Monday was bitcoin cash (BCH), which surged by as much as 5% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $205.78 on Sunday, BCH/USD rallied to an intraday high of $221.88 to start the week.
 
As a result of the move, bitcoin cash briefly broke out of a ceiling at $222.00, hitting a three-week high in the process.
 
 
This surge has pushed price strength to a collision with a resistance level of its own, at the 60.00 mark.
 
The index is tracking marginally above this point at 61.44, which is the highest area it has hit since July.
 
Should it continue to move past the aforementioned ceiling, there is a chance that BCH will near $240.00 in the coming days.

As we approach

CBDCs have

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Casey Rodarmor, the creator of the Ordinals protocol, made a surprising return to the public eye during the Ordinals Summit held in Singapore this week.   
The appearance marks Rodarmor's first public engagement in months, following a period of isolation after the protocol's launch in January of this year. He previously broke his silence most recently with a lengthy podcast in which he aired his concerns about Paul Storzc's drivechains upgrade proposal.
The Ordinals Summit, a gathering of NFT enthusiasts, was a notable celebration of the protocol at a time when its use has seemingly declined. The software, which allows digital artifacts to be traded like NFTs on the Bitcoin network, had previously garnered significant attention and praise from collectors and earned criticism for breaking crypto's rigid cultural lines.
The growing popularity of the Ordinals protocol among NFT collectors had taken Rodarmor by surprise. It gained traction rapidly, filling a niche in the market for Bitcoin enthusiasts who wished to participate in the NFT space. However, this success also drew the ire of some Bitcoin proponents who were staunchly against NFTs, though the reasons for the critiques varied from moral to technical objections.
In response to this polarized reaction, Rodarmor chose to step back from the limelight temporarily, focusing on refining the Ordinals protocol. Last week marked a notable change with Rodarmor merging an upgrade that helps more clearly establish provenance for the inscriptions that comprise a specific collection.
In his keynote address, he expressed gratitude for the support the community had shown and emphasized the need for innovation within the cryptocurrency space.
The Ordinals Summit was attended by a diverse range of developers and enthusiasts, all keen to explore the potential of the Ordinals protocol and its impact on the future of NFTs. Notable speakers included Udi Wertheimer, creator of the Taproot Wizards NFT project and, Domo, the pseudonymous creator of the BRC-20 protocol.]]></summary>
