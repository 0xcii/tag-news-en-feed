        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Colorado Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has announced it accepts cryptocurrency for its online services via the payment processor Paypal. Besides paying local taxes with coins, residents of the crypto-friendly state will be able to use their digital cash to renew driver’s licenses and plates.
 
Colorado Introduces Online Payments With Crypto at the DMV
 
People in Colorado who use the online services of the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, like renewing a driver’s license or vehicle registration, can now pay with cryptocurrency through the popular payment platform Paypal, the Denver 7 TV channel reported.
 
Those who chose to pay with crypto will be directed to Paypal, where they can select the digital currency they want to use which will then be converted to U.S. dollars and eventually transferred to the department, DMV officials explained.
 
 
“At the DMV, we’re always looking for ways to better serve Coloradans and leverage technology to offer our services,” Senior Director Electra Bustle emphasized in a statement quoted on Thursday. The executive further elaborated:
 

This new online cryptocurrency payment option is yet another way the DMV is providing innovative and convenient service delivery to our customers.
 
A service fee of $1 plus 1.83% of the DMV total will be applicable to payments made with cryptocurrencies, the department noted. The DMV is currently accepting crypto transactions only through Paypal which can apply its own fees.
 
Colorado has been open towards cryptocurrency adoption. Under Governor Jared Polis, it started accepting crypto as payment of state taxes and fees in the summer of 2020. The Colorado Digital Token Act, which allows certain cryptocurrencies to have securities exemptions, was passed the previous year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to cybersecurity firm Certik, nearly $1 billion in cryptocurrency has been pilfered due to scams, rug pulls, and exploits throughout 2023. The company highlighted that the combined incidents in August alone led to a loss of $45.8 million.
 
Certik Analysis: Cryptocurrency Losses Near $1 Billion
 
The digital security and smart contract auditing firm Certik disclosed that $45.8 million was purloined last month from various exploits, hacks, and deceptions. The PEPE token exit scam took the lead in August with a staggering $13.2 million, followed closely by the Exactly Protocol incident at $7.3 million.
 

 
Certik pointed out that exit scams led to $26 million in losses, flash loans were responsible for $6.4 million, and general exploits amounted to $13.5 million in August. Additionally, Certik’s analysis states that almost $1 billion, or approximately $997,345,346 was misappropriated in 2023 via scams, exploits, rug pulls, and flash loans. July emerged as the year’s leader thus far in terms of the amount pilfered through exploits during 2023.
 
Exit scams’ peak month was May, but August came dangerously close with the recent PEPE incident. Regarding flash loan attacks, there’s been a modest number all year; however, a significant spike occurred in March when more than $200 million was snatched that month through flash loan attacks. In total, flash loan attacks accounted for $261 million this year.
 
Exploits reached a total of $596 million in 2023, with $137 million linked to exit scams as per Certik’s findings. Although PEPE was August’s most colossal exit scam, the Zunami Protocol attack emerged as the largest flash loan issue during that month. Meanwhile, the Exactly Protocol incident turned out to be August’s most significant exploit.
