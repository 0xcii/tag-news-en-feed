        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It might be imagined that the concept of a financial system that cannot be controlled by a central bank would be anathema to China’s ruling party, but decentralisation is not an uncommon feature of Chinese society.
A paper published in the China Economic Review in 2020 referred to that country’s unique blend of political centralisation and decentralisation of economic power and responsibility, noting that even after the centralising reforms in the last three decades, the fiscal system is largely decentralised.
For a certain subset of cryptocurrency users, decentralised finance is filling the gap for cryptocurrency services in China, although there is a major limitation in the shape of the efficiency and liquidity of centralised exchanges.  

So while volumes at decentralised exchanges cont…]]></summary>

 - Jerome Powell, June 21, 2023

On the longest day of the year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell took to the podium to testify before congress and the House Financial Services Committee. Last week, the Powell-led central bank had decided to temporarily pause rate hikes –the fastest and most aggressive interest rate increases in U.S. history–in their mission to battle the massive price inflation found downstream from the lockdown-induced monetary inflation via stimulus measures. Less than a month away from the announced July launch of FedNow, an interbanking communication platform, Powell finds himself at a crossroad of monetary policy, regulation, and capital requirements before the formal founding of the digital dollar sy…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amidst a surge of activity within the ETF space, Valkyrie Investments has made significant moves to establish its presence once again. A Delaware-based subsidiary of Valkyrie Investments Inc. has filed an updated spot ETF proposal, altering the intended exchange to Nasdaq and changing the ticker to $BRRR.
The company, which already has a bitcoin futures ETF product listed on the Nasdaq, is likely to have been closely observing the developments in the industry, with a particular focus on other firms entering the ETF market. Notably, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, filed a spot bitcoin ETF application, perhaps taking advantage of recent regulatory scrutiny to facilitate its entry into the market. This move by BlackRock, a prominent player in traditional finance, indicates the growing acceptance and interest in bitcoin among institutional investors.
Furthermore, WisdomTree, an asset management company, has also submitted an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. This application signals the increasing competition among firms aiming to launch bitcoin ETFs, as they recognize the demand for regulated investment products in the space, along with the first-movers advantage possible.
In addition, Bitwise filed a 19b-4 form to renew their spot bitcoin ETF filing, while Invesco renewed their filing for a spot bitcoin ETF.
As firms like Valkyrie, BlackRock, Bitwise, Invesco and WisdomTree enter the race for an ETF approval, they all equally aim to provide investors with more accessible and regulated avenues to participate in the bitcoin market. These developments underscore the continued growth and maturation of the bitcoin industry, with ETFs emerging as an important tool for investors seeking exposure to bitcoin in a regulated manner, albeit at the cost of certain properties inherent only to native bitcoin.]]></summary>
