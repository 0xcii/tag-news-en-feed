        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With over $90 billion worth in crypto inflows, Argentina has been declared Latin America’s leading market for cryptocurrency, dethroning Brazil. The growing instability and unpredictability in the economy as well as inflation has forced people of the country to explore the decentralized world of crypto, immediately making them key players in their region. In fact, it is responsible for almost 25% of the total crypto inflows of Latin America, outweighing that of Brazil at 18%, data from Chainalysis shows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price briefly crashed below $60,000 for the first time since September. This price decline followed the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data, which came in higher than expected. This macro data and factors like the US presidential elections are causing market uncertainty, leading to a bearish outlook for the flagship crypto. 
 
Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed Below $60,000
 
The Bitcoin price crashed below $60,000 following the release of the US CPI inflation data. The CPI showed that inflation in the US hit 2.4% in September, higher than expectations. This provided a bearish outlook for BTC, suggesting that the Fed’s 50 basis points (bps) rate cut might not happen at the November FOMC meeting as expected.
