These reasons relate to the meme coin’s fundamentals, which paint a bullish outlook for it. 
 
Why Shiba Inu Could Be The Best Bet This Cycle
 
Shiba Inu could be the best bet in this cycle because of its burn rate. The number of tokens burned continues to spike, which opens up the possibility of the meme coin becoming more valuable and enjoying significant price rallies. Recently, the burn rate spiked by over 7,900%, a development that could catalyze the price surge to $0.00008.

Despite the surge, analysts and investors remain wary, as BTC has repeatedly dropped from these levels since March, leading to concerns about another potential decline. 
 
The question on everyone’s mind is whether Bitcoin can break through this resistance or if history will repeat itself.
 
 
Key data shared by a top analyst reveals that many open positions on Binance are shorts, signaling bearish sentiment among traders. This has led to predictions of an impending drop for Bitcoin, further fueling caution in the market.
