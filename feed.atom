This is an opinion editorial by Rebel Money, a visual artist who focuses on Bitcoin themes and advocates for other artists in the space.
For centuries, the traditional art market has been dominated by established auction houses and galleries, where works of art are sold for millions of dollars. Despite its longevity, the art market has been criticized for its opaqueness, exclusivity and the difficulties faced by new collectors when navigating its intricacies.

        <updated>2023-04-25T18:10:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent local reports have brought to light that Shin Hyun-seong, also known as Daniel Shin, co-founder of Terraform Labs, has been indicted by the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office on charges of fraud. Along with nine others, Shin is suspected of deceiving investors and accumulating around 460 billion won ($350M) before the Terra project ultimately failed.
 
Daniel Shin Indicted With 9 Other Terra Associates
 
KBS World, a regional South Korean publication, has revealed that ten individuals, including Daniel Shin, have been indicted in South Korea. Although they have not been detained, the suspects have been charged with financial law violations, embezzlement, and fraud. The South Korean authorities suspect that this group of individuals raised 460 billion won ($350M) through unlawful means linked to the Terra blockchain project.
 
According to the KBS report, Shin was responsible for supervising terrausd (UST) (now known as USTC) payments for four years, starting from July 2018. Prosecutors have reason to believe that false advertising was utilized during this period. Seven of the ten suspects who were indicted worked for Terraform Labs, while one was Shin’s financial broker. Although the prosecution is aiming to seize 246.8 billion won ($184.7M), the process has been far from smooth.
 
 
In a recent ruling, the court in Seoul stated that the original Terra asset, now referred to as LUNC, is not a security. As a result, the Seoul prosecutors’ office had difficulty confiscating Daniel Shin’s cryptocurrency assets due to this provision. After eleven months of investigations, the Seoul prosecutors’ office is now bringing the accused to trial. Notably, the indictment report does not mention co-founder Kwon Do-hyeong, commonly known as Do Kwon.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has filed a legal action to ask the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to clarify regulations for the crypto industry. The filing follows a July 2022 petition from Coinbase asking the SEC to use formal rulemaking to provide guidance for the crypto sector. Coinbase claims that the SEC has not yet responded to its petition, so it has filed the legal challenge to compel the SEC to respond either positively or negatively to its request.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While several top digital assets have decreased in value against the U.S. dollar over the past month, the stablecoin economy has lost $2.4 billion in value since March 31, 2023. Four of the top five stablecoins experienced net redemptions over the last 30 days, except for tether, which grew by 2.3% during that time.
 
Four of the Top Five Stablecoins Experience Net Redemptions in the Past 30 Days
 
On March 31, 2023, the top stablecoins by market capitalization represented $133.63 billion in value, and now the valuation is down to $131.21 billion. A total of $2.4 billion worth of stablecoins has been withdrawn from the stablecoin economy since then. Data reveals that over the past 30 days, USDC, BUSD, DAI, and TUSD have all seen redemptions. Usd coin’s (USDC) circulating supply dropped 10.2% compared to last month, and binance usd (BUSD) fell by 20.6%. Of the top five largest stablecoins, both USDC and BUSD experienced the most redemptions.
 
 
Further, DAI’s circulating supply slipped 9% lower in 30 days and TUSD’s supply decreased by 0.7%. Tether (USDT), however, grew 2.3% since last month, reaching a market capitalization worth $81.39 billion. Tether’s market valuation accounts for 61.65% of the entire stablecoin economy’s $131.21 billion value. While tether’s supply grew by 2.3%, pax dollar (USDP) rose by 33.9% since last month.
 
 
USDP now has a market valuation of approximately $1,037,832,268. Both frax dollar and Tron’s USDD experienced losses during the past 30 days; frax dollar (FRAX) shed 3.8% while USDD lost 1% of its circulating supply. Gemini’s dollar-pegged token GUSD saw its supply increase by 18.1% to $465.22 million. Liquity usd (LUSD) recorded a 2.4% rise, and magic internet money (MIM) increased by 5.9% last month. The entire stablecoin economy represents 11.02% of the crypto economy’s $1.19 trillion net value.

The report from the DOJ revealed that it charged three people for the conspiracy. The other two individuals were charged for playing significant roles in facilitating the scheme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon fell to a six-week low on Tuesday, with sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remaining bearish. The price plunged as consumer confidence in the United States fell by more than expected, coming in at a reading of 101.3 in April. Solana also slipped, hitting a two-week low.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) dropped to a six-week low on Tuesday, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remained bearish.
 
MATIC/USD dropped for a third straight session, hitting an intraday low of $0.9633 in the process.
 
The move came less than a day after polygon was trading at a peak of $1.01, with today’s fall sending it to its weakest point since March 10.
 
 
As a result of the sell-off, it appears that MATIC bears are targeting a floor at the $0.95 mark.
 
From the chart, one of the catalysts for the drop seems to be a breakout that occurred on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
The index fell below a floor at 32.00, and is currently tracking at 31.13, which is its lowest reading since last June.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was another notable mover on Tuesday, as the token moved closer to a floor at $20.00.
 
Following a high of $21.95 to start the week, SOL/USD dropped to a low of $20.92 earlier in today’s session.
 
Today’s slippage sent solana to its lowest level since April 11, when price fell to a bottom at $20.83.
 
 
At the time of writing, SOL has somewhat risen from its earlier low, and is currently trading at $20.95.
 
In addition to this, the RSI indicator continues to track near a floor at 42.00, with a present reading of 42.66.
 
Should it fall below this point of support, it is highly likely that solana will drop below $20.00.

While April 2023 has been an eventful month for the crypto industry, the news about Daniel’s indictment by South Korean prosecutors was met with little to no surprise.
 
Do Kwon, founder of Terraform Labs and Daniel Shin’s partner, was reportedly arrested last month in Montenegro on charges of capital markets violation and fraud, as reported by Bloomberg. 
 
Since the TerraLuna crash, Do Kwon has been in the limelight of multiple controversies and is currently wanted in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system.
