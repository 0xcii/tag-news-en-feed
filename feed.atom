        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by global trade volume, Binance, has announced it is discontinuing support for the stablecoin asset BUSD. The trading platform is encouraging users to swap their BUSD as Binance gradually phases out BUSD markets.
 
BUSD Support Ending on Binance, Users Told to Swap Tokens
 
On August 31, Binance disclosed BUSD support will be phased out and the exchange is asking users to convert BUSD to other stablecoins before February 2024. The blog post notes the issuer of BUSD, Paxos, has halted minting the stablecoin and Binance is offering no-fee swaps if customers convert BUSD balances into FDUSD.
 
On Sept. 7, Binance will suspend BUSD loans on cross margins and on Oct. 19, cross-margin and portfolio margin users will no longer be able to transfer additional BUSD as new collateral to the platform’s cross-margin wallet. “Withdrawals of Binance-Peg BUSD tokens via BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Tron, and Optimism networks will cease [on September 7],” the exchange disclosed.
 
Other suspension announcements say support will continue “until further announcements.” Several other phase-out BUSD dates are listed for Binance’s loan and earn programs. BUSD has seen its supply gradually decline since Paxos was told by U.S. regulators it could no longer mint BUSD.
 
 
The stablecoin’s market valuation is just above the $3 billion range, while there’s 327 million FDUSD in circulation today. Binance’s announcement notes that while BUSD is being discontinued, the exchange assures that “BUSD will always be backed 1:1 by USD.”
 
Meanwhile, Binance commands a majority of the TUSD supply according to Nansen analytics which shows the exchange’s TUSD stash represents more than 5% of its reserves. Binance further controls more than $17 billion worth of tether (USDT).

Bitcoin Trading Volume Has Registered A Large Boost Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, BTC continues to see high volumes. The “trading volume” here refers to measuring the daily total amount of a specific asset being moved around on the blockchain.
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means that many tokens of the cryptocurrency in question are currently observing some movement. Such a trend implies that traders are active in the market right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase has listed Paypal’s PYUSD stablecoin, following an announcement of its support for the digital asset just a day earlier. Should liquidity requirements be satisfied, the exchange plans to introduce trading pairs for the asset in stages.
 
Coinbase Adds PYUSD Stablecoin
 
Coinbase, the prominent cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in San Francisco, has incorporated Paypal’s dollar-tied token, PYUSD, into its offerings. The firm broke the news on Wednesday, mentioning that trading would commence at 9 a.m. PT on Thursday, provided “liquidity conditions were met.”
 
“Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our PYUSD-USD trading pairs will launch in phases,” elaborated Coinbase. “Support for PYUSD may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions.” The exchange also emphasized that PYUSD operates as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network, cautioning users against transferring the asset through alternate networks to avoid potential losses.
 

 
According to a recent Bitcoin.com News report, PYUSD’s supply experienced a spike leaping from 26.9 million to 43.3 million PYUSD. However, despite the recent addition to Coinbase, PYUSD’s activity remains limited, recording merely 1,587 transfers and boasting 388 holders. As of 12:30 p.m. ET on August 31, the exchange’s web portal says PYUSD can be acquired via Coinbase.
 
 
Our report on PYUSD highlighted that other digital currency platforms, such as Crypto.com, Uniswap, Gate.io, Bitmart, and Bybit, also support the token. On Thursday specifically, a labeled Coinbase wallet possesses around 1,005,467 PYUSD, ranking it as the fifth-largest PYUSD wallet as of August 31. This means the Coinbase wallet accounts for approximately 2.3221% of the total supply of Paypal’s stablecoin token.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin stayed close to a two-week high on Thursday, as markets rebounded from a slight sell-off during yesterday’s session. Traders moved to secure profits over the last 24 hours, following strong gains on Tuesday. Solana neared a drop below $20.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) remained close to a multi-week high during today’s session, as bulls attempted to maintain recent pressure.
 
After sliding to a low of $0.06468 on Wednesday, DOGE/USD moved to a peak of $0.06692 earlier today.
 
This was marginally below Tuesday’s high of $0.0687, which is the strongest level the meme coin had hit since mid-August.
 
 
Bullish momentum has eased in recent days since the relative strength index (RSI) collided with a resistance level of 48.00.
 
Price strength has since tailed off, and at the time of writing this is now tracking at the 45.92 mark.
 
Should a break out of the aforementioned ceiling take place in the coming days, bulls will likely attempt to take the price above $0.0700.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
On the other hand, solana (SOL) extended a recent losing streak on Thursday, with the price moving closer to a drop below $20.00.
 
SOL/USD bottomed out at $20.55 earlier in today’s session, which comes following a high of $21.01 the day prior.
 
The recent shift in sentiment comes as solana bulls were unable to orchestrate a move beyond a resistance level of $22.
 
 
It now seems inevitable that the token will fall to a floor at $20, depending on where the RSI lands.
 
As of writing this, the index is at a reading of 41.73, with a support point of 39.00 a possible target for sellers.
 
Solana could drop under the $20.00 level in the not-too-distant future, in the event this floor is hit.
