        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam Bankman-Fried, the Founder of the collapsed  
cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison by Judge Lewis  
A. Kaplan on Thursday. Bankman-Fried was found guilty on multiple counts of

causing millions of losses to investors.
The legal tussle reached its climax with the recent  
sentencing, where prosecutors sought a staggering 40 to 50 years behind bars

defense team remains undeterred, vowing to appeal both the conviction and the  
sentencing.
