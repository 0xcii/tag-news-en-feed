Around 55% Of Total Bitcoin Supply Has Been Underwater Recently
 
As per CryptoQuant’s year-end dashboard release, this metric reached a value of 60% during previous bottoms. The “supply in loss” is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that’s currently carrying some loss.
 
The metric works by looking at the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous value for any coin was greater than the latest BTC price, then that particular coin is carrying some loss at the moment, and the indicator accounts for it.

This is an opinion editorial by Dillon Healy, a member of the institutional partnerships team at Bitcoin Magazine and The Bitcoin Conference.
A topic that has received increased attention lately is the concern around Bitcoin’s future “security budget.”
This mainly stems from the worry that miner revenue will not be enough to offer adequate security in the future, post block subsidy. Bitcoin miners play a crucial part in securing the network by proposing blocks of transactions which nodes then verify, accept and update to the Bitcoin ledger. Competing against other miners to propose this new block to the chain, miners use intense computing power to com…]]></summary>
