To help law enforcement track illegal funds, an increasingly constraining set of anti-money-laundering measures is being implemented across the globe. For the past two decades, it has involved extensive know-your-customer obligations for financial institutions, forced to check their clients’ identities, backgrounds, and the nature of their activities. This system, based on surveillance and the presumption of guilt, has helped the global financial system to efficiently fight criminals by cutting off their money flows.

Identifying the wealthiest bitcoin holders can be difficult, and asking them to reveal the full details of their security is unlikely to be successful. However, the bitcoin blockchain provides us with some valuable information. The transaction history and balances of all bitcoin addresses is publicly-available knowledge.

ETH Price Set To Rise To $14,000
 
Analysts at Standard Chartered Bank have maintained an optimistic outlook for ETH, anticipating that the second-largest cryptocurrency could witness an exponential surge to $14,000 by 2025. 
 
 
Detailed in a Monday note, the analysts revealed key factors that could drive Ethereum towards the predicted price target. Notably, the potential approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a primary catalyst for ETH’s projected surge.
