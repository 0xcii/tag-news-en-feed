        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, is “experiencing a system-wide outage” that has directly impacted its services. Both desktop and mobile platforms of the crypto exchange are not working.
Coinbase Is Down
The reason behind the outage remains unclear as the exchange ensured that it is “investigating this issue.” According to the status page of Coinbase, the outage started at 21:19 Pacific Daylight Time on 13 May.
Addressing its users, the exchange further noted: “Your funds are safe.”

Coinbase is experiencing a system wide outage. We are investigating this issue and working on a solution. Please see https://t.co/a3pl4WiDhZ for updates. Your funds are safe.
— Coinbase Support (@CoinbaseSupport) May 14, 2024
A Platform-Wide Outage
An attempt to visit the Coinbase website shows the message “503 service temporarily unavailable.” According to Mozilla, the server throws a 503 error when it is not ready to handle requests due to overload or maintenance.
Interestingly, the mobile app of the crypto exchange is showing that “planned maintenance [is] in progress,” which is wrong.

Ahhhh, the app is saying this is "planned maintenance." pic.twitter.com/U6bd0NtH2c
— Metaman (@FacebookZucks) May 14, 2024
The outage even affected the self-custody platform of the exchange, Coinbase Wallet, which is showing the message “something went wrong” and suggesting some unnecessary instructions like forcefully quitting the app and making sure it's updated.
