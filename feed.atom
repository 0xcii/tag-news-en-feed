        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marathon Digital Holdings, a public Bitcoin miner, has received another subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding whether there were possible violations of federal securities law in agreements related to a Hardin, Montana data center facility that Marathon built. 
“The Company and certain of its executives received a subpoena to produce documents and communications,” related to the facility in the third quarter of 2021, a quarterly filing by the company stated. 
In that agreement, Marathon issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted Common Stock, “in transactions exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.” However, the company filing revealed that it recently received another subpoena from the SEC on April 10, 2023, “relating to, among other things, transactions with related parties." 
The company says it is cooperating with the investigation. The facility in Montana was designed to have up to 100-megawatts of power, according to the filing.
Marathon’s stock price has been volatile in recent months, reflecting the ups and downs of the bitcoin market, however, the stock has generally followed an upward trend since early 2021, as the value of bitcoin has risen.]]></summary>

As in most cases, when a company undergoes bankruptcy, users are the most affected. Per a Bloomberg report, some BlockFi users have been denied access to the possibility of recovering their funds as they unintentionally forfeit their right over the crypto held on the lending platform.
 
 
Poor Communications Affect BlockFi Users’
 
The decision was ruled by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan, according to the report. The judge dismissed BlockFi customers’ arguments if they held coins earning interest on the platform. In this case, these user…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase,  
the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, is facing backlash on  
Twitter for a newsletter article published on its website. In the article, the  
author described Ethereum-based meme coin, Pepe, as a coin “that has been  
co-opted as a hate symbol by alt-right groups,” citing the Anti-Defamation  
League for the description. 
Pepe, which  
was launched in mid-April, is named after the Pepe the Frog internet meme. Over the  
weekend, the meme coin became  
the fastest Ethereum token to hit the $1 billion mark as meme coin trading topped $2.3 billion during the  
past week. However,  
the market capitalization of Pepe has dropped significantly in the past seven  
days, from about $1.65 billion to about $627 million, according to  
CoinMarketCap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark has issued a warning about Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin emitter, USDT. In his opinion, Tether could be the next domino to fall, and its promise of transparency and audits may not be enough to prevent that from happening.
 
Is Tether’s Future In Jeopardy?
 
Stark, who has 35 years of experience studying markets and financial statements, including 18 years as an attorney in the SEC Enforcement Division, believes that Tether is a “mammoth house of cards” that could collapse at any moment. He argues that the company’s lack of transparency and its opaque relationship with its banking partners create significant risks for investors and the wider financial system.

While it’s not easy to get tens of thousands of individual computers to agree, getting thousands of humans to agree is arguably the greater challenge.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin was back above $80.00 on Wednesday, as the token climbed away from a recent six-week low. Today’s rise in price sees the cryptocurrency surge for a third straight day, despite recent market volatility. Cardano was also marginally higher.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) jumped back above $80.00 earlier in today’s session, as the token continued to move away from recent lows.
 
Following yesterday’s low of $78.18, LTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $81.97 on Thursday.
 
The surge saw litecoin rise from a recent six-week low of $75.32, which took the cryptocurrency to a breakout of a floor at $77.00.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s rally pushed the relative strength index (RSI) towards a resistance level of 39.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is currently tracking at 37.95, with LTC falling from earlier highs, and trading at $80.84.
 
Bulls in the market are likely targeting a ceiling of $85.00, however there will likely be some hurdles in the form upcoming points of resistance.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was also marginally higher, as prices traded close to a key support level on Wednesday.
 
ADA/USD hit a high of $0.3727 earlier in the day, which comes following a bottom at $0.3574 during yesterday’s session.
 
Thursday’s marginal gain sees cardano climb above a price floor of $0.3580, however earlier momentum has somewhat faded.
 
 
It appears that gains have eased due to the RSI colliding with a ceiling at the 41.00 mark.
 
Price strength is now at the 37.06 level, after failing to break out of the aforementioned resistance.
 
ADA is now trading at $0.3613, with bearish pressure significantly higher than earlier in the day.

He's also figuring out how to upend what it means to be a music fan. The band launched a Deathbats Club NFT collection in 2021. That is to say: They were early. The lead singer said it was timed to give fans a chance to get comfortable with Web3 technology ahead of the group's 2023 tour, when the NFT holders can use their Deathbats for early access to tickets. M. Shadows also talked to hosts Andrew Hayward and Stephen Graves about AI and bringing Web3 into gaming.]]></summary>

But the tides started to turn because even if exploiting a smart contract nets a bigger payday than a bounty, it comes with a huge drawback. "There's a ton of risk when you engage in this, you know, wantonly criminal behavior and steal $200 million from someone else," he said. "There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>

And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>
