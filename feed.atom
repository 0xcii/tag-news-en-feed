        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s the main reason behind cryptocurrencies’ success? One word – decentralization. Bitcoin offers what global banks can’t. Every major bank you know or are a client of is centralized and, thus, controlled by a central authority. This means you can freely own and control your funds, but your bank account is reliant on banking intermediaries. 
 
With Bitcoin, this isn’t the case. Without intermediaries and by utilizing blockchain technology, transaction fees are reduced significantly, and you can transfer your funds without geographic restrictions. However, it doesn’t mean you can buy Bitcoin anonymously without effort. You still have to provide personal details due to financial regulations, even in the crypto world. Not to mention the fact you can connect a person’s identity with their B…]]></summary>

A report from the New York Times has revealed a rather interesting gamble by filmmaker Carl Erik Rinsch. Rinsch reportedly had a well sought-after series he wanted to develop, and would eventually score a deal with streaming giant Netflix to produce the series as a Netflix original.
