too early to talk about a speculative cryptocurrency rally like the ones  
Bitcoin (BTC) has historically offered, something is definitely going on. Just

Along with  
the rising price, investor expectations and dreams are also soaring, with some  
already mentally cashing in above-average profits. The fear-of-missing-out

#1 BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Looms Large
 
The primary driver behind the surge seems to be the growing anticipation surrounding the possible green light for a Spot Bitcoin ETF. The epicenter of this surge is the potential approval of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF.
 
Fueling these speculations was a revelation from Scott Johnsson, a respected finance lawyer from Davis Polk. He noted, “So two things caught my eye from the latest iShares (Blackrock) S-1 amendment: They’ve obtained a CUSIP in preparation for a launch. They may be looking to seed with cash this month.”
