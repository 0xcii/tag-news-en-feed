        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a bid to curb capital flight, money laundering, and potentially risky speculation, the Financial Services Commission of South Korea has proposed an amendment restricting the use of domestic crypto credit cards for purchasing cryptocurrency on foreign exchanges.
 
This move by the country’s top financial regulator targets a loophole that has allowed Korean citizens to circumvent existing regulations limiting cryptocurrency purchases using traditional credit cards.
 
 
The proposed amendment, if implemented, would further tighten South Korea’s grip on the burgeoning crypto market, raising questions about its potential impact on individual financial freedom and the broader adoption of digital assets within the country.
