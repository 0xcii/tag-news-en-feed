I grew up in Germany as the oldest of four brothers. My father worked at the local energy company but outside of that he was always politically active. Aged 16, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) — equivalent to the Democrats in the USA. His

It has proven versatile and stable across upheavals and social changes. It even became a vital tool in global trade and currency exchange as we know it today.
In the 19th century, gold was the backbone of the global monetary system. Nations relied on the gold standard until the Great Depression and World War I. These events were significant inflationary catalysts, and economies, in a decades-long transition, abandoned the gold standard. 
This process culminated in 1971 when the Federal Exchange could no longer exchange US dollars for gold. In 1976, the gold standard was abandoned entirely, and gold became a free asset.

The Role of Ordinals in Bitcoin
Bitcoin ordinals refer to the unique identification numbers assigned to each satoshi on the blockchain. They serve as a timestamp and help establish the order in which satoshis occur. Ordinal theory enables participants to verify the chronology of satoshis, ensuring that the network reaches a consensus on the state of the blockchain.
When a Bitcoin transaction takes place, it is recorded on the blockchain, which is essentially a decentralized ledger. Each satoshi is assigned a unique ordinal number, which acts as a digital fingerprint. This ordinal number is generated using complex cryptographic algorithms, making it virtually impossible to tamper with or forge.
