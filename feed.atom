Cryptocurrency investors are about to get the opportunity to buy into some brand new exchnage-listed products in the coming days or weeks, pending final confirmation from the regulator.
The long-held opposition on part of the chief US financial regulator and its Chair Gary Gensler to the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap receiving a dedicated ETF listed on US exchanges, has been largely overcome, and not without political pressure.
