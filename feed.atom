        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a disclosure on Wednesday, bitcoin mining entity Cleanspark has reserved 4.4 exahash per second (EH/s) of Bitmain’s latest S21 Antminers. The mining company, recognized on the public market, detailed that the consignment is valued at approximately $61.6 million, translating to $14 for each terahash per second (TH/s).
 
Cleanspark Amplifies Mining Capabilities, Snags 4.4 EH/s of Bitmain’s S21 Antminers
 
Cleanspark (Nasdaq: CLSK), a U.S.-based bitcoin mining firm, divulged its procurement of 4.4 EH/s of the fresh S21 miners from mining equipment titan Bitmain. Though the specifics were not openly shared, the dispatch indicates that the Bitmain S21 Antminers boast an efficiency quotient of 17.5 joules per terahash (J/TH), suggesting the purchase likely involved the air-cooled S21 models.
 
These air-cooled S21 models yield 200 TH/s each, necessitating 22,000 units for the company to hit the 4.4 EH/s mark. The apparatuses hold a cumulative worth of $61.6 million, as per Cleanspark.
 
Bitmain is fronting the capital for the residual 20%, with the balance postponed until a year post-delivery, indicating an upfront disbursement of $11.2 per TH/s. The announcement underscores that shipments are slated to kick off in January 2024.
 
 
This acquisition by Cleanspark comes on the heels of Iris Energy securing 1.4 EH/s of Bitmain’s S21 hardware for $19.6 million. Bitcoin mining conglomerates are bracing for the impending reward halving, a mere 196 days out, and enhancing the joules per terahash ratio is crucial for augmenting revenue streams.
 
“Integrating the S21 into our mining operations is in line with our commitment to using the most efficient mining technology,” Zach Bradford, CEO of Cleanspark, explained on Wednesday.

That there are fewer transactions suggests that holders are unwilling to sell and are more inclined to HODL.
 
 
Bitcoin On-chain Transactions Shrinking
 
Another notable finding from this data shows that 95% of all circulating BTC supply has not changed hands in the last month. This further cements analysts’ view that more holders are not ready to change ownership, directly contributing to the shallow levels of transfers in the last three months.

In a press release jointly issued with technology partner Emtech, the Ghanaian central bank said the hackathon will run for a period of 12 weeks. During this time, innovators are expected to come up with solutions that address financial inclusion challenges.

“The project is a part of the e-cedi research project and presents an opportunity for the Bank to explore emerging technologies, foster creativity and contribute to the advancement of the e-cedi development.”
 
Meanwhile, the Ghanaian central bank stated that individuals and teams with a passion for the technology are eligible to join the hackathon. Among the nine use cases that the BOG wants developers and innovators to focus on is the use of the e-cedi in merchant transactions.
