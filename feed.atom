Why “Solana Is Ethereum”
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Yakovenko elaborated on his “Solana is Ethereum” comment as he stated that THE NETWORK is also a layer-2 network for Ethereum through the “wormhole eigenlayer.” With this, Yakovenko raised the prospect of Solana and Ethereum being interoperable despite operating different protocols and consensus mechanisms.

In their 2023 Crypto Crime Report, Chainalysis alleged that YieldNodes, a Hong Kong based project which rents out computing power to participate in a masternode pool, is a scam. In their crypto scam activity summarized graph, Chainalysis depicted YieldNodes as the second largest crypto scam in revenue of 2022 with a total of $341.6M.

Crypto: Boon Or Bane?
 
Proponents of cryptocurrencies paint a vibrant picture of a decentralized utopia, free from the shackles of traditional finance. They tout the potential for financial inclusion, borderless transactions, and secure digital identities.
 
However, the RBI views such promises with a degree of skepticism. In their eyes, crypto’s inherent volatility and lack of regulatory oversight pose a clear and present danger to India’s financial stability…]]></summary>

The drainer uses Google search and X ads phishing links as a distribution vector and has affected over 63,000 victims as of December 21.
MS Drainer Allows Criminals to Siphon Over $58 Million
A recent report from Scam Sniffer, an anti-scam platform used by several Web3 wallets, has revealed that a certain malware type has managed to siphon over $58 million from cryptocurrency holders. The tool, called MS Wallet Drainer, attacks the cryptocurrency wallets (Ethereum, BNB, and other EVM chains and rollups) of victims using Google and X ads to infect their devices and drain them of any available funds and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
The malware is distributed using the search results of Google searches for popular cryptocurrency sites and decentralized finance exchanges, such as Zapper, Lido, Stargate, Defillama, Orbiter Finance, and Radiant. The same malware was also detected in a series of Ordinals-related X ads, and a recent sampling of X ads on some feeds resulted in more than 60% of the ads leading to sites using the MS Drainer.
The report highlights that these ads use several techniques to obfuscate their purposes and pass advertising audits. For example, they only target certain regions and use redirection to bypass revisions.
One of the victims lost over $24 million in an Ethereum wallet, while another lost over $1 million in Ethereum assets. An investigation revealed that the tool is available in darknet forums with a price of $1,500 for a standard functionality set. While other similar malware tools are fully managed and charge a 20% fee, this one only charges for modules that add additional functionality to the standard package.
