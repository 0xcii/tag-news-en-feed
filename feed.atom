        <link href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-ripple-falls-victim-to-massive-hack-over-213-million-xrp-stolen/"/>
        <updated>2024-01-31T15:03:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain payment firm Ripple has recently experienced a significant security breach, resulting in the loss of a substantial amount of XRP. 
 
The hack, uncovered by decentralized finance (DeFi) detective ZachXBT, has raised serious concerns about the protocol’s security and triggered a series of illicit transactions involving the stolen XRP. 
 
XRP Hack Rocks Ripple
 
According to investigations, the hack led to the theft of over 213 million XRP, valued at over $112 million. The stolen funds were subsequently laundered through cryptocurrency exchanges, including MEXC, Gate, Binance, Kraken, OKX, HTX, HitBTC, and several undisclosed platforms. 
 
 
As seen in the image below, the criminals behind the security breach conducted eight transactions to different addresses, as revealed by the blockchain.
 
 
XRP Price Dips Further After Hack
 
Following the security breach, XRP’s price plummeted to $0.5070 and continued to decline further, hitting a low of $0.4860 on Wednesday. 
 
The hack news intensified the token’s downward trend, which has already experienced a 19% decline over the past 30 days and a 4% decline in the past 24 hours. 
 
 
The next steps that Ripple will take to address the security breach remain uncertain. The company’s response to the situation and measures to fortify its security infrastructure will be closely monitored. 
 
As of this writing, Ripple officials have not released any official statements regarding the hack, leaving the situation in a critical state. 
 
 
As seen on the 1-day chart of XRP, the next major support for the token is placed at the $0.4876 level, which prevented a further decline after the news was released. If this level fails to hold a potential continuation of the downtrend, the next support for the token is placed at $0.4686.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The European Union published a report on Bitcoin and the BTC mining industry and its potential implications for three key sectors. The document hints at what many in the crypto space fear: the region is moving to ban Proof-of-Work within its borders.
 
 
Bitcoin Legality In Jeopardy?
 
According to Daniel Batten, a managing partner for CH4 Capital, the European Commission created this report through two institutions: the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
 
The documents target Bitcoin from different angles, including its alleged negative impact on the environment, its “threat” to the region’s energy security, and its capacity to support criminal activities allegedly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A British citizen recently went on trial in the U.K. for laundering bitcoins on behalf of a fugitive Chinese fraudster, Yadi Zhang. Prosecutors insist that Jian Wen was aware that Zhang’s bitcoins were acquired using stolen funds. However, Wen defended her actions and said she thought Zhang had accumulated her wealth through her jewelry business, property portfolio, and bitcoin mining operation. 
 
Zhang’s Wealth Management Business
 
A British-Chinese woman, Jian Wen, is on trial in the U.K. for allegedly laundering bitcoins that were sourced with $6.3 billion stolen from more than 128,000 investors in China. According to prosecutors, Wen is facing three charges of laundering money on behalf of the Chinese national Yadi Zhang.
 
Zhang, a fugitive from justice, is said to have perpetrated the grand fraud via her bogus wealth management business between 2014 and 2017. Afterwards, she reportedly converted some of the stolen money to bitcoin (BTC) before leaving for London under a false identity.
 
Upon arriving in the U.K., Zhang sought the services of Wen to convert her BTC into cash, jewellery, and other luxury items. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) alleges that Zhang’s ultimate objective was “to disguise the true source of the funds.”
 
 
During the trial, Gillian Jones, who represented the CPS, stated that while Wen was not involved in the fraud, she may have known that Zhang’s bitcoins were proceeds from criminal activity. Jones urged the jury to ask Wen if she was aware of Zhang’s criminal activities.
 
The lawyer argued that Wen, a naturalized British citizen, knowingly acted as a front for Zhang and was probably paid for it. However, Wen defended her actions and said she thought Zhang had accumulated her wealth through her jewellery business, property portfolio, and bitcoin mining operation.
 
The trial is expected to run until early March, according to the report.

In a detailed exposition shared via X (formerly Twitter), Batten stated: “While we were sleeping, the European Commission (via ESMA & ECB) has been creating a report which they plan to label Bitcoin – environmentally harmful – a threat to EU energy security – a haven for financial criminals. This paves the way for 2025 de facto EU bans on BTC & BTC mining.”

On Tuesday, January 30, the SEC announced its intention to dismiss its high-profile case against the crypto firm DEBT Box.
 
The case, which originally accused DEBT Box of defrauding investors out of nearly $50 million by selling unregistered securities, took an unexpected turn when the SEC sought to withdraw their lawsuit. This decision follows a series of events where the SEC faced potential sanctions from Judge Robert Shelby of the Northern Division District Court of Utah for reportedly misleading the court.
