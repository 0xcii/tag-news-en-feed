        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant development, Binance revealed that it will no longer be supporting its BUSD stablecoin. Binance will remove BUSD from both spot and margin trading pairings in a staggered manner, encouraging users to move their BUSD holdings to other assets.
 
The exchange made a calculated decision with this choice, forcing consumers to adjust to shifting trading pairings and look into other stablecoin possibilities in the constantly changing cryptocurrency market.
 
The move, which takes effect on December 15, 2023, is a result of regulatory pressure that Paxos, the BUSD issuer, had to deal with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the complex realm of cryptocurrency regulation, the  
U.S. Treasury has boldly extended its reach, seeking  
expanded powers that transcend national borders. Deputy Secretary of the  
Treasury Wally Adeyemo's impassioned plea to Congress for extraterritorial  
control over stablecoins, notably targeting Tether, adds a layer of complexity  
to the ongoing domestic regulatory conundrum.
As Adeyemo presents a set of common-sense  
recommendations, it underscores the inherent challenges faced by the U.S. in  
regulating its burgeoning crypto industry. While the nation grapples with  
internal complexities, the audacious move raises a thought-provoking question:  
Can a country entrenched in domestic crypto intricacies successfully navigate  
the intricate global landscape?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ordinals protocol was introduced to Bitcoin in early 2023 at a most opportune time. Bitcoin had nearly two years of low transaction fees from the lack of demand to actually send Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin is considered to be the most secure blockchain in the world, but that security depends on miners who receive their revenue from transaction fees and block rewards. As part of the predetermined supply schedule, the block rewards are expected to be halved around April 2024 which would further drastically cut the miner revenue. To support the miners, Bitcoin needed something new to spur growth, and that was Ordinals. Ordinals drove huge demand to send Bitcoin transactions. Over $100 million (USD) worth of transaction fees have been spent so far this year just to create inscriptions, o…]]></summary>

Hartvigsen’s examination focuses on the technical aspects and key developments (apart from price speculation) within the SOL ecosystem that might pave the way for its widespread acceptance.

This sanction, issued on November 29, 2023, paves the way for the beleaguered crypto exchange to offload investments in several funds, including Grayscale and Bitwise stakes. Furthermore, the FTX Trading Ltd. record, maintained by restructuring entity Kroll, is swamped with the assignment of claims to new holders, as creditors opt to trade their claims for immediate financial gain.

Crypto Expert Believes XRP Price Is Suppressed
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, pro-XRP crypto YouTuber Jerry Hall stated that he believes that the price of the token has been suppressed for years. He noted that the moment he began to have this belief was when he realized that Ripple was selling into the market on a monthly basis. 
 
 
According to him, the fact that Ripple does this to finance their business shows that he and the company have different goals. He also seemed to suggest that Ripple didn’t care about XRP holders as he stated that “bag holders are …]]></summary>

sell approximately $873 million worth of assets held in trust. Around $700  
million of these assets are from Grayscale's primary offering, the Grayscale  
Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). 
The approval, dated November 29 and issued by a  
 bankruptcy court in Delaware, enables the defunct crypto exchange to liquidate  
holdings in trusts managed by Grayscale Investments and Bitwise. It marks a  
significant step in repaying creditors impacted by the collapse of the  
exchange.
The authorization was prompted by a motion filed by  
FTX's debtors on November 3, requesting the sale of six cryptocurrency trusts,  
including the GBTC, Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE),  
and Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund.

Although Ripple and Grayscale secured milestone victories over the SEC in October, regulators continue to scrutinize centralized exchanges and traditional institutes that support digital asset integration, and the latest legal drama involving Binance precisely proved this tendency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a claim from an individual asserting they had lost 139 bitcoin in a hack, where 83.65 BTC was utilized as a heightened fee to expedite its mining, Antpool has disclosed its readiness to reimburse the mistakenly paid fee. Antpool specified on November 30 that the individual has a deadline of December 10, 2023, to reclaim the fee from the mining pool. 
 
Deadline Announced by Antpool for Refunding Massive Bitcoin Transaction Fee in Suspected Hack Case
 
Recently, the cryptocurrency community observed an exceptionally large transaction fee, where 83.65 BTC, valued at over $3 million, was remitted to miners. This transaction, confirmed in block 818,087, was processed by Antpool, today’s most dominant mining pool by hashrate. Following this event, an unidentified user on the social media platform X disclosed that this fee originated from their bitcoin holdings, which were allegedly compromised by hackers.
 
The user also provided a signature, verifying their claim by signing a message with the private keys of the address. On November 30, Antpool issued a statement regarding the erroneously paid fee, declaring its readiness to refund the owner of the address. “On November 23rd, some user submitted 83 BTC as a gas fee,” Antpool disclosed. “The risk control system of Antpool temporarily froze the fee when packaging the transaction.”
 

Please contact us before 00:00 (UTC+8) on December 10, 2023 and verify personal identity in the following way. After verification, Antpool will refund the fee.
 
 
Confirming the user’s identity could be crucial for Antpool, as there’s a prevailing notion that the hacker might still possess the key, and the alleged victim might actually be the perpetrator. The user is required to sign the address and forward it to Antpool’s email for verification purposes.
