        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In South Korea, XRP, the native currency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), is king, not Bitcoin (BTC). According to Kaiko’s research, trading is concentrated chiefly on XRP, which stays ahead of Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH0, Solana (SOL), and other altcoins, including Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).
 
This data is based on information drawn from Upbit, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the country and one of the largest in altcoin trading. The Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) also regulates the exchange. 
 
South Koreans Prefer XRP Over Bitcoin

The IRS had initially demanded a range of records and data related to Kraken's U.S. clients. In response, Kraken objected to the demands, emphasizing its commitment to maintaining client privacy. The exchange engaged in a lengthy litigation process to challenge the summons.
