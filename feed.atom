Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Senator Roger Marshall (R-Kan) have introduced the “Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act Of 2022,” a bill which would have sweeping impacts on the privacy of bitcoin users.
If enacted, the bill would require custodial and self-custodial wallet providers and miners to implement know-your-customer (KYC) systems. It would also prohibit financial institutions from interacting with privacy tools such as CoinJoin in an effort to limit the ability of users to maintain their privacy. While the bill focuses on such measures in order to curb money laundering, tools such as CoinJoin simply restore the users’ ability t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana surged to a three-week high ahead of this afternoon’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting (FOMC). The token rose for a second consecutive day, hitting a key price ceiling in the process. Cardano mainly consolidated on Wednesday, as prices fell from a recent high.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was a notable gainer on Wednesday, as prices surged to a three-week high.
 
Following a low of $13.61 on Tuesday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $14.68 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result, solana moved to its strongest point since November 26, which is the last time prices were trading above a key ceiling of $14.70.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this resistance point has yet to be broken following today’s gains, with SOL trading at $14.67 as of writing.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also rose, and is currently tracking at 48.36, however it also failed to break out of a resistance level.
 
As of writing, the index remains below a ceiling of 49.00, which appears to be the main obstacle in place, preventing any further surges.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
On the other hand, cardano (ADA) moved away from a recent eight-day high, as price consolidated ahead of today’s FOMC meeting.
 
ADA/USD fell to a low of $0.3069 earlier in the day, which comes less than a day after hitting a peak at $0.3152.
 
This surge in price sent cardano to its strongest point since December 5, which is the last time price was above a ceiling of $0.3270.
 
 
From the chart, it can be seen that today’s price consolidation began following a failed breakout of the 46.00 ceiling on the RSI indicator.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 43.79, with momentum appearing to be heading for a floor at 37.60.
 
Should price strength reach this point, it is likely that ADA will be trading close to the $0.3000 support level.

This had sent market sentiment to one of its lowest points for the year 2022, falling deep into the ‘Extreme Fear’ territory. However, as the market has recovered with time, investors in the space have been able to take stock of losses and readjust, with the positive CPI report boosting the faith in the market. Now, sentiment has seen a marked uptick as bulls become stronger.
 
Bitcoin Investors Leave Extreme Fear Behind
 
Over the last couple of days, bitcoin investor sentiment had been steadily improving. Data from the Fear & Greed Index shows that while the market finished last month in extreme fear, the new month has seen better levels. A six-point increase from November’s 24 has put the index at…]]></summary>

The correctional facility has a reputation for its lack of hygiene, high risk of contracting diseases, rodent infestations, violence, and more. The former FTX CEO was arrested for his alleged participation in the downfall of his company. Customers lose billions in deposits.

Total Stablecoin Supply Is Down 8% From March 2022 Peak
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the stables observed expansion throughout 2020 and 2021. The relevant indicator here is the “stablecoin supply net position change,” which measures the net amount of capital flowing into or out of these fiat-tied tokens.
 
When the value of this metric is positive, it means the total supply of these assets is increasing in size right now as more tokens are being minted.
