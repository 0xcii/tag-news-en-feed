The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy reiterated its warnings about investing in crypto assets on social media platform X on Friday. “Investments in crypto asset securities can be exceptionally risky and are often volatile,” the authority wrote.

        <updated>2023-12-10T22:41:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new study has found that as much as 47% of Nigerians are actively engaged in crypto trading which is now increasingly incorporated in their financial lives. The analysis also showed that crypto ownership in the country grew by 15% between 2020 and 2023.
 
Cryptocurrencies No Longer Seen as Speculative Assets
 
According to an analysis carried out by Coin Journal, about 47% of Nigerians are actively engaged in crypto, which is now widely seen as an alternative to traditional financial systems. The analysis also showed that crypto ownership in the country grew by 15% between 2020 and 2023.
 
The growth in the number of Nigerians owning such digital assets comes despite the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s move to curtail their use. As previously reported by Bitcoin.com News, the central bank moved to vigorously enforce its Feb. 6, 2021 decision, which sought to exclude crypto entities from the banking system.
 

 
However, the depreciation of the Nigerian currency, which accelerated in the second half of 2023, and rising inflation, have pushed residents into digital assets like bitcoin (BTC) and USDT.
 
Max Coupland, commenting on the findings of his firm’s study, said, “The data reflects a significant departure from considering digital assets solely as speculative investments, illustrating a broader transformation in how individuals approach and incorporate cryptocurrencies into their financial lives.”
 
He added that the growth in the use of cryptocurrencies in not just Nigeria but across the world underlines their pivotal role in shaping the future of global finance.

Tourists in China and Singpoare Can Spend Digital Yuan
 
Singapore’s central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), announced Thursday “new digital finance and capital markets initiatives to expand its financial cooperation with China.”
 
One of the initiatives is a “cross-border e-CNY pilot between China and Singapore,” the MAS explained, adding that it and People’s Bank of China’s Digital Currency Institute (PBCDCI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on digital finance cooperation in 2020. The announcement details:
 

MAS and PBCDCI are embarking on a pilot that will allow travellers from both countries to use e-CNY for tourism spending in Singapore and China. This will enhance convenience for travellers when making purchases during their overseas travel.
 
 
China is at the forefront of central bank digital currency (CBDC) development, actively testing its e-CNY project. Since initiating digital yuan research, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has steadily expanded the pilot program’s reach. Presently, there are 26 pilot areas for digital yuan spread across China.
 
PBOC Governor Yi Gang disclosed in July that transactions utilizing China’s central bank digital currency reached 1.8 trillion yuan ($250 billion) at the end of June. In November, Standard Chartered Bank said that it had begun offering digital yuan exchange services in China. Moreover, the Chinese central bank and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) have entered the second phase of integrating digital yuan for payments and cross-border transactions within Hong Kong.
