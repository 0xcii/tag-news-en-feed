"This is a protocol similar to the Lightning Network," Super Testnet stated. "And that it is a layer 2 for Bitcoin payments, only in this one, unlike the Lightning Network, the two parties don't have to both be online, it's asynchronous. One party can send the other money then they're offline."
One of the features of Hedgehog channels is its simplicity compared to lightning channels, according to the project's Github. State updates in Hedgehog channels only require the sender to propose an update, which the recipient can then accept at their convenience.

A mechanism to timestamp the order of digital information without needing to depend on a centralized operator. A decentralized mechanism with no one in charge, that provides undeniably cryptographic guarantees around what data was added to the temporal record in what order. This property is the entire reason Bitcoin is useful as a form of digital money, without it there would be no way for the system to function at all without a centralized authority. 
All of these guarantees are provided by three simple technical building blocks: private/public key cryptography, merkle trees, and hash algorithms.

Data from crypto analytics firm Glassnode shows that the amount of SHIB held on exchanges has dropped to its lowest level since March 2022. This underscores the bullish sentiment among SHIB investors, as the decline in the meme coin’s supply invariably means that these investors are choosing to hold for the long term rather than offloading their holdings anytime soon.
