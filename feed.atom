        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. The cryptocurrency market lacks regulation, leading to potential risks for investors, including SIM-swap scams. By this technique, hackers manipulate mobile carrier customer service to gain access to a user’s phone number, allowing them to bypass security measures and access accounts. Bart Stephens, co-founder of Blockchain Capital, fell victim to a SIM-swap attack, resulting in a $6.3 million Bitcoin theft. He has filed a lawsuit against the hackers. From all this it’s clear there’s a lack of effective safeguards and timely notifications from mobile phone carriers. Jellyfish Mobile provides a solution to prevent SIM-swap attacks and other vulnerabilities arising from cell phone carriers’ negligence.

He denied a possible unified currency for all BRICS countries at this juncture. 
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov: ‘No One Is Talking About a Single Currency Now’
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated one of the objectives of the BRICS bloc was to achieve independence from the Western-controlled economic and payment system in its internal trade settlements and transactions.
