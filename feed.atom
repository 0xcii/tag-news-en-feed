        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As 2024 draws near and anticipation around the next Bitcoin halving continues to grow, crypto investors have become increasingly bullish. However, the halving, while being perhaps the most important event for each bull market, is not the only major event for investors to keep an eye on.
