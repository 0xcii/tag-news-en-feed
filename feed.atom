"In this situation,  
to safely protect the assets of customers currently in custody, Delio will  
inevitably suspend withdrawals as of June 14, 2023, 18:30, until the above

In a bold move, Paul Grewal, the company’s chief legal officer, has accused the regulator of preemptively imposing its authority and basing its proposed rules on unsubstantiated assumptions about cryptocurrency jurisdiction. 
 
This clash between Coinbase and the SEC highlights the growing tension between the cryptocurrency industry and regulatory bodies, igniting a fervent debate about the future of digital assets. 
 
As Coinbase challenges the SEC’s proposed rules, it raises important questions about the balance between innovation and regulation in the evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

So, what is it about? Last month, just two weeks before the SEC’s actions against Coinbase and Binance US, Prometheum received approval to become the first special purpose broker-dealer (SPBD) of its kind for securities with digital assets. In doing so, Prometheum became the first company to receive approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to provide custody of digital securities as a broke…]]></summary>
