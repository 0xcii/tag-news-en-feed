The association said Chair Gensler’s consistent public assertion that ‘everything other than bitcoin’ should be considered a security, raises concerns and creates, at the very least, an appearance of a closed-minded approach to this matter.
 
By repeatedly expressing this viewpoint, Chair Gensler has essentially pre-judged the core issue involved in enforcement proceedings related to digital assets.

years, cryptocurrency, a digital form of currency that runs independently of  
central banks, has received a lot of attention and appeal. While the impact of  
bitcoin on established economies is frequently addressed, the potential of  
cryptocurrency to fuel economic growth and development in emerging markets

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rise of  
cryptocurrencies in recent years has resulted in the emergence of novel  
financial services that use the potential of digital assets. Crypto-backed  
loans, which allow individuals to unlock the value of their cryptocurrencies  
without having to sell them, are one such business that is growing popularity. 
These loans are  
made possible through lending platforms, which connect borrowers and lenders in  
a decentralized fashion. This article delves into the concept of crypto-backed  
loans, their advantages, and how lending platforms are changing the financial

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin remained close to the $31,000 level on Friday, as momentum in the market continued to be bullish heading into the weekend. This comes ahead of the anticipated consumer sentiment report from the United States, which is expected to show an increase in overall consumer confidence. Ethereum also edged higher today, climbing above $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) remained close to $31,000 in today’s session, as traders prepared for the consumer sentiment report from the United States.
 
After dropping to a low of $30,273.22 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $31,256.86 earlier today.
 
As a result of the move, bitcoin neared a recent one-year high at $31,443, which was last Friday’s high.

Friday’s surge also led to a breakout of a key price ceiling at $30,800.
 
This appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI) running into its own resistance level at the 70.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $30,831.12.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) climbed above the $1,900 mark earlier in the day, however traders have already moved to consolidate gains.
 
ETH/USD briefly rose to an intraday high of $1,906.37 on Friday, but has since tailed off, and is now trading at $1,891.36.
 
Friday’s peak saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency come close to a collision with the resistance level at $1,910.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Looking at the chart, the RSI also neared a ceiling of its own, as it approached the 58.00 point of resistance.
 
In the event this level is broken, there is a strong possibility that ethereum could move beyond $1,930.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bill that aims to regulate cryptocurrencies and  
stablecoins in the UK has been approved by King Charles. Dubbed the Financial  
Services and Markets Act 2023, the new law classifies the trading of  
cryptocurrencies as a regulated activity and brings stablecoins under the scope  
of payment rules.
The Financial Services  
and Markets Act 2023 gives regulators more power to govern financial systems,  
including the digital assets. The bill, which got the approval of the upper house  
last week, permits the regulators, including the Financial  
Conduct Authority (FCA), the  
Bank of England, and the Payments Systems Regulator, to introduce new rules in  
the digital asset sector.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The South Korean government has ushered in an era of stricter regulation for digital assets with its latest Virtual Asset User Protection legislation. The law has been enacted as a response to a series of scandals that rocked the crypto market, including the implosion of coins created by Korean tech entrepreneur Do Kwon that aggravated a $2 trillion crypto-market downturn.
 
The landmark legislation, approved on Friday, is South Korea’s first comprehensive crypto regulation framework. It was formulated by integrating 19 pre-existing crypto-related bills. The law formally characterizes digital assets and sets out punitive measures for various offenses, including insider trading, market manipulation, and illicit trading practices.

Senator Elizabeth Warren has expressed concerns regarding the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit activities, specifically in relation to the fentanyl and opioid crisis in the United States. In a recent hearing at the Senate Banking Committee, she cited a report from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, indicating that digital currencies, particularly bitcoin, are being used to fund the fentanyl trade in China.
