        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An anonymous Bitcoin donor has paid over $500,000 in BTC to cover WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's expenses for his flight home to Australia. Assange is now a free man after pleading guilty in a US court under a deal ending his 14-year legal battle.

JUST IN: #Bitcoin pioneer and freedom fighter Julian Assange has landed in Australia. He is officially a free man!
A win for free speech and freedom 👏 pic.twitter.com/lDyPabqa8u
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 26, 2024
  
  
  
Assange was released from prison in the UK on June 24th and flew to the US territory of Saipan to enter his plea. He had been fighting extradition to the US on espionage charges related to WikiLeaks publication of classified documents.
On June 26th, Assange arrived back in his native Australia and embraced family members in Canberra. He has been a pioneer for Bitcoin and WikiLeaks since its inception, even receiving donations in BTC in 2010 when few knew about it.
Just a day earlier, to cover the $520,000 cost of his private charter flight arranged by the Australian government, Assange's wife issued an urgent appeal for donations. She also provided a Bitcoin address for contributions.
Remarkably, a single Bitcoin donor sent over 8 BTC worth nearly $500,000 to the address to cover the entire debt. This allowed Assange to return home without financial burden.
The anonymous donor's massive contribution highlights the Bitcoin community's enduring support for Assange and his work revealing government secrets. Bitcoiners have long advocated for his release.
While the whale's identity remains unknown, the donation underscores Bitcoin's role in enabling uncensored free speech and financial freedom.
The weeks ahead will focus on helping Assange recuperate after prolonged confinement. However, given his longstanding history with the technology, his engagement with Bitcoin will likely continue. Assange's saga symbolized the battle between individual liberties and unchecked government power.]]></summary>
