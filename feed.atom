Ethereum Network Experiences Temporary Transaction Processing Issue
 
The Ethereum blockchain was unable to process ETH transactions and reach consensus for approximately 25 minutes on Thursday, just after 4 p.m. (ET). Ansgar Dietrichs, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation said: “The beacon chain had a brief period of non-finalization just now. Good illustration for the robustness of the chain — while there was some slowdown of blocks, transactions continued to be processed as usual. We are back to normal now.”

As Bitcoiners, we love the exhilarating feeling of bringing a new person into the Bitcoin lifeboat. Many of us constantly work to orange pill our friends, our coworkers and our neighbors, trying to save as many as we can before the fiat ship sinks. We'll even try to orange pill the waiter at our favorite local restaurant, helping them download a Lightning wallet and offering to give them a bigger tip to help them "get off zero."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell to a seven-week low on May 12, as prices dropped below the $27,000 level in today’s session. Friday’s decline came as a red wave swept through cryptocurrencies, with the market cap down 2.75% as of writing. Ethereum also slipped to its weakest point since March. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $27,000 level in today’s session, pushing prices to a seven-week low.
 
Following a high of $27,589.92 on Thursday, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday bottom at $26,166.87.
 
As a result of this drop, bitcoin fell to its lowest level since March 17, when price was below the $25,000 mark.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, this latest sell-off coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) breaking out of yesterday’s floor of 43.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 35.07, which is its lowest point in over two months.
 
Should momentum continue in this current trajectory, there is a possibility that BTC could move toward $25,000 this weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also in the red on Friday, as bears continued to control market sentiment.
 
ETH/USD slipped to a low at $1,742.40 on Thursday, following an earlier peak of $1,835.62 the day prior.
 
Similar to bitcoin, today’s drop in price saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency hit its lowest point since March.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
A major catalyst to the move was also a breakout on the RSI, which fell out of a support point at the 44.00 zone.
 
Currently, the index is at a reading of 39.04, which is its weakest level since March 11, when ETH traded below $1,500.
 
Ultimately, this could be a long-term positive for bulls, who may move to buy the current dip in price.
