        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was once again in the red on Friday, as Twitter finally removed the doge icon as its logo. The meme coin raced to a four-month high earlier in the week, after the social media giant unexpectedly added a cartoon image of doge on its website. Overall, crypto markets were mostly lower, with xrp a notable exception.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) fell for a fourth consecutive session on Friday, as Twitter finally removed the doge icon as its logo.
 
DOGE/USD surged to a high of $0.1048 on Tuesday, however as sentiment shifted, the meme coin fell to a low of $0.08185 earlier today.
 
Bears appear to be pushing doge towards a long-term floor at $0.0780, with prices down by nearly 9% today.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the latest drop in price coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) falling below support at 55.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at the 52.85 mark, with a lower floor at 50.00 a possible target for sellers.
 
Despite the recent downward trend, the 10-day (red) moving average continues to trend higher.
 
 
XRP
 
Despite the cryptocurrency market cap trading mostly lower on Friday, XRP, formerly ripple, was a notable exception.
 
Following a low of $0.4968 the day prior, XRP/USD moved to a peak at $0.5129 earlier today.
 
As a result of the move, bulls pushed the token away from a recent support point at the $0.4950 mark.
 
 
This comes as the RSI also moved away from a floor of its own at 59.00. It is currently tracking at 61.17.
 
Should this momentum continue into the Easter weekend, the next visible ceiling will be at the 65.00 mark.
 
If this point is reached, there is a good chance that XRP will be trading above $0.5200.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin has plunged around 8% over the past day as Elon Musk’s Twitter has dropped the Doge icon and has switched back to the original logo.
 
Dogecoin Has Observed A Sharp Plunge Over The Last 24 Hours
 
Just a few days ago, Twitter changed its icon to the Shiba Inu dog featured in the popular “Doge” meme. As Dogecoin is also based on the same meme, it was no surprise that the asset’s price made a sharp jump following this switch.
 
DOGE holders had been wondering whether this change was a temporary one or if it was there to stay. It seems that they may have got their answer today, as the social media platform has reversed the change and has gone back to the iconic logo, suggesting that the switch was a short-lived one after all.
 
At present, there hasn’t been any official communication…]]></summary>

In the last few years, NFTs have been the breakout application for Ethereum and other blockchains. While much of this mainstream user base did leave with the drop in NFT prices, many have stayed. But the initial surge in NFT interest drew most of these users to blockchain projects aside from Bitcoin, even though BTC is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap (which is twice the size of Ethereum’s) and it has the highest level of security and the most proven capacity as a store of value.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated for a third consecutive session on Friday, hours before a much anticipated nonfarm payrolls (NFP) release. Many are expecting that payrolls will come in under the 240,000 expected sum, following recent disappointing labor data. Ethereum was also largely unchanged as of writing.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated for a third consecutive session on Friday, as the global cryptocurrency market cap remains largely unchanged at the time of writing.
 
Following a high of $28,178.30 on Thursday, BTC/USD fell marginally lower in today’s session, hitting a bottom of $27,765.34.
 
Markets have mostly been muted following last week’s ten-month high, however a target of $30,000 still remains a short-term possibility.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 
 
 
 

 
From the chart, today’s action comes as the relative strength index (RSI) continues to hover close to a floor at 58.00
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 58.37, with the 10-day (red) moving average now on the brink of a downwards cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should today’s NFP beat expectations, resulting in a stronger U.S. Dollar, we could see this crossover take place, sending BTC lower.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was largely unchanged in today’s session, as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency remained near $1,850.
 
ETH/USD is trading at $1,854.27 at the time of writing, after falling to a low of $1,846.82 earlier in the day.
 
This comes just two days after ethereum rose to its strongest point since last August, climbing over $1,900 in the process.

The decline came as ETH bulls were unable to prevent the RSI from moving below a support point at 60.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking around 58.67, with a floor of 57.00 a potential target, should momentum begin to decline.
