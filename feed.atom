Bucharest, Romania,12/12/22, Chainwire:
 
After experiencing success in the crypto space, DeFi Yield Protocol announces a complete rebranding to Dypius. The experienced team conducted several months’ worth of research to come up with the best way to represent what they had evolved into over the years. Dypius has the suffix of the nebulae in the galaxy. Nebulas are the formations of gas, dust, and other materials that “clump” together to form denser regions in the universe. They attract further matter and eventually become dense enough to form stars, planets, and planetary system objects. Dypius is the place of creation of stars, planets, and life.

South Korean authorities continue their search and have already gone as far as invalidating Kwon’s passport but he continues to be elusive.

Do Kwon Is In Serbia?
 
The South Korean prosecutors have seemingly been following Do Kwon around the world. Previously, authorities had said that they believed that Kwon was in Dubai. However, they now believe that the Terra founder made his way to Serbia from Dubai last month.
