Bendigo’s announcement comes after similar moves by other major banks in the country, including National Australia Bank, Westpac, and Commonwealth Bank. According to the bank, this move aims to combat fraudulent transactions, including ones made with crypto.
 
 
Although there aren’t specific details as to what transactions or exchanges will be affected, it will undoubtedly affect how crypto users in the country perform crypto transactions and hinder fiat on-ramping to these exchanges. This undoubtedly causes a setback to the growing …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week trading higher, as markets prepared for a big week of economic data in the United States. The headline announcement will be Friday’s nonfarm payrolls, in addition to services and manufacturing activity data. Ethereum continued to trade above a key support point on Monday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was in the green to start the week, with the price trading at its highest point since last Friday.
 
Traders are optimistic heading into August, which has historically been a bullish month for the cryptocurrency.
 
BTC/USD hit an intraday high of $29,489.87, which comes following a low at $29,059.50 during Sunday’s session.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Bitcoin bulls rejected a breakout below the $29,000 mark, just as the relative strength index (RSI) closed in on a collision with a resistance level at 46.00.
 
This ceiling appears to be a major obstacle preventing price from moving towards its obvious target at the $30,000 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the RSI is tracking at 45.97 with bitcoin at $29,362.66.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) remained above a key support level at $1,850 on Monday, as traders continued to target the $1,900 level.
 
Following a low of $1,851.73 on Sunday, ETH/USD jumped to a peak of $1,884.14 earlier in the day.
 
The world’s second largest cryptocurrency has now gone ten days since it last traded above the $1,900 mark.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Like with BTC, in order for ETH to make further upward strides, it will first need to break out of a current ceiling on the RSI.
 
The index is currently tracking at 47.72, which is marginally below a key resistance level at the 48.00 mark.

One of Bitcoin’s many superpowers is that it takes on different aliases in various cultural environments. For many comparatively-wealthy North Americans, views on Bitcoin range from an annoying Thanksgiving dinner conversation topic to a technological breakthrough that may sever the state’s monopoly on money. At the same time, any American who is underrepresented and underserved by the legacy financial system is more likely to find that Bitcoin is a means of transferring value without having to have a bank account.
