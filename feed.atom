        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen its price going through a decline this week amidst wider corrections from most cryptocurrencies. The past seven days have been rough for SHIB hodlers, as the meme coin fell to as low as 0.00002584 earlier in the week, representing a price decline of over 15% from $0.00003069. However, it would seem the price decline has created an opportunity for some large investors, known as whales, to buy SHIB at a discount. 
 
 
According to on-chain data, some new SHIB whale accounts amassed 184 billion SHIB, worth approximately $4.9 million in the middle of the week from crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance.

Analysis of the crypto asset’s trend indicates that the price is on a downtrend which is currently trading below the 100-day Moving Average (MA) and the trend line. However, at the time of writing, Optimism was trading at around $2.9 and was up by about 1.22%.
