Solana ETF Proposals Deemed ‘Dead On Arrival’
 
According to Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas, the Solana ETF filings “never made it past Step 2” in the SEC’s review process, referring to the stage where the regulator posts the 19b-4 filings on its website. 
 
Balchunas stated that the lack of regulatory approval means the Solana ETF proposals have effectively been deemed “DOA” or “dead on arrival.” The exper…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Rebounded From Its Recent Lows
 
The “Mining Hashrate” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the computing power the Bitcoin miners have currently connected to the network. It’s measured in units of terahashes per second (TH/s).
 
 
When the metric’s value goes up, existing miners are adding to their facilities, and new miners are joining the network. Such a trend implies the miners are finding the network attractive.
 
On the other hand, a decline in the indicator suggests some miners have decided to disconnect from the blockchain, likely because they are no longer finding mining profitable.

The lawsuit was filed last Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, Seattle.
Laundering of Stolen Crypto
The three primary plaintiffs claim that their cryptocurrencies were stolen and subsequently deposited by the thieves on Binance to "remove the connection between the ledger and their digital assets," thereby making the stolen cryptocurrencies untraceable.
The lawsuit alleges that Binance was complicit in the money laundering process, which constitutes a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act.

Amid this sell-off, Ethereum wasn’t also spared. By August 5, the coin fell to as low as $2,100. Even though prices bounced on the days that followed these losses, the uptrend momentum has been shaky, and there are doubts that buyers will sustain the leg up.
