With bitcoin’s run-up above $25,000, MATIC saw tremendous gains that would see it rise above 21% in a seven-day period. As a result, the digital asset has been able to surpass Dogecoin (DOGE) by market cap, and the next target looks to be Cardano (ADA).
 
Polygon Flips Dogecoin, Looks To Cardano
 
The advent of the ZK Sync narrative has played in the favor of Polygon so far as the digital asset rallied to new one-year highs. Since then, Polygon has been on a winning streak which eventually saw its market cap rise above that of Dogecoin. With this, MATIC is now the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana rose by as much as 11% to start the week, as the token moved higher for a fourth consecutive session. Market sentiment has mostly been bullish in the past two weeks, leading to prices hitting a multi-month high on Monday. Bitcoin cash also surged, climbing to its strongest level since July.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rose by over 11% in Monday’s session, as the token raced to a multi-month high earlier in the day.
 
Following a low of $24.04 on Sunday, SOL/USD surged to an intraday peak of $26.93 to start the week.
 
As a result of this move, solana climbed to its highest level since November 8, when price hit a high of $31.78.
 
 
This is the fourth straight session that solana has risen, with prices breaking out of a key resistance level of $26.00 in the process.
 
In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has moved beyond a ceiling of its own at 62.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 63.58, and should it continue in this upward direction, SOL could hit $30.00 in the coming days.
 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Another notable gainer on Monday has been bitcoin cash (BCH), which also moved to its highest point in the past several months..
 
BCH/USD raced to a high of $146.83 earlier in the day, which comes after trading at a bottom of $134.55 on Sunday.
 
The rally took bitcoin cash to a point not seen since July 31, when the cryptocurrency traded above $150.00.
 
 
This comes as the 10-day (red) moving average nears a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Additionally, the RSI has also moved to a 16-day high, and is tracking at 65.85, which is near a ceiling of 66.00.
 
Should price strength pass this hurdle, then BCH bulls will likely recapture the $150.00 mark.

This is an opinion editorial by Jimmy Song, a Bitcoin developer, educator and entrepreneur and programmer with over 20 years of experience.
In the last essay, I covered how fiat money ruins individual incentives. The lack of savings vehicles and the availability of debt create a potent mix of terrible incentives at the individual level. Lack of savings vehicles mean that individuals have to work to keep any value they have and the availability of debt means that they can bring forward a lot of consumption.
The result is a lot of people who consume and relatively few productive people who save.
Why Companies?
