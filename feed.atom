Shiba Inu Has Plunged More Than 12% In The Past Week
 
While Bitcoin investors have enjoyed the year 2024 so far because of the asset’s break beyond the $45,000 barrier, holders of the altcoins have been less fortunate.

As is visible in the graph, Shiba Inu had crashed alongside the rest of the market a few days back, but while BTC recovered, SHIB has only slipped further down.
 
 
During the past day, the memecoin had plummeted to as low as $0.00000850, but since then, the coin has rebounded towards $0.00…]]></summary>

Taking to X on January 7, Malekan noted the habit of projects allowing insiders with locked tokens to stake and earn rewards. Though the professor acknowledges that more staking can enhance network security, allowing “insiders” to stake and earn rewards on their locked tokens is “unfair” because retail token holders must pay full price for the assets.
