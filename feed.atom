        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is stepping up its efforts to regulate the burgeoning cryptocurrency market with two key initiatives: establishing criteria for classifying these asset types as financial instruments and setting stricter rules for non-EU companies operating in the bloc.
 
 
These moves come in response to the rapidly growing European crypto market, projected to reach $19 billion by 2028, and increasing calls for regulatory clarity. The landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations passed by the European Parliament last August laid the groundwork, and ESMA is now filling in the crucial details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, Transak, a company specializing in payment infrastructure, revealed its partnership with the financial services powerhouse Visa. This collaboration aims to empower users in 145 nations with the capability to seamlessly exchange their crypto holdings into local fiat currencies, leveraging the Visa Direct platform.
 
Enhanced Crypto Liquidity: Transak’s Alliance with Visa Facilitates Swift Global Transfers
 
Transak, a provider of payment infrastructure for cryptocurrency assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has entered into a partnership with the leading payment company Visa. This collaboration facilitates instant withdrawals of crypto funds to debit cards in 145 countries, as highlighted by Transak’s announcement.
 
“By enabling real-time card withdrawals through Visa Direct, Transak is delivering a faster, simpler and more connected experience for its users — making it easier to convert crypto balances into fiat, which can be spent at the more than 130M merchant locations where Visa is accepted,” the North America head of Visa Direct and Global Ecosystem Readiness, Yanilsa Gonzalez-Ore said.
 
The press announcement sent to Bitcoin.com News highlights that a key attribute of Visa Direct is its capability for immediate transaction processing. This translates to the possibility of money transfers being completed in nearly 30 minutes or less, marking a notable improvement compared to conventional banking practices, which often require several days.
 
 
“Combining this with Transak’s robust infrastructure and support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, the collaboration welcomes a new dawn for those who want to quickly exit the crypto market,” the company emphasized. The partnership follows Visa’s announcement earlier this month that it will include Web3 elements in its customized loyalty program solution.

As pointed out by an analyst, Ali, in a post on X, the DOGE network has seen some impressive growth in addresses recently. The relevant on-chain indicator here is “Daily New Addresses,” which keeps track of the total amount of addresses coming online for the first time on the Dogecoin blockchain every day.
 
There are a couple of reasons why new addresses would be created on the blockchain. The first and the more major factor is natural adoption, as fresh investors coming into the asset would create new addresses for themselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recently disappeared GBTC discount may be “a sign of industry maturing and the improved enterprise acceptance of bitcoin.” While some see the disappearance of the discount as pointing to the re-emergence of the premium to the net asset value (NAV), one expert said he sees “the continued parity or even a resurgence of the discount” as real possibilities.
 
The Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals
 
On or around January 26, the discount to the net asset value (NAV) of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) narrowed to zero for the first time in nearly three years. Since descending to 44% in June 2023, the discount has gradually shrunk and by Dec. 20, 2023, it had reached the single-digit figure of 7%.

This is not on any level what Anarchy means. It is simply a system lacking rulers or a central authority, where all cooperation and coordination is done on a purely voluntary basis between peers in the system. The etymology of the original Greek word, anarhkia, itself literally just means “without rulers.” An, meaning without, arkhia, meaning rulers. 
This concept is the foundational reality of why Bitcoin functions as a distributed network and protocol. There is literally no one in charge of the network. If there were, then it would not be a distributed system composed of sovereign individuals voluntarily choosing to interact with each other.

crypto and NFTs, has partnered with Visa. This collaboration  
aims to empower users globally, enabling them to convert their  
cryptocurrency holdings into local fiat currencies.
Transak's presence across 350+ leading Web3 wallets  
and platforms ensures widespread accessibility for users worldwide. From  
MetaMask to Coinbase Wallet, Transak's integration aims to simplify the  
conversion process, bringing crypto-to-fiat capabilities to the fingertips of  
millions.
Targeting Swift Crypto-to-Fiat Conversions
Sami Start, the Co-founder and CEO of Transak,  
mentioned in a statement shared with Finance Magnates on Telegram: "We believe this partnership is an inflection point for Web3 as  
a whole. Now, millions across the globe have a straightforward way to cash out  
their digital asset holdings to their local currency intuitively and in real-time. They no longer have to walk the treacherous path of compliance  
uncertainty or face risks of fraud."
Visa Direct's hallmark feature is its ability to  
process transactions swiftly, often within 30 minutes. This stands in stark  
contrast to traditional banking methods, which can entail lengthy delays,  
especially across borders.

Notably, the figure alone was enough to overshadow the outflows recorded by Grayscale’s GBTC.

Fidelity Records $208 Million Of Inflows
 
BitMEX Research revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Fidelity’s FBTC saw an inflow of $208 million on January 29. This figure more than offsets the $192 million in outflows recorded by Grayscale’s GBTC. Before now, GBTC’s outflows had been the major talking point and how they were negatively impacting BTC’s price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest data from Grayscale’s GBTC reveals that the trust’s bitcoin holdings have diminished to below 500,000, following a departure of 6,138.79 bitcoin from its reserves in the past day. Conversely, Blackrock’s IBIT has bolstered its bitcoin assets by 4,603.24 bitcoin, valued at $199 million.
 
GBTC’s Bitcoin Holdings Wane as Competing Funds Increase Their Caches
 

 
On Jan. 30, 2024, Grayscale’s GBTC’s bitcoin portfolio stood at 496,573.81 BTC, with an estimated market value of $21.43 billion. GBTC has experienced a significant depletion in its bitcoin reserve, with a decrease of approximately 120,506.18 BTC, equivalent to around $5.23 billion in value, since Jan. 12. On Jan. 29, the combined trade volume for all ten spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reached $1.59 billion, with GBTC contributing $576.01 million to this figure.
 

 
While GBTC experienced a decrease, Blackrock’s IBIT witnessed growth in the past day, escalating from 52,025.76 BTC to a current tally of 56,629.00 BTC, as per the latest IBIT figures. Fidelity’s most recent update for their holdings on Jan. 30 remains pending, and as of Jan. 29, FBTC’s holdings were at 46,238.09 BTC. However, onchain data indicates an increase to 47,238 BTC. ARKB, managed by Ark Invest and 21shares, now possesses 14,790 BTC. Bitwise’s BITB maintains a reserve of 13,576.10 BTC, having observed no growth in the last day.
 

 

 

 
The rest of the ETFs have yet to refresh their holding reports. Currently, Invesco has 6,833 BTC, Vaneck possesses 2,885.46 BTC, Valkyrie owns 2,635.29 BTC, and Franklin Templeton’s holdings are at 1,363 BTC. Holding the smallest bitcoin amount among the spot bitcoin ETFs is Wisdomtree, with 201 BTC valued at $8.7 million. All nine spot BTC ETFs hold 140,250.85 BTC as of Jan. 30, 2024.
