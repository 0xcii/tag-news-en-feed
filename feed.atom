Coinbase Spot Trading Volume Dropped by Half
 
According to the report, the cryptocurrency platform’s spot trading volume fell by more than half during the recently completed third quarter of 2023.
 
 
Data from researcher CCData showed that the platform recorded about $76 billion in spot trading volume in the Q3 of 2023, which represents a 52% drop in its spot trading volume of $158 billion from the Q3 of the previous year.
 
The figure is likely the least the platform has seen in its spot trading volume since 2020, before it was listed on the Nasdaq Sto…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin did not appear out of nothing. For decades prior to Satoshi Nakamoto introducing his invention, a diverse group of computer scientists, privacy activists, and heterodox economists tried to create a digital form of money that could operate independently of government control. The Genesis Book tells the story of the people and projects that inspired the invention of the world's first successful peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” 
-Cover Sypnosis

Aaron van Wirdum’s long awaited book goes through the pre-history of everything that led up to the creation of Bitcoin. So many individual ideas and concepts went into the creation of Bitcoin that people tend to forget the history of those pieces before Satoshi glued them together into the Bitcoin protocol we know today. 
The Genesis Book gives the readers a long walk through the history of both the people and cultural movements spawned out of the early rise of the hacker community, and how these cultural movements and their respective ethoses shaped the technologies themselves that were produced. The ethos and mentality of the members of early counter-culture groups like the cypherpunks and extropians laid the ideological foundation of the cultures we see thriving in Bitcoin today. 
These same people also laid the technical foundations Bitcoin itself was built upon, through early attempts at digital cash systems like David Chaum’s ecash, to Wei Dai’s b-money. Concepts like Adam Back’s Hashcash and Hal Finney’s Reusable Proof of Work (RPOW) also began the slow road towards Bitcoin’s proof of work consensus system. 
For anyone who wants to truly understand the pre-history of Bitcoin, and the people and technological inventions that laid the groundwork for Satoshi’s gift to us, this book is a must read. 

The book is available for pre-order here, with shipments expected to go out starting on January 3rd, 2024.]]></summary>

As pointed out by analyst James V. Straten in a post on X, inflows have recently occurred on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The relevant indicator here is the “exchange netflow volume,” which keeps track of the net amount of Bitcoin entering into or exiting the wallets of a given centralized exchange.
 
When the value of this metric is negative, it means that the exchange is seeing outflows of a net number of coins right now.

As the 4th Halving nears and the block reward trims to 3.125 bitcoin per block, miners must not only adapt to a significantly diminished reward, but contend with an increasingly profit-hostile future which might have surprised even the prescient Nakamoto. Indeed, despite widespread hope that fiat states will come to accept peaceful coexistence with bitcoin—I, too, would prefer this outcome—and despite some modest grounds for optimism, history would remind us that kings and emperors do not willingly relinquish power.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was a notable mover on Friday, as the meme coin rebounded from a key support point. The move came after two consecutive days of declines, pushing price near a two-month low. Solana also ended a losing streak in today’s session. 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) rose higher in today’s session, after the meme coin snapped a recent losing streak.
 
DOGE/USD climbed to a peak of $0.05873 earlier in the day, after falling to a low at $0.05747 the day prior.
 
The move comes after dogecoin dropped close to a floor at $0.0580, with bulls choosing to reject this breakout.
 
 
Since hitting this support level, it now seems that the next target could be at resistance of $0.0595.
 
On closer inspection of the chart, it appears that the relative strength index (RSI) also rebounded from a floor of its own at 31.00.
 
The index is now at a reading of 33.20, with the next level traders might target at 35.00, which seems to be an interim ceiling.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) also climbed higher on Friday, after falling to a two-week low during Thursday’s session.
 
Following a drop to a low of $21.07 yesterday, SOL/USD rallied to an intraday peak at $21.59 earlier today.
 
Similar to dogecoin, bulls bought the dip, after the token neared a support level of its own at the $21.00 mark.
 
 
Earlier gains have somewhat eased, which comes as price strength hovers around a floor of 50.00.
 
Should this level hold firm, there is a good chance that traders look to take solana back above $22.00 this weekend.
