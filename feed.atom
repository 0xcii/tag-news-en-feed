A Deliberate Move or Forced?
“At the moment, we are faced with the need to suspend special balance withdrawals and technical support. This is a temporary measure to prepare for and go through the upcoming court hearings regarding the seizure of user assets in France. We are determined and optimistic about this issue,” the team behind Bitzlato wrote on Telegram.

Amidst this chaos, crypto assets such as bitcoin demonstrated remarkable resilience, even capitalizing on the banking sector’s misfortunes. Concurrently, other repercussions unfolded, including the de-pegging of the second-largest stablecoin, managed by Circle, following the disclosure of difficulties in retrieving $3.3 billion from the now-insolvent Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).
