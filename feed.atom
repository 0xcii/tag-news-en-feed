Called Jurat, the protocol enables capabilities like freezing disputed coins or recovering stolen coins after a hack, all under the auspices of the justice system.

How Ethereum Is A Scam
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bit Paine gave his view on Ethereum and other altcoins in what he termed “a brief history of the rise and fall of ethereum.” He seemed to be alluding to the Ethereum network when he spoke about a “world computer,” which he labeled a scam.
 
 
According to him, this world computer only succeeded, despite being a scam, because of “one very potent use case,” which is that it provided a platform for anyone to easily create and sell “digital penny stock” (which he also referred to as unregistered s…]]></summary>

This discussion came in response to fellow pro-XRP attorney John E. Deaton’s comment: “The people who’ve argued that the SEC got a 50-50 victory in the Ripple case are 100% wrong. It was more like 90-10 in Ripple’s favor. If Ripple ends up paying $20M or less it’s a 99.9% legal victory.”
