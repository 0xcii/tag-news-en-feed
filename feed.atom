Class certification is a court order that gives plaintiffs the right to proceed on behalf of a particular class of plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit. If the judge already denies that order, the case, which has been ongoing since 2018, could end sooner than expected.
 
XRP community attorney John E. Deaton stated in a Twitter thread today that it is a Zoom hearing that he will be attending. Unlike the case of LBRY vs. the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the judge in charge of the case will not allow amicus attorneys to attend the oral…]]></summary>

This technological wonder, with a current market value of $540 billion, ingeniously integrates encryption and mathematical formulas to fortify its security. In this exploration, we delve into two of the mathematical choices that underpin Bitcoin’s complex architecture, determining block rewards, transaction inputs and outputs, and mining difficulty adjustments, while also regulating the pace at which new blocks are discovered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
