Binance Has Recently Received Large Bitcoin Deposits
 
As pointed out by analyst James V. Straten in a post on X, inflows have recently occurred on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The relevant indicator here is the “exchange netflow volume,” which keeps track of the net amount of Bitcoin entering into or exiting the wallets of a given centralized exchange.
 
When the value of this metric is negative, it means that the exchange is seeing outflows of a net number of coins right now. As investors generally withdraw their coins from platforms like these to hold onto them for extended periods in self-custodial wallets, this kind of trend can be bullish fo…]]></summary>

Tension is building in the mines. As the 4th Halving nears and the block reward trims to 3.125 bitcoin per block, miners must not only adapt to a significantly diminished reward, but contend with an increasingly profit-hostile future which might have surprised even the prescient Nakamoto. Indeed, despite widespread hope that fiat states will come to accept peaceful coexistence with bitcoin—I, too, would prefer this outcome—and despite some modest grounds for optimism, history would remind us that kings and emperors do not willingly relinquish power. This is no less true of modern fiat empires, as Lyn Alden’s survey of U.S. fiat interventionism explains.1 History, coupled with ongoing observation of federal actions—foreign and domestic—will be sufficient to ca…]]></summary>

The largest bitcoin (BTC) trust known as GBTC has seen a significant improvement in terms of its previous discount to NAV. Essentially, net asset value (NAV) serves as a financial barometer, indicating the per-share value of a fund’s underlying assets. In the context of GBTC, the NAV represents the value of BTC it holds, adjusted for liabilities, and divided by its outstanding shares. Simply put, it’s a measure of what e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was a notable mover on Friday, as the meme coin rebounded from a key support point. The move came after two consecutive days of declines, pushing price near a two-month low. Solana also ended a losing streak in today’s session. 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) rose higher in today’s session, after the meme coin snapped a recent losing streak.
 
DOGE/USD climbed to a peak of $0.05873 earlier in the day, after falling to a low at $0.05747 the day prior.
 
The move comes after dogecoin dropped close to a floor at $0.0580, with bulls choosing to reject this breakout.
 
 
Since hitting this support level, it now seems that the next target could be at resistance of $0.0595.
 
On closer inspection of the chart, it appears that the relative strength index (RSI) also rebounded from a floor of its own at 31.00.
 
The index is now at a reading of 33.20, with the next level traders might target at 35.00, which seems to be an interim ceiling.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) also climbed higher on Friday, after falling to a two-week low during Thursday’s session.
 
Following a drop to a low of $21.07 yesterday, SOL/USD rallied to an intraday peak at $21.59 earlier today.
 
Similar to dogecoin, bulls bought the dip, after the token neared a support level of its own at the $21.00 mark.
 
 
Earlier gains have somewhat eased, which comes as price strength hovers around a floor of 50.00.
 
Should this level hold firm, there is a good chance that traders look to take solana back above $22.00 this weekend.
