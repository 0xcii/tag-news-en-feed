In fact, during the early days of December, the company admitted it is crossing its fingers to avoid filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy by engaging in what it termed as advanced negotiations.
 
On the other end of the negotiating table is an unnamed party Argo Blockchain hopes will support its business as it is dealing with insufficient funding to continue its operations.
 
At that time, among those being considered by the company to make ends meet were selling some of its assets and securing equipment financing to buff its thinning balance sheet and improve its liquidity.
