        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capula Management, Europe's fourth-largest investment manager, has disclosed holdings of nearly $500 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs, as per an SEC filing today. 

JUST IN: Capula Management, Europe's fourth largest investment manager, discloses it owns $500 million in spot #Bitcoin ETFs 🇪🇺 pic.twitter.com/AarPOFjrbt
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 5, 2024
  
  
  
The firm reported owning $211 million in Fidelity's spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) and $253 million in BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), totaling $464 million. Capula's significant investment in Bitcoin ETFs reflects a further growing acceptance of Bitcoin among traditional financial institutions.
This investment aligns with a broader trend of institutional adoption, as more firms seek exposure to the potential upside of BTC. The SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has made it easier for institutions to invest in Bitcoin, providing a more accessible and regulated vehicle for participation in this burgeoning market.
And despite Bitcoin's recent plunge from $67,500 to $49,000, large institutions continue to show confidence in Bitcoin. Data from Arkham indicates that major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and MicroStrategy are not selling their Bitcoin holdings, and are likely buying more.

This latest development, according to a report by Reuters, is a demonstration of the popularity of digital currencies and the opportunity these businesses have to use their vast payment networks to advance the e-rupee’s adoption.
 
Beginning in December 2022, the e-rupee trial became exclusive to banks. But the RBI recently broadened the eligibility to include payment companies, so that services like PhonePe, Google Pay, and Amazon Pay may take part.

Dogecoin has suffered this significant price crash thanks to its strong positive price correlation with Bitcoin.
