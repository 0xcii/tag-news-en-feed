After three years of struggles with COVID-19, the city is vibrant and flourishing again as business executives and tourists of all kinds pour back into Asia's financial center. New guidelines from the Securities and Futures Commission are paving the way. 
Since Hong Kong FinTech Week last year regulators have been building a comprehensive license regime for digital assets. Regulated under the principle of “same business, same risks, same rules,” digital assets are now being approached with similar rules to traditional financial ones. This has resulted in breakthrough moments for the industry this year such as when Hong Kong's licensed exchange HashKey launched a digital asset exchange App, and various traditional financial institutions receive…]]></summary>

There are some indications that his post could be alluding to a potential partnership on the horizon. 
 
What Kusama’s Cryptic Post Could Mean
 
Kusama’s post, which only contained a ‘handshake’ emoji, could suggest that Shiba Inu (SHIB) or the Shibarium network is working on or has sealed a significant partnership. The partnership speculation is fuelled by the fact that Kusama had reposted an X post by Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lucie before he also made his cryptic post. 
 
 
In Lucie’s post, she alluded to the connection between SHIB and Shibarium. Notably, there was a ‘chain’ emoji close to the word “SHIB,” which could be an allusi…]]></summary>

One of the oddest and most mysterious relationships that emerged out of the collapse of FTX last year was Alameda Research’s unusual relationship with Farmington State Bank, one of the smallest, rural banks in the United States that came under the control of Jean Chalopin in 2020. Chalopin is best known as the chairman of Deltec, one of the main banks for Alameda Research – FTX’s trading arm that played a central role in its collapse — and still one of the main banks for the largest fiat-backed stablecoin, Tether (USDT).

Bitcoin
 
The past day saw bitcoin’s price range fluctuate between $41,804 and $45,813 with a market capitalization of $832 billion and trading volume of around $35.96 billion. The oscillators and moving averages hint at a diverging sentiment: while the momentum and moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) level indicate bearish action, there’s a strong bullish signal from the exponential and simple moving averages, especially over longer periods (50, 100, and 200 days).
