        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The markets are always buzzing with predictions, and the latest one is turning heads. Dogecoin price, a fan favourite, is expected to rally to $1 before December. Shiba Inu (SHIB), however, could shoot up to $0.0005. But perhaps the most shocking of them all is ETFSwap (ETFS), an Ethereum token, which could rise from $0.03846 To $35. 
 
ETFSwap (ETFS) Shows Promising Signs Of Long-term Prospects And Sustainability 
The core feature of ETFSwap (ETFS) lies in its ability to tokenize Spot ETFs. By tokenizing real-world assets, including gold, oil, and corn, ETFSwap (ETFS) taps into the massive ETF market and serves as a bridge linking both traditional ETFs and cryptocurrency-focused ETFs.

Why The Dogecoin Price Rallied By Over 7%
 
The Dogecoin price rallied by over 7% following Musk’s tweet, in which he alluded to ‘D.O.G.E.’ Musk simply said in his post, “D.O.G.E will fix it,” in response to another post asserting that politicians and bureaucrats are the greatest threat to human progress and flourishing. 
 
 
The acronym stands for the ‘Department of Government Efficiency,’ a position that Musk could occupy under a Donald Trump administration. The former US President has said that if elected, he wants to use Musk’s expertise to curb exce…]]></summary>

Hayes believes more borrowing will ensue with increasing military spending and that this borrowing will be serviced by more balance sheet expansion by the Federal Reserve and commercial banks, all ultimately to the detriment of the US dollar.
 
Hayes is quick to note that in times when traditional fiat currencies are weakening, Bitcoin stands to gain because it acts as a hedge against inflation. The recent increase of the US Producer …]]></summary>
