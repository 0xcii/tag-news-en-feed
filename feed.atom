        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano fell to a fresh all-time low on Saturday, as prices plunged by over 10% to start the weekend. The move saw the token drop for a third straight session, as a red wave swept through cryptocurrency markets. Binance coin also moved lower, dropping for a seventh consecutive day.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) moved to a fresh all-time low to start the weekend, as prices dropped for a third straight session.
 
Following a high of $0.3011 on Friday, ADA/USD moved to a low of $0.2603 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw the token plunge by nearly 13% earlier in the day, hitting a new all-time low in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the drop comes as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
This signals a shift in price momentum, and comes as the relative strength index (RSI) fell deeper into oversold territory.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 24.13, which is its weakest point since October 21.
 
 
Binance Coin (BNB)
 
Binance coin (BNB) was another notable token to fall today, with prices dropping for a seventh straight session.
 
Recent declines have come as financial firm Mazars halted its audit of Binance’s reserves.
 
As a result of this, BNB/USD fell to a low of $221.00, which comes a day after hitting a high of $264.25.
 
 
Overall, the token is now down by nearly 20% in the last week, and is down 10.88% as of writing.
 
Similar to cardano, the RSI on BNB is currently trading near the 24.00 mark, which is deep in oversold territory.
 
BNB is currently trading at its lowest point since July 13.

In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple and its current and former chief executives. The regulator alleged that they carried out $1.3 billion in sales of unregistered securities since the launch of Ripple’s native token, XRP.
 
 
Since then, the lawsuit has been deliberated upon in different dimensions, with several issues popping out once in a while.
 
Currently, the case is moving toward the Summary Judgement announcement even as the amicus curiae files a new request.
 
An amicus curiae, sometimes known as a “friend of the court,” is an individual or organization that is not a party to a legal dispute but is permitted to assist the court by providing relevant information, expertise, or insight.

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) extended recent declines on Saturday, as markets continued to be nervous following recent uncertainty surrounding Binance’s proof-of-reserves audit.
 
The auditor in charge of the diligence, Mazars, opted to pause all of its work with crypto clients earlier this week, leading to a resurgence of bearish sentiment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The BIS’ Basel Committee introduced a finalized proposal for limits to the amount of Tier 1 capital banks can hold in bitcoin.
The Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has finalized a proposed policy that would place a 2% limit on banks' Tier 1 capital held in bitcoin. This comes with an endorsement from the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the oversight body of the Basel Committee, which is the “primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks.”
Investopedia defines Tier 1 capital as “the core capital held in a bank's reserves [that] is used to fund business activities for the bank's clients. It includes common stock, as well as disclosed reserves and certain other assets.” 
The policy includes bitcoin in its definition of Group 2 crypto assets, saying that “In addition to any tokenised traditional assets and stablecoins that fail the classification conditions, Group 2 includes all unbacked cryptoassets.” It later describes that “a bank’s total exposure to Group 2 cryptoassets should not generally be higher than 1% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital and must not exceed 2% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital.”

The BIS had previously considered a policy of 1% for global banks. In turn, the banks requested a 5% reserve limit. This 2% appears to be a compromise between the two. According to data from 2020, if applied to all banks in the world, who collectively custody approximately $180 trillion, this would amount to a limit of $3.6 trillion in bitcoin held by such entities. 
Tiff Macklem, Chair of the GHOS, stated that “Today's endorsement by the GHOS marks an important milestone in developing a global regulatory baseline for mitigating risks to banks from cryptoassets. It is important to continue to monitor bank-related developments in cryptoasset markets. We remain ready to act further if necessary.”]]></summary>
