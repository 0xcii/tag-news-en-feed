While the network has been slipping away from the top 10, it remains one of the most decentralized platforms. Pooltool data shows that Cardano has over 2,800 stake pools (or validators) when writing on October 16. 
 
 
To maintain this level of decentralization, stake pool operators must run nodes and maintain a high uptime, over 99%, to avoid penalties. This is often achieved using centralized cloud service providers like Google, Amazon, and others.

According to a report by the Irish Examiner, Ireland’s Finance Minister, Jack Chambers, has already asked the cabinet to draft this urgent law, as the country needs to update its regulations before the European bloc's deadline.
EU Moves Ahead with Crypto Laws
The 27-country European bloc’s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Act covers crypto transactions. However, it differs from the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which partially came into effect earlier this year, with its remaining provisions set to be enforced by the end of 2024.

Dogecoin Has Seen A Jump Of Almost 12% Over The Past Day

Making false tokens that look like real wallet tokens is one typical phishing method used to pilfer cryptocurrencies from victims’ wallets. Particularly harmful is permit phishing since it lets several highly valuable tokens be transferred simultaneously.
