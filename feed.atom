In a recent strategy session, Nicholas Merten, the popular host of DataDash, cautioned that cryptocurrencies and FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) could experience lackluster gains over the next few years.
 
Merten’s prognosis encompasses not only digital currencies like Bitcoin but also the broader altcoin space, which has historically seen exponential growth. He attributes this potential underperformance to several factors, with one key element being the contraction of market liquidity.
 
 
Contracting market liquidity refers to a reduction in the availability of assets for trading within a market. In th…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-08T10:42:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A court in Turkey has sentenced Faruk Fatih Özer, the founder of the collapsed Turkish crypto exchange Thodex, his sister Serap Özer, and his brother Güven Özer to 11,196 years, ten months and 15 days in prison, according to Coindesk. Further, they are also facing a judicial penalty of 135 million liras (about $5 million).  

Thodex CEO Goes to Jail
It was part of an extensive trial of 21 defendants facing up to 40,564 years in prison. On its verdict on Thursday, the Anatolian 9th Heavy Penal Court acquitted 16 defendants and released another four due to lack of evidence. The rest faced varying sentencing depending on the charges against them.  

Thodex was the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Turkey. The exchange suddenly went offline in April 2021. Özer immediately went missing, but the authorities arrested his brother, sister, and four other senior employees and also detailed at least 83 other people.  

The exchange had around 400,000 clients when it shuttered, out of which 390,000 were actively trading cryptocurrencies. Before going offline, the exchange was handling crypto trading volumes of more than $585 million, according to CoinMarketCap.com data. It was estimated to be holding cryptocurrency deposits of about $2 billion.   

Serious Charges against Thodex CEO  

Özer was later arrested in Albania in August 2022 after an Interpol red notice was issued against him. He was extradited to Turkey last April for seven charges, including creating and running a criminal organization, being part of a criminal organization, cheating by using information systems as a tool of banks or credit institutions, deceiving merchants or company executives and cooperative managers, and hiding the value of assets that come from crime.  

He was also sentenced to seven months and 15 days in prison in July for failing to submit certain documents demanded by the Turkish Tax Inspection Board, Finance Magnates earlier reported.

the cryptocurrency world where quick profits are tempting, scams like the  
XIRTAM rug pull have left investors vulnerable. However, Binance, a leading

Binance's Role in Detecting Suspicious Activity
In  
early May 2023, a project called 'XIRTAM' was used to steal a significant amount  
of funds from its investors. Following the theft, XIRTAM was a process to attempt to deposit  
approximately 1,909 Ether (ETH) into a Binance.com account. Binance detected  
the suspicious activity and promptly froze the account and the deposited funds,  
preventing  the XIRTAM team from accessing the funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ugandan mobility fintech Asaak recently spread its tentacles to Latin America after it bought the Mexican asset financing business Flexclub. The fintech’s CEO suggested that his company’s successful and profitable microfinance business partly influenced the decision to acquire the Mexican startup.
 
Asaak’s Profitable Business
 
The Ugandan mobility fintech Asaak recently said it acquired car financing startup Flexclub Mexico for an undisclosed sum. According to one report, Asaak’s acquisition of the Mexican asset financing startup will potentially expose the Uganda-based startup firm to the Mexican microfinance market and the South African car rental market. Flexclub has reportedly pivoted away from the Mexican market.
 
Kaivan Sattar, the co-founder and CEO of the Ugandan fintech, suggested that his company’s successful and profitable microfinance business had partly influenced the decision to acquire the Mexican startup.
 

 
As explained in a Techcabal report, Asaak’s decision to acquire Flexclub Mexico might have been influenced by the fact that the same investor funds both startups.
 
“As active investors in both Asaak and FlexClub, simple.Capital() spotted an opportunity to procure the acquisition of FlexClub’s Mexican business by Asaak. We congratulate both management teams on the closing of this transaction which we believe has significant benefits for both Asaak and FlexClub,” Blake Musgrove, partner and Chief Investment Officer at Simple.capital, reportedly said.
 
Meanwhile, Tinashe Ruzane, the CEO and co-founder of Flexclub, said a decision to exit the Mexican market has enabled the startup to focus its efforts on the South African market.
