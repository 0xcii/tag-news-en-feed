The “mining hashrate” refers to a metric that keeps track of the total computing power the miners have currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
When this metric goes up, the existing miners will expand their facilities, and new ones will join the network. Such a trend implies that these chain validators are finding the blockchain attractive to mine right now.
 
 
On the other hand, a decline in the indicator suggests some miners are disconnecting their rigs from Bitcoin, potentially because they are finding the coin unprofitable.

Cardano Key Demand Zone
 
In the chart shared by Ali, he points out that the key demand zone is between $0.37 and $0.38 mainly because of the widespread accumulation that took place in this region. A total of 166,470 wallets had purchased around 4.88 billion ADA at these price levels, making it their entry price.
