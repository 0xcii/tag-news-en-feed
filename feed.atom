        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In addition to the Bitcoin crash that has brought down the crypto market, Shibarium, an Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by the Shiba Inu team, has taken a huge hit. This latest drawback comes in the form of a significant decline in the number of daily transactions being carried out on the network, leading to its lowest level in months.
 
Shibarium Daily Transactions Fall Below 10,000
 
From the end of 2023 and into the new year of 2024, the Shibarium network had been seeing a lot of adoption. This was embodied by a significant rise in the number of daily transactions that were being carried out on the network. It rose rapidly and crossed more than 7 million daily transactions in December 2023. And even after usage began to wane in the new year, the Ethereum Layer 2 network was still abl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) recently achieved a significant milestone by reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 on March 14th. This surge was primarily attributed to the booming Bitcoin ETF market, which substantially impacted the cryptocurrency’s price. 
 
However, following this new ATH, BTC has experienced a significant price correction, hitting a low of $60,900 on Tuesday, March 19th. The main factors contributing to this downturn are the increased selling activity of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and a decline in demand for the new investment vehicles approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10th.

The rationale is understandable: if criminals won’t be able to use their money, they will have to eventually stop whatever they are doing and go get a 9 to 5 job.
However, after 20 years of ever tighter (and ever more expensive) AML regulations, the levels of organized crime, tax evasion, or drug use do not show any signs of decrease. At the same time, the basic right to privacy is being unceremoniously violated on an everyday basis, with each financial operation, no matter how tiny, being subject to extensive verifications and tons of paperwork.
