Binance Asked to Provide More Information
 
The collapse of the crypto exchange FTX prompted Dubai regulators to ask for more information from crypto license applicants such as Binance, a Bloomberg report has said. According to the April 5 report, officials from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) have in recent weeks told Binance, which already holds the minimal viable product license, to share more information concerning its ownership structure, governance, and …]]></summary>

Foundry, the Bitcoin mining arm of Digital Currency Group, will stop providing its services for free, according to a notice distributed to clients as reported by Bloomberg. 
The company has been offering its mining pool services free of charge since 2019 which contributed to its significant growth, now holding the largest share of estimated hash rate at more than 30%. 
The notice states that the mining pool fees will be tiered based on the previous quarter’s average hashrate. The change is expected to take effect between April 19 and April 22.
Recently DCG's crypto lending unit, Genesis, filed for bankruptcy as one of the final dominos ensuing from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.
Bitcoin mining companies faced a rocky 2022, with many on “fighting for survival,” as Bitcoin Magazine PRO analysts put it. But despite necessary moves like public miner giant Marathon Digital selling bitcoin for the first time in company history, good news has come out of the industry as 2023 takes off, such as the announcement of Terawulf’s nuclear facility operation, the expected 50MW CleanSpark expansion, and more.
This move by Foundry may be a bolstering effort designed to better mitigate the impacts of seasons like that of late 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Buncombe County's plan to halt bitcoin mining for a year would be the latest setback for an industry facing regulatory pressures.
 
         
         
         
         
    
Buncombe County commissioners are pushing forward with a plan to impose a one-year pause on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining in the North Carolina county, citing concerns about its impact on the environment and the community according to reporting by WLOS ABC13. 
Currently, the county's ordinances do not define cryptocurrency mining as a specific use, prompting officials to consider a temporary halt on the activity while regulations are developed.
A public hearing has been set for May 2 to discuss the proposed moratorium, providing the community with an opportunity to share their views on the issue. 
The surge in mining operations across America has raised concerns amongst critics about the environmental impact of the activity. A Texas Senate committee recently hosted a hearing in regards to legislation that would limit energy agreements used by Bitcoin miners, along with stopping favorable tax legislation. This legislation passed through the Senate committee, bringing it one step closer to reality.
US Bitcoin Corp, a Bitcoin mining company operating in Niagara Falls, also recently reached a tentative agreement with the city to resume operations after the facility was halted by a state supreme court judge’s ruling. 
Along with fines and legal fees, the miner would be forced to comply with noise ordinances and other regulations designed to limit the facility’s impact on its surrounding community.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new Launchpad will provide those looking to inscribe directly onto Bitcoin an easy way to build their collection.
Magic Eden, an NFT platform, has announced the opening of a Launchpad to inscribe collections using the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin. 
This comes shortly after the platform's launch of an Ordinals marketplace, which has helped Magic Eden become the “top marketplace for trading Bitcoin inscriptions,” according to the press release.
The press release describes the company’s goal of offering a safe and secure platform for creators to launch their collections, with the first collection launch scheduled for April 7, 2023. According to the release, the platform has already served over 500 creators and raised over $150 million on their behalf.
Zhuoxun Yin, COO, and co-founder of Magic Eden commented on the announcement, "We're excited to expand our creator capabilities to Bitcoin and offer easy ways for creators to get started and launch... With Ordinals, content can be preserved forever, and we're proud to be helping creators and the Ordinals community grow together." 
Magic Eden's move to provide creators with a Launchpad for Bitcoin inscriptions comes at a time when Bitcoin inscriptions have seen a significant uptick in popularity throughout Q1 2023, as the press release describes. 
The Ordinals protocol allows users to insert arbitrary data onto specific UTXOs, effectively enabling immutable NFTs built directly into the Bitcoin blockchain. Since the launch of the protocol, its impacts have been debated. That being said, almost 1,000,000 pieces of data have been inscribed onto the blockchain already as of the time of writing, and there are no signs of that stopping.]]></summary>
