its operations, marking the final chapter for the parent company of Silvergate  
Bank, Reuters reported. The La Jolla-based institution shut down operations  
earlier in 2023 following a crippling run on deposits caused by the chaos in

2019 to $14.3 billion by 2021, with over half of these deposits coming from  
digital asset exchange customers.

However, the tide is starting to turn as there could be a recovery trend for the crypto market very soon.
