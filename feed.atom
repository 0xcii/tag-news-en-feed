        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin (BTC) market appears to be now experiencing a concerning trend, according to the latest report from an on-chain data provider, CryptoQuant. In the report, CryptoQuant discloses a notable slowdown in the growth of whale holdings, which refers to the accumulation of Bitcoin by large-scale investors.
 
The report reveals that the implication of this trend may be quite negative for BTC. This is because, usually, Bitcoin whales, who hold substantial amounts of BTC, have a considerable influence on the market.
