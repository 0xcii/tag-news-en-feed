        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unchained, a Bitcoin custodial services company, has announced the launch of its private client service with collaborative custody. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the new platform called “Unchained Signature” is a “membership-based service that helps high-net-worth individuals, institutions and corporations invest in and manage their bitcoin.”
The company compares the experience to that of premium banking services, but with the added twist of multi-signature custodial models that Unchained is known for. “The fact that clients hold their own bitcoin keys, even when they get a loan with their bitcoin used as collateral, is an assurance that Unchained is not able to singularly move or rehypothecate client funds, as many now-defunct crypto firms did prior to their collapse,” the press release stated.
Dedicated account management features described include private trade execution, multi-million dollar loans and retirement and estate planning — plus technical support, even to the extent that advisors will travel in-person for assistance during emergencies. In addition, Signature clients will receive early access to Unchained’s latest products as well as exclusive access to networking events. 
“As the best performing asset of the last decade, bitcoin continues to draw in new high-net-worth individuals and institutions, many of whom have previously shied away from crypto due to technical barriers and third-party risks,” said Joe Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Unchained, as he described the company’s opportunity. “Unchained Signature exists to help these investors buy, secure, and grow their bitcoin with as much technical and logistical assistance as they need — all without compromising security.”]]></summary>

Recently, social media and cryptocurrency-related forums have been abuzz with discussions about an “altcoin season” and the unprecedented duration without one. Essentially, an altcoin season is a period in the cryptocurrency market when the prices of alternative cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins, surge in comparison to bitcoin (BTC) for several weeks or months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon was a notable mover on Tuesday, as the token surged by as much as 8% in today’s session. The move saw the cryptocurrency hit a one-month high, following a recent five-day bull run. Solana also rose higher, following a sell-off to start the week.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) rose by as much as 8% earlier in today’s session, hitting a one-month high in the process.
 
Following a low of $0.7033 earlier in the day, MATIC/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $0.7473 on Tuesday.
 
As a result of this surge, MATIC hit its highest point since June 9, which is the last time the token broke out of a ceiling at $0.7480.
 
 
MATIC bulls were unable to breach this ceiling in today’s session, with the price retreating from an earlier high.
 
This comes despite the relative strength index (RSI) marginally breaking out of a ceiling at 59.00, with a current reading of 59.31.
 
In the event the index continues to strengthen, the odds of a breakout above $0.7480 will greatly increase.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
After dropping by nearly 7% to start the week, solana (SOL) bulls moved to buy the dip, with price now closing in on a fresh multi-month high.
 
SOL/USD jumped to a high of $22.29 earlier in the day, which is less than 24 hours after almost falling below $20.00.
 
Tuesday’s peak sees the world’s ninth largest cryptocurrency $0.20 away from a recent two-month high at $22.49.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it seems that traders reentered the market after the RSI hit a support level at 65.00
 
As of writing, price strength is at a reading of 69.05, with the next visible resistance zone at 72.00.
 
Should today’s momentum extend throughout the week, there is a good chance that solana will climb past $23.00.

Polygon Network Growth Has Been Steadily Rising Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, MATIC addresses are being created at an increasingly faster rate. The relevant indicator here is the “network growth,” which measures the total amount of new Polygon addresses that are coming online on the blockchain.
 
New addresses may be considered analogous to new users coming into the network, so this metric can provide us with hints about how the adoption of the cryptocurrency is coming along.
 
When the value of the indicator is high, it means that a large number of new addresses are being created on the network right now. Naturally, th…]]></summary>
