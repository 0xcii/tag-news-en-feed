        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s X account announced the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Tuesday. However, minutes later, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler claimed that the agency’s social media account was compromised and the post was unauthorized. Some suspect an internal SEC error behind the premature bitcoin ETF announcement.
 
SEC’s ‘Unauthorized’ Spot Bitcoin ETF Announcement
 
Amidst soaring anticipation for potential spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, an official U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) account on social media platform X announced on Tuesday that the regulator has approved spot bitcoin ETFs for trading on all registered national securities exchanges.

One of those who have chipped in their two cents is former SEC chairman Jay Clayton who believes that the Spot ETF is a matter of when and not if.
 
Spot Bitcoin ETF Is Inevitable
 
The former SEC chairman joined CNBC on its famous ‘Squawk Box’ show where he shared his expectations for the 13 pending Bitcoin Spot ETF applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unlike some who have taken a more conservative stance, Clayton has chosen to go the route of absolute certainty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  
encountered a significant stir as its Twitter account appeared to announce  
approvals for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) prematurely. 
However, contrary to the tweet's assertion, SEC  
Chair Gary Gensler confirmed that no spot Bitcoin ETF applications had received  
approval as of Tuesday afternoon. The regulator's official statement debunked  
the tweet due to an account compromise, underscoring that the SEC had not  
endorsed the listing or trading of such ETFs.

The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.
— Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) January 9, 2024
Despite this incident, expectations loom for the  
SEC's future approval of spot Bitcoin ETF applications, though no such approval  
had transpired by the time of the compromised tweet. 
The SEC's Statement
Gensler took to his Twitter account to clarify the  
misunderstanding, affirming the lack of authorization to spot Bitcoin ETFs. The  
SEC's spokesperson echoed this sentiment via email, categorically denying the  
legitimacy of the tweet that circulated misinformation regarding Bitcoin ETF  
approvals.
Similarly, the SEC's Twitter account highlighted the fuss caused by the manipulated announcement about approving the Bitcoin ETFs. Its official statement, arising from a compromised account, firmly stated that the SEC didn't support or approve the trading or listing of these ETFs.

The @SECGov X account was compromised, and an unauthorized post was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler addressed the situation, clarifying that the SEC’s X account had indeed been compromised, and the tweet was not legitimate. Gensler emphasized that the SEC had not granted approval for the listing and trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Gensler stated:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Charles Gasparino, FOX Business Senior Correspondent, has reported that the long-anticipated Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are indeed a "done deal," with trading slated to commence this Thursday. 



This confirmation from FOX Business cements earlier speculations, affirming that the final green light for Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been granted, signaling an imminent leap into the regulated investment sphere for Bitcoin.
The potential commencement of trading on Thursday would mark a watershed moment for the Bitcoin industry, providing a gateway for both institutional and retail investors to access BTC exposure through traditional financial instruments.
It is important to note that the SEC has not yet officially approved any spot Bitcoin ETFs at the time of writing. But with the approval or denial decision due tomorrow, it is expected by industry experts that the ETFs will be approved.
As the countdown begins towards tomorrows expected approval and Thursdays potential launch, anticipation builds among market participants, eager to witness this historic milestone that is poised to reshape the dynamics of Bitcoin investments and potentially pave the way for further institutional adoption of Bitcoin.]]></summary>

Whatever events unfold from here, it’s worth considering why now is the right time for ETFs to get the green light, and how Bitcoin and the wider crypto industry may be affected from here.
Why Are ETFs Happening Now?
The first ever application for a bitcoin ETF was from the Winklevoss brothers, back in 2013 when BTC was trading below $100, and subsequent to that, there have been multiple further attempts, from the likes of Gemini (founded by the Winklevoss brothers), Ark Invest and Grayscale. None were accepted, and the SEC appeared intransigent.

Spot Bitcoin ETF in the US
Companies have been seeking approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs for years now. However, the US regulators have delayed and rejected the applications, citing risks of market manipulation and its inability to protect retail investors.
A total of 14 asset managers have submitted for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. While the crypto-centric companies submitted the initial applications, the interest from Blackrock, the largest traditional asset manager, for a spot Bitcoin ETF drove fresh optimism for the instrument.

This signals a phase of “extreme greed,” a sentiment intensity not witnessed since the cryptocurrency’s previous bull run in November 2021.
 
Soaring Bitcoin Drives Greed Index to New Highs
 

 
On Jan. 9, 2024, the CFGI, available on alternative.me, soared to its highest level of 76 out of 100 since its last peak in November 2021. The index functions on the premise that extreme fear can cause bitcoin (BTC) to trade significantly below its fair value, whereas extreme greed might lead to an overvalued state. The CFGI assesses various elements, including volatility, market momentum and volume, social media sentiments, dominance, and trends.

Pushing things off-chain is attempting to make the use of the scarce resource that blockspace is much more efficient to accommodate a materially larger user base than the blockchain can facilitate on its own. Jevon’s Paradox states that in the presence of elastic demand for something, when the efficiency of using that thing increases, i.e. the cost per use decreases, the aggregate demand for that thing among participants will increase.
