Dark Defender stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the XRP price could extend toward $18.22 when Wave 3 occurs. He believes that Wave 3 will initially cause XRP’s price to rise to between $1.88 and $5.85 and could then further move to the $18 price level thanks to the Fibonacci levels, “which can extend exponentially.”

This significant price movement can be attributed to three key factors: the influx of investments into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), notable activities in the futures market, and a technical breakout from a period of compression.
