Bitcoin Cash Hashrate Sees Surge in Interest as Mining Profitability Outshines Bitcoin
 
In the last 24 hours, the crypto market has been quite unstable, particularly following the release of May’s personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which showed a 0.1% increase.
 
Although several major cryptocurrencies lost value in response to this news, bitcoin cash (BCH) remains up by over 20% in just one day and more than 100% in a week. Two-wee…]]></summary>

The series of events began over a week ago when Elon Musk took to Twitter, stating his willingness to engage in a ‘cage fight’ with Mark Zuckerberg.
 
In response, the CEO of Meta asked Musk to provide a location for the potential fight through a social media post. He humorously referred to his fighting strategy as ‘walrus-style,’ which involves lying on top of his opponent without taking any action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Bitcoin miners collect and broadcast transactions in a block and verify their validity. Then they apply a cryptographic hash function of the previous block's header to the new block. Finally, they try to solve the proof-of-work problem. Satoshi Nakamoto adopted a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to resolve the Byzantine Generals' Problem, establishing a transparent and objective protocol.
What Is Proof Of Work (PoW)?
Proof of work is literally proof that work has been done to validate the network’s transactions and generate new bitcoin. It is the consensus mechanism and algorithm that uses computing power to verify transactions and add them to the Bitcoin blockchain. Such a mechanism allows the Bitcoin network to be trusted and remain decentralized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sabre56, a leading hosting provider and Bitcoin and digital asset mining consultancy, has signed a consultancy deal with Arkon Energy for the management of Arkon's recently acquired data center in Hannibal, Ohio. Sabre56 will oversee logistics, equipment sourcing and procurement, design planning and overall cost management of the data center.
Phil Harvey, CEO of Sabre56, expressed pride in the deepening strategic partnership with Arkon Energy, stating, "It is an honor to collaborate on the company's first U.S data center." He also mentioned the sustained demand for their delivery services and their continued consultation with other market leaders constructing their facilities.
Arkon Energy's CEO, Joshua Payne, shared his enthusiasm for securing their first data center in the United States and expressed confidence in their consulting partner, Sabre56. Payne stated, "Hannibal, Ohio, will only be the first of several acquisitions as Arkon Energy is building out its U.S. footprint."
This collaboration builds upon the two companies’ successful history of project cooperation, including Sabre56's involvement in procuring a Norwegian facility later purchased by Arkon Energy.
The deal comes at a time of growing optimism in the crypto environment, with asset managers like BlackRock aggressively seeking market share. In May, Sabre56's newly constructed facility in Wyoming attracted GEM Mining, which reserved space for 4,510 miners, highlighting the company's reputation for cutting-edge hosting sites.]]></summary>

It is worth noting that the defendants have agreed to the SEC’s request for an extension, as stated in a legal document filing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin surged by as much as 20% in today’s session, as bulls took the token to its highest level since April. The move came prior to the latest consumer sentiment report from the U.S, which rose to a reading of 64.4. Bitcoin cash climbed to its highest point since April 2022. 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) rose above $100.00 for the first time since April, as traders seemingly remained bullish on the token following its recent listing on EDX markets.
 
LTC/USD hit an intraday peak of $102.38 earlier in today’s session, which came following a low of $84.25 the day before.
 
As a result of the rally, litecoin peaked at its strongest point since April 18, when price reached a top at $103.41.
 
 
Today’s move came as bulls were able to break out of a recent resistance level of $98.00, with the relative strength index (RSI) doing similar.
 
Litecoin’s price strength surged past a ceiling at the 62.00 mark, on its way to a current reading of 65.43.
 
Should momentum continue, bulls will likely ease pressure closer to an upcoming level of 68.00.
 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) made significant gains for a second straight session, this time rising by over 20% to end the week.
 
Following a low of $241.21 on Thursday, BCH/USD raced to an intraday high at $312.77 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this latest rally, BCH moved to its strongest point since April 18 last year, when price peaked at $345.00.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the latest rally has sent the RSI to a current reading of 86.97, which is significantly overbought.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average has also made a relatively high leap away from its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
This could signal a potential top, which could be tempting for bears waiting for the perfect time to reenter the market.
