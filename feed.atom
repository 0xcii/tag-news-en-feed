        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm with an insatiable appetite for bitcoin, sent ripples through the market this week after announcing a $500 million convertible debt offering. The company plans to use the proceeds to fuel its ever-growing bitcoin treasury, a strategy that has propelled its stock price to dizzying heights but also introduced significant risk.
 
 
The news unsettled investors, with MicroStrategy’s stock price tumbling 1.5% in pre-market trading. The concern? The added debt burden and the company’s unwavering commitment to a volatile asset class over its core software business. Bitcoin itself wasn’t immune to the jitters, experiencing a modest 0.7% price dip.
