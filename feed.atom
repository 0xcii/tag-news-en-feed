        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/secure-your-bitcoin-vault-with-a-yubikey-casa"/>
        <updated>2024-07-26T16:01:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Casa, a leading provider of Bitcoin self-custody services, has announced an integration with YubiKeys, enabling users to secure their Bitcoin vaults with Yubikeys. 
YubiKeys are small physical devices that provide multi-factor authentication and securely store sensitive data like passwords and keys. By integrating support for YubiKeys, Casa members can now use the devices as one of the keys in their multi-signature Bitcoin vaults.
When setting up a YubiKey with Casa, users generate a Bitcoin seed phrase locally on their computer. This seed is then stored on the YubiKey itself, protected by a passkey. 
The integration uses passkey cryptography to ensure the seed phrase never leaves the YubiKey and can only be accessed when authenticating through Casa's service.
Casa emphasises this provides superior security over traditional wallet recovery seeds, which can be vulnerable to phishing and theft if written down or stored digitally. With a YubiKey, the seed is cryptographically bound to Casa's domain, preventing phishing attacks.
By integrating with YubiKeys, Casa provides its members with more flexibility in securing their Bitcoin. YubiKeys offer convenience through their compact size and easy tap-to-use authentication. The company plans to open-source the core integration code in the future.
The launch demonstrates growing development in Bitcoin self-custody approaches as demand grows from both retail and institutional users to make self-custody more secure, better, and easier.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since June, trade volume for Binance Coin (BNB) has surged almost 6,000%. Several important events inside the Binance ecosystem that have attracted the interest of both market watchers and investors will help to explain this explosive rise.
 
At the time of writing, BNB was trading at $579, up nearly 3% and 0.9%, respectively, in the 24-hour and weekly frames, data by Coingecko shows.
 
 
The latest ending of the SEC’s probe on Binance’s stablecoin issuer marks one of the most important factors fueling this increase. Putting an end to this investigation has provided much-needed legal clarity, solving long-standing problems that have been hanging over the Binance environment. Binance sees the SEC’s decision as a big win because it will help buyers trust them again.

Earlier this month, the Republican National Committee adopted an ambitious platform to promote innovation in the US’ digital assets industry and protect the rights of bitcoin holders.
For one, the official platform pledges that the Republicans will “defend the right to mine bitcoin.” This represents a much-needed departure from the policies of the incumbent…]]></summary>
