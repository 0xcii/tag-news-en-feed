        <updated>2024-08-29T13:48:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia's two spot Bitcoin ETFs—the VanEck Bitcoin ETF and Monochrome's IBTC—have steadily accumulated Bitcoin holdings since launching earlier this year. The sustained inflows highlight growing Bitcoin demand in the region.
The VanEck Bitcoin ETF debuted on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on June 20th after receiving regulatory approval. It has attracted $40.72 million in assets under management (AUM).
Meanwhile, the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) began trading on the smaller CBOE Australia exchange on June 4th. Despite its lower AUM, IBTC continues to see small but steady inflows.
As of August 28th, IBTC holds around 123 Bitcoin worth $7.4 million. The fund has continually purchased BTC on dips, regardless of price action or sentiment.

This contrasts with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have faced outflows amid Bitcoin's failure to convincingly break $60,000. Prominent products from Ark Invest and Grayscale saw major withdrawals this week.
While assets under management remain low, the Australian ETFs are growing steadily. The sustained inflows point to rising interest in Bitcoin in the region. The increasing demand for regulated investment vehicles can boost mainstream acceptance. If growth continues, Australia's spot Bitcoin ETFs could emerge as significant sources of BTC demand.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genesis Digital Assets (GDA), one of the world's largest Bitcoin mining companies, has announced plans to expand its recently launched Texas data centre to 400 megawatts. The ambitious phase two scaling highlights GDA's commitment to Texas as a mining hub, leveraging the state's renewable energy and pro-innovation policies.
GDA's Rowdy Data Center in Vernon is currently operational at 60 MW, supported by the Oklaunion Substation. The site benefits from substantial local wind power and is located near Vernon city in Wilbarger County.
The data centre utilizes grid power with renewable energy sources for its operations. "GDA's business is a natural fit for the Oklaunion Power Station," said Tom Walker, Chairman of OPS Board. "This project clearly demonstrates that Bitcoin mining creates entirely new dynamics for the energy industry."
The Rowdy Data Center repurposes the retired Oklaunion Power Station, bringing back dozens of jobs lost when the plant closed in 2020. So far, GDA's operations have generated 12 permanent and 150 construction jobs.
"Texas has emerged as a leading hub for local support and renewable energy sources, and the Rowdy data centre is a particularly important location for our operations," said GDA CEO Andrey Kim.
The company aims to bolster the Bitcoin network's robustness and security by scaling and innovating mining infrastructure and utilizing renewable energy sources.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many operators, high market volatility has turned Bitcoin mining into a real rollercoaster. But, some operators enjoy a smooth ride: in just one week, miners reported more than $3.40 million in profits.
 
 
This surge in profit comes at an important time after a period of uncertainty in the cost of operation and the value of Bitcoin, to which miners had to promptly adapt in view of the changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market.
 
Data from the analytic platform CryptoQuant outlined notable surges in miner’s realized profit. One of those surges happened in mid-July when early miners profited more than $1.8 million.
