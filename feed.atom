        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the US economy slowing down, many are looking at Bitcoin as the next big safe haven, much like gold did during the 1930s. And with the continued downturn in US economic data, many have been speculating on how cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, would react to this perfect storm brewing.
 
 
Popular analyst Michaël van de Poppe says Bitcoin could very well follow the trajectory of the historic rise of gold during the Great Depression.
 
As views on US debt, inflation, and rising interest rates pile up, Bitcoin is increasingly touted as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Van de Poppe is among the analysts taking the view that Bitcoin will have its ultimate rally very soon and that it will be sustained via rate cuts and quantitative easing policies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s no denying that Bitcoin has significantly underperformed in recent months and has fallen short of the high expectations held by many bullish market participants. This underperformance has been especially evident in the past few weeks, where the cryptocurrency has faced considerable declines. Bitcoin’s price has dropped by 8.2% over the last seven days and 5.4% in the past 20 days, pushing more short-term holders into losses.
 
 
A well-known crypto analyst, Caleb Franzen, recently weighed in on the situation through a post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). According to Franzen, Bitcoin’s underwhelming performance has now positioned the cryptocurrency at a crucial position that would determine a bull market continuation.

The report showed that the economy added only 142,000 jobs in August, which was much below expectations and threw the crypto market into volatility.
 
 
The abrupt U-turn drove the crypto ecology into a tailspin. After striking a low of $53,780, Bitcoin lost roughly 4% in the past 24 hours and traded for $54,101. Following the dismal job count, there was conjecture on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts; estimates of a 70% probability of a 25 basis-point drop at the next FOMC meeting on September 18.
