— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 26, 2024
  
  
  
The milestone comes just months after Hong Kong approved its first spot bitcoin ETFs, following similar moves in the U.S. and Europe. The ETFs provide exposure to Bitcoin prices without directly owning Bitcoin.
While volumes have been slower than U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, assets under management have steadily climbed. This suggests a growing institutional appetite for regulated Bitcoin products in Asia.
The ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF is the largest of the Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs, with over $142 million in net assets. Bosera Hashkey's Bitcoin ETF comes next with around $99 million in holdings, followed by Harvest Bitcoin ETF with $31 million. Together, the total Bitcoin holdings across the three Hong Kong ETFs stand at approximately 4,450 BTC, worth $272 million at current prices.
Industry observers believe innovations like the ETFs' redemption method could attract more capital over time. The Hong Kong products allow for in-kind redemptions using actual Bitcoin, unlike cash-only U.S. ETFs.
The growth indicates increasing Bitcoin adoption by institutional investors in Asia. If interest in Hong Kong's spot Bitcoin ETFs continues at the current pace, they could emerge as a significant regional pool of Bitcoin demand.
Other Asian countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, and South Korea, are also in the pipeline to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. This could further integrate Bitcoin within mainstream finance across the continent.]]></summary>

The August 23 raid followed string after string of complaints by locals over incessant power outages that had been ongoing for well over a month.
 
It was discovered that the mining operation was the likely cause behind the disruptions by the Provincial Electricity Authority.
 
 
Illegal Bitcoin Mine Operations Cracked Down
 
In the operation, security authorities found bitcoin mining rigs mounted in a rental house. Consumption records of electricity gave abnormal figures; however, the payment records for electricity showed a significantly minimal charge, said Jamnong Chanwong, the chief district security officer.

The Vision For A Shiba Inu DAO
 
Lucie emphasized that Shiba Inu currently stands as the 13th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a testament to its dramatic rise since its inception in 2020 by the enigmatic founder known only as Ryoshi. Initially conceived as a token without a predefined purpose, Shib was designed to explore the possibilities of a fully community-driven cryptocurrency. Ryoshi‘s relinquishing of control by burning the keys to the token’s supply marked a pivotal moment, entrusting the project to Shytoshi Kusama and a team of volunteers.

Encrypted Messaging Under Attack
