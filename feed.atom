Alesia Haas, Coinbase’s Chief Financial Officer, disclosed this information during a discussion at Citi’s 2024 Global TMT Conference in New York, as reported by Fortune.
 
A Shift In Democratic Attitude Toward Crypto?
 
Following Haas’s announcement, a Coinbase spokesperson confirmed to the news outlet that Future Forward, Harris’s official political action committee (PAC), has indeed joined Coinbase Commerce. 
 
The platform, which has been operational since 2018, allows merchants to easily accept cryptocurrency payments. However, the Harris campaign has yet to publicly address this development.
