        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto world is still reeling from the financial collapse of the Sam Bankman-Fried empire, FTX. With major exchanges taking proactive measures to prevent an imminent implosion, no one is certain how long this storm will last.
 
The ripple effect of this lack of credibility from FTX has led many centralized exchanges to murky waters. For instance, Gemini has downsized its staff to make up for deficits with the fear index high in the market. 
 
Due to the gross misappropriation of funds – in the past, the scrutiny is now more than ever on exchanges.
 
Binance – the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, is now in the eye of the storm. The United States Department of Justice; is divided on its decision to charge the exchange.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-shib-slips-to-20-day-low-doge-also-declines/"/>
        <updated>2022-12-12T16:31:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was in the red to start the week, with prices falling to a 20-day low on Monday. The meme coin has now moved lower for four straight sessions, with the latest decline seeing price move below a key support point. Dogecoin was also down, hitting a two-week low earlier today.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was down on Monday, as the meme coin moved to its lowest point in the past 20 days.
 
Following a high of $0.000009282, SHIB/USD was down by nearly 5% today, hitting a low of $0.000008794 in the process.
 
This bottom is the lowest point that SHIB has traded at since November 22, when the token was at a low of $0.00000817.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the move comes as shiba inu broke out of a floor at the $0.00000885 mark.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also fell, dropping below a floor at the 43.70 level in the process.
 
Should this bearish momentum continue, we could see SHIB sellers attempt to recapture the low last seen on November 22.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) also remained in the red to start the week, as it also declined for a fourth straight day.
 
DOGE/USD declined to an intraday low of $0.08729 on Monday, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $0.09682.
 
As a result of this decline, which saw DOGE drop by nearly 10%, the token hit its lowest point since November 25.
 
 
Looking at the chart, bearish momentum has recently intensified following a drop below a floor of 48.00 on the RSI.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average also appears to be heading towards its 25-day (blue) counterpart, with a downward cross looking inevitable.
 
Should this crossover take place, it is likely that DOGE will move even lower, with a floor of $0.080 a possible destination.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Justice officials are reportedly deciding whether they have sufficient evidence to bring charges against the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.

A Reuters report stated that several sources close to the investigation claim there is deliberation on whether to not to file charges against individual Binance executives including CEO Changpeng Zhao.
Others within the investigating entities, which include the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), have argued in favor of reviewing more evidence. 
The investigation, which was launched nearly two years ago, comes at a precarious time for the industry as it reels from the collapse of FTX.

Binance has responded to the Reuters report, stating on Twitter, “Reuters has it wrong again. Now they're attacking our incredible law enforcement team. A team that we're incredibly proud of - they've made crypto more secure for all of us,” with a link below to a blog post highlighting their claims of the competency of their security team. 
According to Reuters’ sources, “discussions included potential plea deals,” in relation to charges of “unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy and criminal sanctions violations.” 
As the news source notes, the investing bodies could bring an indictment against Binance and executives at the company, could accept a settlement or could do nothing to the company. Binance has reportedly argued that “A criminal prosecution would wreak havoc on a crypto market already in a prolonged downturn.”
The cryptocurrency exchange responded to the investigation by hiring a former chief of MLARS, Kendall Day, who reportedly has been meeting with Justice officials and communicating with investigators. 
Binance is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange with a 24 hour trading volume of about $10.5 billion on the day of reporting. A separate U.S. entity exists, Binance.US. The international company does not have an official headquarters according to the CEO.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was trading under $17,000 to start the week, as markets prepared for a big week of economic announcements. U.S. inflation figures will be released tomorrow, and are expected to fall to 7.3%. Many believe this will give way to the Federal Reserve pivoting from its aggressive rate hike policy. Ethereum was also lower, and is trading below $1,250 as of writing.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the week in the red, as traders prepared for a big week of economic announcements from the United States.
 
Inflation figures will be released on Tuesday, and are expected to fall to 7.3%, down from 7.7% the month prior.
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $16,899.39 during Monday’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $17,245.64.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, today’s decline saw bitcoin move lower for a fourth straight day, edging closer to a floor of $16,700 in the process.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is currently tracking at 47.42, is also nearing a resistance of its own at 46.00.
 
Depending on tomorrow’s inflation figure we could see BTC move below $16,700, and potentially towards the $16,000 mark.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also trended downwards on Monday, with prices falling for a second consecutive session.
 
Following a high of $1,281.78 on Sunday, ETH/USD moved to a bottom of $1,243.48 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw ethereum fall to its lowest point since November 8, and it is now nearing a floor of $1,230.
 
 
Looking at the chart, recent bearish sentiment in ETH returned once the RSI failed to break out of a ceiling of 52.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 48.60, and now seems to be moving towards a floor of 45.30.
 
Despite this downtrend, the 10-day (red) moving average still remains above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.

After FTX’s bankruptcy, almost all major crypto exchanges have started to provide a supposed proof that they are not speculating with their customers’ funds and hold them in full.
 
Since there is no industry-wide standard for Proof of Reserves (PoR) yet, the community is looking particularly critically at the exchanges’ approach. And Changpeng Zhao’s Binance and its latest PoR are, of course, at the top of the list.
 
The Wall Street Journal recently published a report that comes down hard on Binance. The exchange hired an outside accounting firm to prepare a “proof-of-reserve report” covering some of its assets and liabilities.
