Piers Morgan, known for his blunt takes, labeled Bitcoin traders as “mugs,” questioning the very viability of the digital currency. But Jordan Belfort, the infamous “Wolf of Wall Street,” offered a more nuanced perspective, acknowledging a shift in the investor landscape and Bitcoin’s evolving narrative.
 
 
Are Bitcoin Traders ‘Mugs?’
 
Morgan, ever the skeptic, painted a picture of a speculative bubble fueled by gullible participants. “Isn’t it just a case of enough mugs trading it with each other, making it go up?” he pondered, dismissing the asset as mere hype.
 
Yet, Belfort, once a harsh critic himself, surprised viewers by acknowledging a new breed of “smart mugs” ent…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New York Attorney General Letitia James has expanded  
her legal pursuit against Digital Currency Group (DCG), its CEO Barry Silbert,  
and Genesis Global Capital. The amended complaint, following the initial lawsuit filed last year, exposes an additional $2 billion in fraud, bringing the total  
losses suffered by more than 230,000 investors to $3 billion. 
Alleged Deceptive Practices
As the lawsuit filed on October 2023 against Gemini, Genesis,  
and DCG unfolded, it became evident that the cryptocurrency industry was  
grappling with a massive fraud orchestrated by these entities. According to James, the initial suit  
shed light on misleading representations regarding the Gemini Earn investment
