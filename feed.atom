This review aims to illuminate the evolving regulatory landscape and highlight key areas of concern and significance.
 
The study begins by examining the risks associated with using Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) for long-term storage of funds, particularly in light of recent CEX troubles. The review advises against using CEXs for long-term storage, even for the largest Tier 1 CEXs, due to potential risks such as regulatory enforcement, fraud, and liquidity issues​​.

According to an anonymous source cited by The Block, the filing could be submitted as early as Tuesday. This move would put Fidelity in the growing race to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF, which was triggered by BlackRock’s filing earlier this month. 
 
Bitcoin ETF Race Heats Up Amidst Growing Institutional Interest
 
Fidelity’s interest in a spot BTC ETF is not new. The company filed for a similar product, the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, in 2021, but it was denied by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early 2022.

Vishal, who previously worked for a financial regulator in Abu Dhabi, explained that MiCA is a comprehensive set of regulations for cryptocurrencies that treats them as financial services. He highlighted that MiCA brings uniformity to the registration and anti-money laundering requirements for crypto asset service providers across Europe, allowing for passporting of licenses throughout the region.

        <updated>2023-06-27T16:08:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash rose to a one-year high on Tuesday, as traders continued to buy the token following last week’s EDX markets listing. The newly formed exchange, which is backed by the likes of Citadel, Sequoia Capital and Fidelity, listed the coin in its offering. Litecoin was another token added to the exchange. 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was one of Tuesday’s notable gainers, as the token surged to a one-year high.
 
Following a low of $197.30 to start the week, BCH/USD raced to an intraday peak of $236.64 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s peak bitcoin cash moved nearly 18% higher, hitting its strongest point since May 2022 in the process.
 
 
From the chart, a breakout above a ceiling at 80.00 on the relative strength index (RSI) appears to be one of the reasons for today’s surge.
 
The index is now tracking at 82.55, which is deep in overbought territory, and comes as price rose by 120% in the last seven days.
 
Bears are likely already circling the token, anticipating a potential change in direction in the coming days.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was another token to be listed on the EDX platform, however prices have not risen to the extent of BCH.
 
LTC/USD snapped a three-day losing streak on Tuesday, climbing to a peak of $89.90 earlier in the day.
 
This comes less than 24 hours after the cryptocurrency fell to a bottom at $86.42, despite a recent crossover of moving averages.
 
 
The 10-day (red) moving average rose above its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which typically signals bullish momentum.
 
In order for this to truly materialize, a breakout of an upcoming ceiling at 58.00 on the RSI will need to occur.
 
As of writing, price strength is now tracking at 56.30.
