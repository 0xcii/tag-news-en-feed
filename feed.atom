The CEO of Sabre56, Phil Harvey, expressed his enthusiasm for the partnership with GEM Mining, emphasizing their shared values and dedication to advancing the mining industry. Harvey stated, "Sabre56 is rapidly implementing a strategic shift to build full-service hosting facilities with the highest technical and environmental standards ...

Bitcoin Miners Are Now Making Just $1.7 Million In Transaction Fees
 
Bitcoin miners earn revenue through two main sources: the block rewards they receive for solving blocks on the network and the transaction fees they earn for handling individual transfers.
 
In the last couple of years, the latter’s contribution towards the total revenue had been quite small, meaning that the miners had to survive on the block rewards alone.
 
Recently, however, the transaction fee revenue of these chain validators observed explosively high values, thanks to the BRC-20 tokens frenzy that had taken over the market.
 
Generally, the transfer fee remains low when there is little traffic…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Trading at Lower Rates on Binance Australia
 
Australians traded bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies at discount on Binance Australia compared to other exchanges operating in the country on Tuesday. The price difference has been attributed to a popular domestic payment provider’s decision to quit processing withdrawals in Australian dollars (AUD) for its users.
 
Starting from June 1, customers of Binance’s Australian platform will not be able to withdraw amounts in the national fiat to their ba…]]></summary>

The event will increase the circulating supply of OP tokens by over 100%. Analysts opine that the upcoming unlock event might affect OP’s price negatively.
 
OP Price Might Dip As Early Investors Cash In
 
Token unlocks in the crypto market are scheduled events that release early investors’ locked tokens after freezing them for a specific period. 
 
Crypto communities use token locks to avoid large asset sales in low liquidity periods. Selling during these periods could have an impact on the price of the token. 
 
But these events increase the number of tokens in circulation, creating an imbalance…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dr. Saifedean Ammous, prominent economist and author of "The Bitcoin Standard," is poised to take on a new role as an Economic Advisor to El Salvador's Bitcoin Office. This appointment comes after El Salvador made history by becoming the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021.
“Having Saifedean Ammous on team El Salvador is fantastic,” Max Keiser, Senior Bitcoin Advisor to the country said in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine. “Ammous brilliantly captured the role of Bitcoin as, ‘The alternative to Central Banking’ in his now classic, ‘The Bitcoin Standard’ as well as the philosophy of Bitcoin including popularizing the idea of 'time preference' as a life-hack. This news makes me very happy.”
Ammous, known for his expertise in Bitcoin and monetary economics, is expected to provide valuable guidance and insights to the Bitcoin Office as it navigates the implementation and integration of Bitcoin into the country's economy. His extensive knowledge and research on the subject have earned him recognition within the community and beyond.
The Bitcoin Law, proposed by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele and approved by the Legislative Assembly, has set the stage for a new era in the country's financial landscape. With Ammous joining as an Economic Advisor, El Salvador aims to leverage his expertise to maximize the benefits and address potential challenges associated with adopting bitcoin as legal tender.
The Bitcoin Office, established to oversee the implementation of the Bitcoin Law, will likely benefit from Ammous' insights on monetary policy, sound money principles and the potential economic implications of embracing a decentralized digital currency. His appointment signals El Salvador's commitment to incorporating expert opinions into their strategy and decision-making process.]]></summary>
