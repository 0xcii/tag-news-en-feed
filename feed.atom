        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ltc-link-rebound-on-monday-despite-crypto-market-red-wave/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin rose marginally higher to start the week, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly trading lower on Monday. The global crypto market cap is down 0.15% at the time of writing, as volatility remains high. Chainlink also moved higher in today’s session.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) bounced from a key point of support to start the week, as the token rallied, despite Monday’s crypto red wave.
 
Following a low of $84.92 on Sunday, LTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $88.89 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of this move, litecoin moved further away from its price floor at $86.00, and is now trading at its highest point since last Friday.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has now risen to a point of resistance at 45.00, leading to LTC giving up earlier gains.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.33, with litecoin trading at $88.11.
 
Should price strength move beyond the 45.00 mark, there is a good chance that LTC will be back above $90.00.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) was also in the green in today’s session, and the token rose by as much as 2%.
 
LINK/USD climbed to a peak of $7.25 to start the week, following a low of $6.92 on Sunday.
 
Today’s rebound sees LINK move away from the three-and-a-half-week low registered over the weekend.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this coincides with the RSI bouncing from a floor of its own at the 44.00 mark.
 
Currently price strength is tracking at 45.09, with a resistance point at 47.00 a potential target for bulls.
 
Should it hit this mark, then it is likely that LINK will move above $7.30.

This is due to the fact that dormant wallets from that era are becoming a rarity to behold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week on the brink of a downwards crossover of two key moving average trend lines, which could signal an upcoming price drop. The 10-day and 25-day moving average look set to cross, potentially leading to a breakout of the $27,000 level. Ethereum is trading above a floor at $1,830 as of writing.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) is on the brink of registering a downward crossover of its 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
A recent downtrend, which today pushed BTC/USD to an intraday low of $27,192.03, has also led to an overall shift in market momentum.
 
This latest low in bitcoin comes less than a day after the world’s largest cryptocurrency traded at a high of $27,979.98.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, BTC is trading over 7% lower than at the same point last week, when the price was above $30,000.
 
In addition to the potential crossover of moving averages, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continues to hover close to a floor at 42.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.11, with BTC trading at $27,550.00.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also started the week in the red, with prices hovering close to a key point of support.
 
Following a high of $1,888.19 on Sunday, ETH/USD slipped to an intraday low of $1,831.16 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of this move, ethereum fell close to its long-term price floor at $1,830, however bulls have so far rejected a breakout.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
One of the reasons that a break has yet to occur seems to be due to the RSI, which continues to trend above support at 44.00
 
Price strength is now tracking at 45.58, with a ceiling at 52.00 a potential target for bulls hopeful of recapturing the $1,900 mark.

This is an opinion editorial by Source Node, a former sales account manager with a background in training and industrial-organizational psychology.
When I pitch Bitcoin to a relative, to a friend or to a complete stranger in the bathroom stall next to me, they will inevitably ask, "How is this benefiting you? Are you going to make money from me buying bitcoin?" 
In one sense, the honest answer is yes, but my main objective is actually to alleviate suffering.

Bulgaria, a small country located in Southeast Europe, nestled between Romania and Greece, is set to become one of the wealthiest countries in the world. 
The reason for this is its possession of 213,000 bitcoin, which its authorities seized from a group they labeled as criminals in 2017. According to the South East European Law Enforcement Center (SELC), the group hacked the Bulgarian customs agency’s computers and made changes to the system so that their partner companies could import goods while avoiding paying …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
