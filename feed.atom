        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to remove custodial risk from your bitcoin holdings, you must take self-custody. Bitcoin custody is determined by whoever has the keys to control the bitcoin—if you aren’t holding the keys to your bitcoin, then someone else is. As the saying goes, not your keys, not your coins.

Most people discover early on that hardware wallets are the most secure way to use bitcoin keys. However, the options don’t end with selecting a hardware wallet; you can also choose between singlesig, multisig, and a few other technologies that determine what is required to spend your bitcoin.
