After a lengthy legal battle, Judge Analisa Torres ruled partially in favor of Ripple Labs, saying XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors.

While the court determined that Ripple’s sale of XRP to institutional investors constituted an unlawful security sale, it found that XRP did not qualify as a security when sold to the general public.
