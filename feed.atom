The Bitcoin network runs on a consensus mechanism known as the “proof-of-work” (PoW). In this system, validators called miners compete with each other using computing power to get the chance to add the next block to the blockchain.
 
The “mining hashrate” refers to a measure of the total computing power the miners have currently connected to the network for this purpose.
 
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that either exiting miners are expanding their facilities or new miners are joining the chain. Such a trend implies these validators are finding the network attractive …]]></summary>
