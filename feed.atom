        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The leading cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has remained within a limited price range since yesterday. This followed yesterday’s quick surge to the $49K level, which then declined in the early trading hours of Thursday. Although there was a transient increase to the $47K mark, the value has stayed under the $46K threshold since that point. Notably, there has been minimal market movement and volume recorded at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday morning.
 
Bitcoin
 
On the 1-hour chart, bitcoin (BTC) exhibited a dramatic surge, touching a peak of approximately $49,048 on Jan. 11, 2024, indicative of a strong buying interest or a response to yesterday’s ETF listing news. This spike was followed by a swift decline, with the price finding support near $44,304. The current trend shows a downward trajecto…]]></summary>

This debut was far from ordinary. With nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs launching simultaneously, analysts were left scrambling for comparisons. “Trading volumes have been relatively strong for new ETF products,” admitted Todd Rosenbluth, strategist at VettaFi, “but this is a longer race than just a single day’s trading.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the recent approval of spot Bitcoin  
exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission  
(SEC), the South Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) firmly stated it  
would not permit the trading of cryptocurrencies on its local financial market.  

This decision, detailed in a press release yesterday  
(Thursday), sends a clear message that South Korea is cautious about the  
fast-growing crypto market.
The FSC's stance centers around the potential  
contradiction between domestic securities firms brokering overseas-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs and the South Korean government's position on virtual assets.

The FSC emphasized that such brokerage may violate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Base, the Coinbase incubated rollup, has updated its roadmap and goals for 2024. In a blog post, Base informed that it will not only focus on building a development platform but on fostering the decentralization of such an environment, building on-chain apps, and bringing liquidity to its ecosystem.
Base to Focus on Building a ‘New Economy’ in 2024
Base, the Coinbase incubated Ethereum rollup, has revealed an updated roadmap for 2024. The rollup indicated that it will now focus not only on building a “world-class on-chain development platform” but also on the apps that can be built on top of it and the capital that moves through them.
This commitment comes as part of the new conception of the Base ecosystem, which is now conceived as a three-layer platform, with an app ecosystem layer and a market layer on top of its development component. For this task, Base wants to establish itself as a rollup with a large capital component, coming from native and interconnected apps from Ethereum and other rollups.
With this new set of goals, Base aims to attract “over 1 billion people to a flourishing ecosystem of applications that enable the next wave of global creativity and innovation.”
Technically, this involves different sets of tasks, which include launching fault proofs to evolve to a Stage 1 rollup, the reduction of fees by the adoption of EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), advancing the adoption of ERC-4337 and smart wallets, improving the availability of Base’s on and offramps, and further integrating Base into Coinbase’s ecosystem.
On the human side, Base announced it will keep supporting developers with its Grants program and supporting gasless interactions and coding learning initiatives. According to L2beat, Base is currently the third rollup with most total value locked (TVL), with over $700 million in its network.
In September, Base grew to have a TVL of $370 million, overtaking Solana’s numbers at the time.
