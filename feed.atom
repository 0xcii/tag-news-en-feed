        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin dropped to its lowest level since January, as a red wave swept through cryptocurrency markets. The Silvergate bank based sell-off has impacted overall sentiment, with the global crypto market cap down 3.63% as of writing. Shiba inu also dropped, falling to a six-week low.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped to a multi-month low on Friday, as the Silvergate based sell-off has impacted overall sentiment in the marketplace.
 
Following a high of $0.08084 on Thursday, DOGE/USD fell to an intraday bottom at $0.07424 earlier today.
 
This sell-off has pushed the meme coin to its lowest point since January 9, and below a key support point in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, dogecoin briefly broke out of a floor at $0.0755, which came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also fell below its own support.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 34.80, which is a historically stable floor at the 40.00 mark.
 
Earlier declines have somewhat eased, and DOGE is trading at $0.07589 at the time of writing.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Additionally, shiba inu (SHIB) was another meme coin to edge lower in today’s session, falling to a six-week low in the process.
 
SHIB/USD slipped to a bottom at $0.00001104 on Friday, following Thursday’s peak at $0.00001219.
 
As a result, shiba inu fell below a floor at $0.00001130, hitting its weakest point since January 25 in the process.
 
 
Overall, SHIB is down 14% in the last seven days, which has resulted in the RSI falling to a two-month low.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 38.30, which is in bearish and oversold territory, and is its lowest reading since January 1.
 
Like with DOGE, bears have seemingly begun taking profits, which has resulted in a slight rebound from earlier lows.
