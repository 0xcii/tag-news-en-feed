Ethereum Open Interest Has Shot Up Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the ETH open interest has spiked as the cryptocurrency’s price has been declining, a pattern that has also been seen a few times in the past month.
 
The “open interest” here is an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of Ethereum futures market contracts that are currently open on all derivative exchanges. This metric naturally counts both long and short contracts.
 
When the value of this indicator goes up, it means that the futures market users are opening up more positions right now. Usually, whenever more positions appear, more leverage also em…]]></summary>

Regulatory Safety
According to a report by

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BitGo, a leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency custody firm, announced on Wednesday that it has successfully raised $100 million in its Series C financing round, bolstering its valuation to $1.75 billion. The funds will be allocated to amplify BitGo's secure and regulated custody, wallet, and infrastructure solutions on a global scale and to facilitate strategic acquisitions.



"Not only are we seeing growing demand for regulated custody solutions in the US, but we're also seeing the demand on a global scale," said BitGo CEO Mike Belshe. "We are very pleased to announce our $100M Series C for the purpose of meeting this growing need and to provide institutions, brands, coin foundations, and others with secure and seamless participation in the digital asset ecosystem."
Amid a dynamic market environment, BitGo has registered growth across the board since the beginning of the year. With a 60% surge in new client onboarding, a 20% increase in Asset Under Custody (AUC), a 200% upswing in fiat custody, and a 40-fold growth in staked assets. Notably, BitGo has distinguished itself as the entrusted custodian for the FTX creditors' funds under the leadership of John Ray III. Previously, the company was also selected as the distributor for the Mt. Gox creditors.
BitGo's recent funding success comes on the heels of the launch of its Go Network, empowering institutions to trade and settle both digital assets and fiat currencies round the clock from secure custody. With a robust presence as a premier regulated custodian in more than 50 countries, BitGo consistently handles an 20% of all on-chain Bitcoin transactions by value, according to the announcement.
Big name clients, such as Nike, have also chosen BitGo's secure and scalable wallet-as-a-service solution to navigate the intricate regulatory landscape.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The digital asset trust firm Bitgo, headquartered in Palo Alto, California, has secured $100 million in a Series C funding round. While the company remains tight-lipped about the participants in this financial endeavor, this fresh infusion of capital catapults the firm’s post-valuation to $1.75 billion.
 
Bitgo Raises $100 Million From Undisclosed Investors
 
Bitgo has successfully bagged $100 million in a Series C funding round, with the investors’ names under wraps, as per a Bloomberg report. Bitgo’s top executive, Mike Belshe, acknowledged the challenging market landscape. Yet, he emphasized the company’s commitment to licensing and regulatory measures, noting, “Regulatory safety is top-of-mind for everyone,” in a conversation with Bloomberg’s Hannah Miller.
 
This update comes on the heels of Galaxy Digital scrapping its intentions to snap up Bitgo for a cool $1.2 billion in August 2022. Earlier, in June, Bitgo had its eyes on the beleaguered crypto custodian, Prime Trust, with acquisition plans. However, the deal fell through. Prime Trust soon found itself filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the following month.
 
 
Though the Prime Trust deal went south, Belshe indicated to Miller that a portion of this fresh capital would fuel future acquisitions. He alluded to two potential buyouts already in the pipeline, as cited by Miller. While Bitgo remains mum on this round’s backers, past investors have featured big names like Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, Redpoint, Goldman Sachs, and DRW Holdings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An iconic Ordinal is being donated to the team that kickstarted the upstart protocol. 
Announced today, Bitcoin Magazine is gifting one of its 23 ‘Historic Covers,’ unique one-of-one Ordinals representing our print magazine’s original run, to the Open Ordinals Institute, a new non-profit dedicated to fostering development of the open-source Ordinals protocol. 
Launching at the beginning of August, the OOI is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization that plans to accept donations, including those in Ordinals, on behalf of the development team. 
This means that, a short few months after its debut, ‘Historic Ordinal #3’ is officially off the market. 
 
         
         
         
         
    
“We are proud that this prized collectible can give back to the team that has helped kickstart a new era of building on the Bitcoin blockchain,” said Namcios, Bitcoin Magazine Editor and project lead of its Ordinals OTC desk, Rare BTC. 
To date, Bitcoin Magazine’s Historic Covers have seen over 4.3 BTC in total volume, with our ‘Historic Cover #1’ selling for 1.25 BTC, worth over $30,000 at the time of sale. 
Since its January launch, the Ordinals protocol has caused no shortage of discussion in the Bitcoin community for its much-debated design trade-offs, most notably its ability to enable any arbitrary data to be stored in a bitcoin block and secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. 
Already, over 20 million ordinals have been minted using the protocol, a feat detractors say is bloating the blockchain. 
“We’re honored to receive one of the Bitcoin Magazine Historic Covers, a tangible piece of Bitcoin history,” said Erin Redwing, President of the Open Ordinals Institute. “As one of the first and most notable collections launched on the Ordinals protocol, these will stand the test of time. And how fitting that it’s a cover of the first Bitcoin ape!”
Bitcoin Magazine ‘Historic Covers’ are now for sale on popular secondary Ordinals markets, including Gamma and MagicEden.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI tokens have caught the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, as its chair, Gary Gensler, highlighted potential conflicts of interest within the realm of artificial intelligence. 
 
In a series of posts on the social network X, Gensler acknowledged the transformative power of AI while expressing caution about its misuse by “bad actors” to manipulate capital markets. 
 
The statements underscore the SEC’s commitment to ensuring impartiality in technology-related matters, focusing on outcomes rather than the tools themselves.
 
 
We @SECGov are technology neutral. We focus on the outcomes, rather than the tool itself. Securities laws, though, may be implicated depending upon how AI tech is used. Within our current authorities, we’re focused on protecting against both the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin dropped to a one-month low on Wednesday, as a red wave swept through cryptocurrency markets. Bearish sentiment remained high as the session progressed, with the global market cap falling by nearly 2% today. XRP also plunged in today’s session.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) fell for a fourth straight session, as bears continue to regain momentum, following last week’s gains.
 
After peaking at $0.07407 on Tuesday, DOGE/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.06893 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this fall in price, dogecoin slipped to its lowest level since July 19, when price was at a bottom of $0.0682.
 
 
The decline comes following a downward crossover of the moving averages, which is also known as a death cross.
 
This week’s bearish momentum intensified after DOGE moved below a support point at $0.0730.
 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) also edged lower, dropping to a reading of 39.10, its lowest in four weeks.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, also remained in the red on Wednesday, dropping to a multi-week low in the process.
 
XRP/USD bottomed out at $0.5918 earlier in today’s session, which comes following Tuesday’s high at $0.6275.
 
Similar to dogecoin above, today’s drop in price saw XRP move to its lowest point since mid-July.
 
 
One of the catalysts for the sell-off was a breakout of a support point at the 40.00 mark on the RSI indicator.
 
The index is now tracking at 36.76, which is its weakest point since May, a point when the price was hovering around $0.4600.
 
Bulls will hope to reject further drops in price, however will first need to drop below an upcoming floor at the 32.00 zone.
