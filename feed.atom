        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ltc-hits-2-week-high-as-ape-extends-gains/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-16T16:56:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin rose for a third consecutive session on Tuesday, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly falling lower. The global market cap is currently down by 1.28%, as overall market uncertainty remains high. Apecoin also rallied, extending recent gains.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was once again in the green, as the token rose for a third consecutive session.
 
LTC/USD surged to a peak of $89.68 in today’s session, after starting the week at a low at $86.42.
 
Tuesday’s rally has seen litecoin climb to its strongest point since April 30, which is the last time price was above $90.00.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that this level is once again the target for bulls, and could very likely be hit in the coming days.
 
After breaking out of a ceiling at 50.00, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 56.28.
 
The next visible point of resistance is now at the 59.00 mark, and should this be hit, not only will LTC be above $90.00, but likely closer to 92.00.
 
 
Apecoin (APE)
 
In addition to LTC, apecoin (APE) also surged on Tuesday, despite current market uncertainty.
 
Following a low of $3.33 to start the week, APE rose to an intraday high of $3.45 earlier in today’s session.
 
The gain comes as APE broke out of a ceiling at $3.35, resulting in price climbing to its highest point since May 8.
 
 
APE has fallen marginally lower from earlier highs, as its RSI failed to overcome a resistance point at 38.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is at the 37.69 mark, with the price now at $3.42.
 
If bulls are able to break this wall, then there is a good chance that APE could continue its move towards $4.00.

        <updated>2023-05-16T13:59:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin technology and financial services company, River, has announced a successful $35 million equity round in its Series B fundraising effort. Led by Kingsway Capital, the round also saw participation from notable investors such as Peter Thiel, Cygni, Goldcrest and Valor Equity Partners. The company provides a range of Bitcoin services, including zero-fee recurring orders, full-reserve custody, mining and a Bitcoin wallet that supports both on-chain and Lightning Network transactions.
Alex Leishman, the CEO of River, highlighted the growing interest in Bitcoin driven by business and institutional adoption. He emphasized the importance of Bitcoin as a secure path to a stronger and more transparent global economy, especially in light of recent bank failures and bailouts. Leishman stated, "Adopting Bitcoin with a trusted partner is no longer the speculative choice, but rather the prudent one."
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, River has experienced significant growth in demand for its enterprise Lightning API, River Lightning. This API enables companies to integrate with the Lightning Network and facilitate instant Bitcoin payments. Notably, El Salvador's Chivo wallet relies on River Lightning for Lightning transactions. The surge in demand for Lightning transactions, driven by rising on-chain fees, has prompted River to expand its B2B River Lightning segment.
Leishman emphasized River's commitment to responsible and reliable practices, setting the company apart from others in the crypto industry. He noted, "We have not taken shortcuts or reckless risks with our regulatory strategy and product offering. We're a mission-driven company with full-reserve Bitcoin custody, and will continue to play our part in moving society towards a brighter economic future powered by Bitcoin."]]></summary>

Following two months of declines, sales in the United States are expected to rebound, as inflation cools off. Ethereum remains above the $1,800 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated in today’s session, as markets were preparing for the release of the latest U.S. retail sales figures.
 
As inflation falls, sales for April are expected to rise by 0.8%, following two consecutive months of declines.
 
Following an earlier high of $27,646.35, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $26,878.95 on Tuesday.
 
 
Price has since rebounded, and at the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $27,097.23.
 
A failed breakout of the 42.00 mark on the relative strength index (RSI) appears to have played a pivotal role in today’s decline.
 
The index is now tracking at 41.06, with a floor at 38.00 a potential target, should momentum continue to depreciate.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Despite a brief breakout below the $1,800 level, ethereum (ETH) was largely stable on Tuesday.
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,845.70 earlier in the day, which follows on from a bottom at $1,797.84 to start the week.
 
The world’s second largest cryptocurrency has since declined, and at the time of writing is trading at $1,817.12.
 
 
This is close to a price floor at $1,820, which has been in place since last Wednesday, when price was on day five of a six-day losing streak.
 
Price strength has also contributed to the current volatility. Similar to BTC, the index is hovering below a key resistance level.
 
Should it move beyond a reading of 45.00, there is a good chance that the ETH bulls will make another run for the $1,900 level.
