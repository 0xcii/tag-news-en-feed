Swiss-based non-custodial bitcoin-exchange Pocket Bitcoin has acquired popular bitcoin wallet app Bitkipi, the company announced on Monday. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the acquisition will help Pocket Bitcoin solidify its focus on self-custody and provide users with a platform for buying and holding bitcoin in their own wallets. Previously, customers could set up Pocket with their own existing wallets via the company’s website and stack bitcoin using simple bank transfers.
"We believe that everyone should have access to the financial freedom that bitcoin provides, and the Bitkipi app will be instrumental in helping us achieve that goal," said David Knezić, CEO and co-founder of Pocket Bitcoin. “With this acquisition, Pocket Bitcoin now has an in-house wallet app that enables beginners to easily get started with bitcoin and self-custody,” the press release describes.
Bitkipi's founder expressed excitement to join forces with Pocket Bitcoin and bring their vision to life. "We have been working hard to create an easy-to-use, secure, and reliable bitcoin-only wallet app that can help newcomers get started with bitcoin," said the founder of Bitkipi. The app will continue to be available on both the App Store and Google Play, and current users can expect to see continued updates.
According to the press release, in almost two years, PocketBitcoin has already exchanged over ~$54 million (€50 million) in bitcoin for customers from all over Europe and paid them out on self-custodial wallets.

Where Bitcoin is seeing single-digit gains on its daily and weekly chart, these DeFi tokens are returning double-digit gains for their investors.
 
Stacks (STX)
 
Stacks (STX) is a DeFi token that made it into the limelight with the introduction of the Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs. These NFTs quickly grew in popularity and the price of STX rose as Bitcoin Taproot saw more adoption. Over the last few months, STX has put up an impressive rally and even now, the digital asset has not let up.
 
 
While BTC is seeing around 6% gains in the last day, STX is up over 11%. This recovery has put the digital asset’s price above $0.…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-04-11T12:29:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved above $30,000 on April 11, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. Markets surged after data in China showed that consumer prices had hit an 18-month low. Ethereum was also higher on the news, moving closer to $2,000. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) raced above $30,000 for the first time in ten months, as markets reacted to the latest inflation data from China.
 
Consumer prices in China rose by 0.7% in March, which is the slowest increase since September 2021.
 
Following a low of $28,189.27 to start the week, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $30,160.48 earlier today.
 
 
This move saw bitcoin climb to its strongest point since June 9, and comes as the 10-day (red) moving average avoided a downward cross with its 24-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) moved above a key resistance point of 68.00, and is currently tracking at 71.05.
 
The next visible ceiling appears to be at the 73.00 mark, and as a result, bulls may begin to secure profits, slowly vacating earlier positions.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also back in the green on Tuesday, with prices once again trading above $1,900.
 
ETH/USD hit a peak of $1,936.73 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,848.16.
 
As a result of Tuesday’s surge in price, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency neared its highest point since last August.
 
Looking at the chart, today’s move coincided with the RSI breaking out of a ceiling at the 61.00 mark.
 
 
At the time of writing, price strength is at a reading of 64.04, with an upcoming resistance point at 65.00.
 
Should ETH move beyond this point, there is a good chance that ETH will move back above $2,000.

And while its recent performance hasn’t been particularly outstanding, with a 1.7% increase in the past 24 hours and a 1.2% decrease in the last seven days, the current price of Shiba Inu at $0.00001113, according to Coingecko, still has the potential to attract attention.
 

 
 
But what is driving the rising futures open interest on SHIB, and what does this mean for the future of this cryptocurrency?
