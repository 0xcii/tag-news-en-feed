        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data shows the American exchanges are observing a rise in their Bitcoin dominance. Here’s what happened the last two times this trend appeared.
 
Bitcoin Is Moving From Global Platforms To US-Based Ones
 
In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has discussed a trend that has been emerging in a Bitcoin indicator recently. The metric in question is the ratio between the BTC reserve of US-based platforms and off-shore ones.
 
 
“Platforms” here not only include the exchanges, but also the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were only approved to operate in the US in January of this year.
