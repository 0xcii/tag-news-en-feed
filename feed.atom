        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Monday, Morgan Stanley’s equity strategist, Michael Wilson, shared his thoughts on the state of Wall Street. He expressed his belief that a sell-off could be imminent, and that this could occur as a result of U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell’s upcoming remarks on Wednesday. Furthermore, there has been a great deal of conjecture surrounding the possibility of the central bank cutting the federal funds rate multiple times throughout the year. However, Wilson believes that investors who are expecting this outcome will ultimately be disappointed.

        <updated>2023-05-02T13:11:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below the $28,000 level on Tuesday, as markets continued to prepare for tomorrow’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision. The Fed is expected to increase rates by 0.25%, despite the U.S. economy slowing down. Ethereum also remained lower, moving close to a breakout below $1,800. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $28,000 on Tuesday, as markets prepared for the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision.
 
BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $27,680.79 earlier in today’s session, which came less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $28,626.28.
 
As a result of this move, bitcoin nearly collided with its recent price floor at $27,600, hitting a six-day low in the process.
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
Looking at the chart, the latest decline comes as the relative strength index (RSI) moved below a floor of its own at 50.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 46.17, with the next visible point of support at 43.00.
 
Bitcoin has since moved back above $28,000, and is currently trading at $28,176.91.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also lower in today’s session, with prices also falling to a key level of support.
 
Following a high of $1,851.19 to start the week, ETH/USD plunged to a bottom at $1,809.19 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s drop saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency move below its long-term price floor at $1,830.
 
 
 
 
 

ETH has since rebounded from this floor, as sentiment remained relatively stable, despite the earlier decline.
 
 
 
This happened despite the RSI trading under a support point of its own at 45.00, with a current reading of 44.30.
 
There could be more moves on Wednesday following the Fed decision, with a potential move above $1,900 still on the cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A prominent Australian cryptocurrency exchange, CoinJar, wants to launch into the United States market. From every indication, Coinjar seems undeterred by the cloudy crypto legislative atmosphere and regulatory risks.
 
CoinJar recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, and the CEO and co-founder, Asher Tan, made a remarkable comment. According to the CEO, CoinJar sees an opportunity in the US market where others see regulatory risk.
 
CoinJar Only Sees Opportunity in US Harsh Regulatory Atmosphere
 
CoinJar has been in business since 2013 when Bitcoin was relatively unknown to many. The platform has demonstrated high resilience, surviving several ups and downs in the crypto ecosystem.

This is an opinion editorial by Level39, a researcher focused on Bitcoin, technology, history, ethics and energy.
Does one of the largest individual shareholders of The New York Times benefit from the publication’s recent hit piece on Bitcoin mining? 
The article, "The Real-World Costs Of The Digital Race For Bitcoin," attacked the role of Bitcoin miners who participate in sanctioned demand-response programs within the Electricity Reliability Council Of Texas (ERCOT), the state’s energy grid.

Most of the digital asset’s reaction has been toward the FOMC meeting that will hold on May 2-3, at the end of which the CPI data will be released. As has been the case with the previous FOMC meetings, the price of Bitcoin has recoiled as investors await the Fed’s announcement.
 
Bitcoin Underperforms Ahead Of FOMC Meeting
 
Bitcoin saw a rocky start to the week as the digital asset’s price fell to the $27,000 level once more. There has been some recovery since then but it has not been significant by any stretch. Furthermore, bulls are having a hard time holding on to the support at $28,000 with this being a seller’s market. As a result, BTC is now looking toward support at a much lower level.

And the bankruptcy of First Republic Bank and its state-sponsored takeover by JP Morgan reinforces the case for Bitcoin once again.
 
At least that’s the thesis of Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, and he’s not alone. Via Twitter, Hayes wrote: “This JPM / FRC deal means the US regulators decided to nationalize the banking system.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's no doubt that the SEC dealt Kraken—and the outlook for crypto staking products in the U.S.—a big blow when it announced a $30 million settlement and ordered the company to stop offering the service to its customers in the states in February. Now Marco Santori, the company's chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
