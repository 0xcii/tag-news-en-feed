Gemini Co-Founder on Next Crypto Bull Run
 
Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, believes that the next crypto bull run will come from the East. He tweeted Sunday:
 

My working thesis [at the moment] is that the next bull run is going to start in the East. It will be a humbling reminder that crypto is a global asset class.
 
“The West, really the U.S., always only ever had two options: embrace it or be left behind. It can’t be stopped. That we know,” he emphasized.

Instead, Ethereum’s dominance could be in “grave” danger, if an ominous-sounding Japanese candlestick pattern is a prelude of what’s to come across the crypto market. 
 
Lagging Performance Against Crypto Leaves ETH.D Exposed To Danger
 
While Ethereum might be up by 90% from its bear market low compared to Bitcoin’s 50%, when comparing year-to-date returns BTC’s 50% gain against USD beats ETH’s mere 40%. From this metric alone, it’s obvious that Ethereum has been lagging behind Bitcoin.

Galois joins the ranks of BlockFi, Sequoia Capital, Genesis and other firms that have been caught in the FTX crossfire.
 
It takes time for dominos to fall, and despite FTX’s collapse being nearly 4 months in the making, Galois’ collapse is not a surprise for some. Let’s review what’s been revealed in the early stages of the firm’s shutdown.
 
Early Stages: What We Know So Far 
It’s a large fall from grace from what was one of crypto’s largest hedge funds; Galois at one point managed nearly a quarter of a billion dollars worth of assets at it’s peak. In November, immediately following FTX’s fall, it was largely believed that G…]]></summary>

Crypto Hedge Fund Shuts Down Due to FTX Collapse

The metric accounts for both the senders and receivers and counts unique addresses. It means that if an address has made multiple transactions throughout the day, it will still be included only once.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana rose by as much as 11% to start the week, as the token moved higher for a fourth consecutive session. Market sentiment has mostly been bullish in the past two weeks, leading to prices hitting a multi-month high on Monday. Bitcoin cash also surged, climbing to its strongest level since July.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rose by over 11% in Monday’s session, as the token raced to a multi-month high earlier in the day.
 
Following a low of $24.04 on Sunday, SOL/USD surged to an intraday peak of $26.93 to start the week.
 
As a result of this move, solana climbed to its highest level since November 8, when price hit a high of $31.78.
 
 
This is the fourth straight session that solana has risen, with prices breaking out of a key resistance level of $26.00 in the process.
 
In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has moved beyond a ceiling of its own at 62.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 63.58, and should it continue in this upward direction, SOL could hit $30.00 in the coming days.
 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Another notable gainer on Monday has been bitcoin cash (BCH), which also moved to its highest point in the past several months..
 
BCH/USD raced to a high of $146.83 earlier in the day, which comes after trading at a bottom of $134.55 on Sunday.
 
The rally took bitcoin cash to a point not seen since July 31, when the cryptocurrency traded above $150.00.
 
 
This comes as the 10-day (red) moving average nears a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Additionally, the RSI has also moved to a 16-day high, and is tracking at 65.85, which is near a ceiling of 66.00.
 
Should price strength pass this hurdle, then BCH bulls will likely recapture the $150.00 mark.

This is an opinion editorial by Jimmy Song, a Bitcoin developer, educator and entrepreneur and programmer with over 20 years of experience.
In the last essay, I covered how fiat money ruins individual incentives. The lack of savings vehicles and the availability of debt create a potent mix of terrible incentives at the individual level. Lack of savings vehicles mean that individuals have to work to keep any value they have and the availability of debt means that they can bring forward a lot of consumption.
The result is a lot of people who consume and relatively few productive people who save.
