        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/el-salvadors-assembly-approves-bitcoin-bonds-bill"/>
        <updated>2023-01-11T20:56:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The country’s legislative body has completed the next step towards the issuance of El Salvador’s bitcoin bonds.
El Salvador has voted to pass a bill which paves the way for the issuing of President Nayib Bukele’s bitcoin bonds. 
The plan, which was announced in November 2021, would entail El Salvador issuing $1 billion in bonds on Blockstream's Liquid Network, a federated Bitcoin sidechain. The goal of the bond issuance would be to invest half of the money into bitcoin, and the other half into infrastructure necessary to build out the bitcoin industry in the Central American country. The bonds, according to the statement at the time, would yield 6.5% and enable a fast-track for investors to acquire citizenship in the country. 
Exactly one year after the announcement of the plan, the bill that was voted on today was introduced by El Salvador’s Minister of the Economy Maria Luisa Hayem Brevé to the country’s legislative assembly as the next step towards this plan. With today’s approval, the country is much closer to making the bitcoin bonds a reality.

El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office released a statement in response to the vote that read in part, “Today El Salvador builds on our first-mover advantage by passing landmark legislation establishing a legal framework for all digital assets that are not bitcoin. The law also paves the way for the volcano bonds which we will soon begin issuing.” 
In a statement to Bitcoin Magazine, Max Keiser, a Bitcoin educator and advocate who has also been a major proponent for El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin since the process began, states that he believes “This is one of the most important milestones yet. Making Bitcoin legal tender in September, 2021 put El Salvador on the global financial map. This new law furthers the mission of President Bukele by establishing a foundation for a new global, digital securities layer built on Bitcoin.”]]></summary>

Hashrate Index has released its 2022 Bitcoin Mining Year In Review, an extensive report on the mining industry and markets surrounding it. 

2022 was a difficult year for Bitcoin mining, with the bear market leading to a hashprice all-time low, bankruptcies and losses for miners. Despite this, hash rate still grew 41%, and Bitcoin mining still generated nearly double the rewards compared to the previous three years. The report covers all of these topics and more in detail.
One of the main focuses of the report is the growth of hash rate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, a counsel for the bankrupt crypto trading venue FTX, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, stated that the company recovered more than $5 billion. However, the magnitude of consumer losses in its collapse was still unknown.
 
U.S. authorities have accused Bankman-Fried of organizing an “epic” scam that may have cost investors, clients, and lenders billions of dollars; the company’s valuation was $32 billion a year ago, but it filed for bankruptcy in November.
 
 
Andy Dietderich, an attorney for the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, says that the company has “recovered $5 billion in cash and liquid coins.” The full extent of the exchange’s client deficit is “still unclear” as they continue “working to rebuild transaction histories.”

Large Cap And Small Cap Altcoins Saw Flat Returns In The Past Month
 
According to the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, several alts have seen large short squeezes in recent days. The “altcoin indexes” here refer to groups of coins clubbed together on the criteria of market cap. The benefit of these indexes is that the performance of the different market sectors can be easily tracked using them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the FTX bankruptcy case and fraud charges against co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried continue to unfold, the value of the exchange’s token, FTX Token (FTT), has seen significant growth. Since Jan. 9, 2023, FTT has risen 28.42% and currently sits above the $1 range, following a dip below that threshold.
 
FTT Token Jumps 28% Rising Above the $1 Threshold
 
The value of FTX’s exchange token, FTT, has seen a marked increase over the past two days. On Jan. 9, 2023, the coin reached $1.36 per unit. While some of those gains have been lost, FTT is currently holding above the $1 range at $1.22 per coin as of 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 11, 2023. The reason for this surge in value is uncertain, as FTT’s tokenomics are tied to the now-defunct FTX exchange and its potential future growth.
