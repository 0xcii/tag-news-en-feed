The survey exposed a possible change in the political scene as the 2024 elections draws near. According to the June poll of 1,025 Republican voters, nearly 30% of them had made cryptocurrency investments.
 
The results of the poll imply that the Republican Party is seeing cryptocurrencies as a major issue more and more that fits its principles of financial independence and little government intrusion. Therefore, the junction of digital money with conservative ideas might be rather important in determining the party’s policies and voter outreach campaigns in the next elections.
