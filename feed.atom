The DOJ is now working on a plan to seize Robinhood Markets shares related with Sam Bankman-Fried, who was the founder and former chief executive officer of FTX.
 
These shares in contention are valued at around $465 million.
 
FTX creditors have launched judicial actions in an attempt to recover the shares. DOJ attorney Seth B. Shapiro stated that a court hearing will be scheduled to decide the disposition of the seized Robinhood shares and bank account assets.
 
The allegations that Bankman-Fried cheated consumers and investors have been officially refuted by him.

Shiba Inu Has Enjoyed Uptrend In The Past Day, While Solana Declines
 
2022 was an abysmal year for both Shiba Inu and Solana, as the cryptos both saw drawdowns of more than 70% in the year, with SOL being especially deeper into loss. 2023 has, however, been kinder to these coins as they are both in the green so far.

Bitcoin (BTC) mostly consolidated on Thursday, as price failed to break out of the key level of $17,000 yesterday.
 
Following a high of $16,964.59 on hump day, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $16,789.75 earlier in the session.
 
The drop comes as markets reacted to the latest FOMC minutes, where the Fed have seemingly agreed to maintain interest rate hikes.

Can Bitcoin ‘Detect’ Imbeciles?
 
Fast forward to 2023, Taleb revealed his opinions on Bitcoin once more, and he now has a new moniker for the cryptocurrency: Detector of imbeciles.
 
Taleb claimed in a recent interview with L’Express that the cryptocurrency industry and a portion of the technology will soon become extinct when the era of “low-interest rate ‘Disneyland'” comes to an end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a year that was characterized by surging energy and food prices, Germany’s average inflation rate in 2022 rose to 7.9% up from the 3.1% seen in 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the supply bottlenecks resulting from the war, are said to be among the factors that helped to drive up prices. 
 
Impact of the Ukraine-Russia War
 
In 2022, Germany’s average inflation rate topped 7.9%, its highest since the 1990 reunification, the country’s statistical office has said. As per the German press agency’s Jan. 3 report, the 2022 rate is more than double the 3.1% seen in 2021.
 
According to the report, rising energy and food prices were among the main drivers of inflation for several months. As expected, the German Federal Statistical Office (FSO) reportedly identified Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the ensuing supply bottlenecks, as two key factors that led to the record inflation rate.
 
“Consumers in Germany had to pay 24.4% more for energy in December than a year earlier. Food prices rose by 20.7% within a year,” the agency’s report explained.
 

 
Germany’s Monthly Inflation Slowing Down
 
Despite recording what has been described as the country’s worst overall inflation rate since the 7.6% seen in 1951, the FSO data suggest that the monthly rate had dropped to 8.6% in December 2022. Before that, the rate had averaged 10.4% and 10%, in October and November, respectively.
 
To minimize the impact of rising prices on the population, the German government is reportedly planning to pour out “billions in aid.” It also aims to achieve this by using “price brakes for electricity and gas.” According to the report, some economists are optimistic that such steps will help tame inflation in 2023.
