Bitcoin Futures Market May Be Becoming Overheated
 
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC open interest has entered the overheat zone following the latest rally in the cryptocurrency’s price.
 
The “open interest” here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts open on all derivative exchanges in the sector. The metric naturally accounts for both short and long positions.
 
When the value of this indicator rises, it means that the investors are opening up more positions on the futures market right now. Generally, whenever this happens, the overall leverage in the market also goes up, and with leverage,…]]></summary>

Bitcoin went through the blocksize war. A nation state has adopted Bitcoin. We are possibly on the verge of a Bitcoin ETF approval. Bitcoin in almost every way is nothing like it was described in the original whitepaper all the years ago. 
The network has grown, it has changed, it has evolved. On a social level, an economic level, and a technical level it's a completely different animal than it was all those many years ago. I feel like on this day, every year, people tend to focus on Bitcoin as it was all the way back in 2008. People get nostalgic about the basic design with no mention of mining pools, or ASICs, or second layer protocols. This year I wanted to do som…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was one of the biggest gainers on Tuesday, as price rose by as much as 8% in today’s session. The surge pushed the token to its strongest level since the middle of August, and closer to a key resistance zone. Toncoin was another notable gainer, climbing by over 6% today.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was a strong gainer on Tuesday, as the token rose by as much as 8% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $0.5634 to start the week, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.6127 earlier today.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, the world’s fifth largest cryptocurrency rose to its highest level since August 15.
 
 
Today’s move saw XRP climb for a third straight day, pushing the token close to a ceiling of $0.6400.
 
From the chart, it appears that the relative strength index (RSI) has broken a resistance point of 73.00, and is now sitting at 75.08.
 
In order to reach the aforementioned resistance level, the index will likely need to reach a ceiling at or above 80.00.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was another notable gainer on Tuesday, climbing to a one-month high during the day.
 
TON/USD hit a high of $2.23 earlier in the day, which comes a day after trading at a low of $2.09.
 
Owing to the move, toncoin rose to its highest point since September 28, when price was above $2.30.
 
 
Looking at the chart, recent gains have pushed price strength above a ceiling at 59.00, and the index is now tracking at 61.62.
 
The next visible point of resistance is at the 71.00 point, and if hit, there is a good chance TON moves towards $2.60.

This time, he and his lawyers seemed solely focused on changing the narrative that had already been put forward by the prosecution, including certain correspondences between Bankman-Fried and FTX’s former Director of Engineering Nishad Singh.
 
FTX Founder Says Messages To Singh Were Misunderstood
 
According to a report by Fortune, Bankman-Fried stated that Singh misinterpreted the text exchanges between them just before FTX filed for bankruptcy. In one of the exchanges, Singh had asked SBF if he was fine with him performing some backdated trades in order to get rid of his debts, as …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to trade under the $35,000 level on Tuesday, as markets prepared for the upcoming U.S. consumer confidence report. It is expected that the confidence index will come in at a reading of 100 in October, down from 103 the month prior. Ethereum remains above $1,800.
 
Bitcoin
 

 
Bitcoin consolidated on Tuesday, as markets braced themselves for the upcoming consumer confidence report from the United States.
 

 
Following a high of $34,843.94 to start the week, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $34,083.31 in today’s session.
 

 
This has resulted in the world’s largest cryptocurrency hovering below a key price point of $35,000.
 

 

 

 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) tracked above a floor at 79.00, which is deep in bull territory.
 

 
Price strength is now sitting at 82.02, with the next visible point of resistance being at the 88.00 mark.
 

 
Overall, many see BTC as being overcooked, with a more long-lasting reversal potentially on the cards.
 

 

 
Ethereum
 

 
Ethereum (ETH) continued to hover around the $1,800 level, despite a slight stint below this point during today’s session.
 

 
ETH/USD fell to a low of $1,784.95 earlier in the day, which came following a peak at $1,829.25 on Monday.
 

 
Bulls have since bought this earlier dip, pushing ethereum to a current reading around the $1,813.25 region.
 

 

 

 
From the chart, it appears that the rally came as the RSI bounced from 68.00. It is now tracking at 71.65.
 

 
A ceiling at 75.00 now awaits traders, and should strength move beyond this, ETH will likely move closer to $1,900.
