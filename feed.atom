        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As meme coins recovered from their 2023 lows, expectations for coins like Shiba Inu are rising, with price targets being set for $0.0001. Reaching this price level would be a new all-time high for SHIB, but there are a number of factors that will drive the growth needed to reach it.
 
Shiba Inu Needs Demand
 
The Shiba Inu price, as with other cryptocurrencies, is highly dependent on the demand to supply ratio. When there is more supply than demand, the price tends to suffer. However, when demand surpasses supply, it leads to a surge in price, which is why demand for the SHIB token is important.
 
 
Some indicators of rising demand include a rise in the trading volume and in the last 24 hours, the SHIB daily trading volume is up over 33% to reach $2.1 billion. There has also been an increa…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Approaching “Danger Zone”
 
According to price charts, Bitcoin is trading above $72,400 when writing. However, as time progresses, the coin is inching closer to the “Danger Zone.” Usually, when prices are at this region, as past price action shows, the coin tends to pull back sharply, unwinding gains. This area is time-based and takes place roughly two to four weeks before halving. 
 
 
The network will halve its miner rewards in roughly 33 days in mid-April 2024. Therefore, if past price action guides, it is likely that the expecte…]]></summary>
