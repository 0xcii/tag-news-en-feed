The company announced that it has been registered as a restricted dealer in Ontario under the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) oversight, a collective body of provincial and territorial securities regulators in Canada. 
 
This regulatory victory gives Coinbase the legal authority to conduct crypto asset transactions while meeting the requirements set forth by Canadian regulators.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has reiterated his stance on the future outlook of the meme cryptocurrency. According to him, DOGE’s recent price action has largely mirrored the 2018-2021 pattern. Particularly, the crypto cemented a break out from a descending pattern and has now formed a bullish fractal that could push it into a massive parabolic bull run.
