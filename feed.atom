Crypto Expert Believes XRP Price Is Suppressed
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, pro-XRP crypto YouTuber Jerry Hall stated that he believes that the price of the token has been suppressed for years. He noted that the moment he began to have this belief was when he realized that Ripple was selling into the market on a monthly basis. 
 
 
According to him, the fact that Ripple does this to finance their business shows that he and the company have different goals. He also seemed to suggest that Ripple didn’t care about XRP holders as he stated that “bag holders are …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent court ruling has granted FTX permission to  
sell approximately $873 million worth of assets held in trust. Around $700  
million of these assets are from Grayscale's primary offering, the Grayscale  
Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). 
The approval, dated November 29 and issued by a  
 bankruptcy court in Delaware, enables the defunct crypto exchange to liquidate  
holdings in trusts managed by Grayscale Investments and Bitwise. It marks a  
significant step in repaying creditors impacted by the collapse of the  
exchange.
The authorization was prompted by a motion filed by  
FTX's debtors on November 3, requesting the sale of six cryptocurrency trusts,  
including the GBTC, Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE),  
and Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Sitting Just Below Extreme Greed Right Now
 
The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator that tells us about the sentiment shared by the majority of the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency sector.
 
According to Alternative, its creator, the index takes into account these factors when calculating the mentality: volatility, market volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends.
 
 
The Fear & Greed Index uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100 to denote the sentiment. Values of the metric above the 54 mark suggest greed among traders, while those below 46 imply the presence o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The regulatory struggles of crypto are evident. Despite the growing adoption of digital assets across almost every industry, there has been a significant lack of regulatory clarity. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has relentlessly pursued restrictive regulation on crypto for the past few years. 
Although Ripple and Grayscale secured milestone victories over the SEC in October, regulators continue to scrutinize centralized exchanges and traditional institutes that support digital asset integration, and the latest legal drama involving Binance precisely proved this tendency. 
 The UK has recently seen how the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) strict rules on crypto marketing have forced many growing businesses, such as Binance, to either rethink or cease their opera…]]></summary>

Since then, they have consistently added to their Bitcoin holdings, creating a treasury reserve strategy that has garnered over 174,530 bitcoin worth more than $6.59 billion at the time of writing.
“On November 30, 2023, MicroStrategy announced that, during the period between November 1, 2023 and November 29, 2023, MicroStrategy, together with its subsidiaries, acquired approximately 16,130 bitcoins for approximately $593.3 million in cash, at an average price of approximately $36,785 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses,” MicroStrategy stated. “As of November 29, 2023, MicroStrategy, together with its subsidiaries, held an aggregate of approximately 174,530 bitcoins, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.280 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $30,252 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.”

At least that was the takeaway from capital allocator Anthony Scaramucci's most recent visit to crypto industry podcast "The Scoop." 
In the interview, Scaramucci talked at length about how a Bitcoin ETF is poised to reshape the investing landscape. In particular, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, declared that an ETF "approved by the federal government" would unleash a salesforce tsunami, channeling billions into the cryptocurrency.
Scaramucci, a Wall Street veteran, underscored the strategic shift, stating, "There's this unspoken not-so-secret reality of Wall Street: products are sold, not bought."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a claim from an individual asserting they had lost 139 bitcoin in a hack, where 83.65 BTC was utilized as a heightened fee to expedite its mining, Antpool has disclosed its readiness to reimburse the mistakenly paid fee. Antpool specified on November 30 that the individual has a deadline of December 10, 2023, to reclaim the fee from the mining pool. 
 
Deadline Announced by Antpool for Refunding Massive Bitcoin Transaction Fee in Suspected Hack Case
 
Recently, the cryptocurrency community observed an exceptionally large transaction fee, where 83.65 BTC, valued at over $3 million, was remitted to miners. This transaction, confirmed in block 818,087, was processed by Antpool, today’s most dominant mining pool by hashrate. Following this event, an unidentified user on the social media platform X disclosed that this fee originated from their bitcoin holdings, which were allegedly compromised by hackers.
 
The user also provided a signature, verifying their claim by signing a message with the private keys of the address. On November 30, Antpool issued a statement regarding the erroneously paid fee, declaring its readiness to refund the owner of the address. “On November 23rd, some user submitted 83 BTC as a gas fee,” Antpool disclosed. “The risk control system of Antpool temporarily froze the fee when packaging the transaction.”
 

Please contact us before 00:00 (UTC+8) on December 10, 2023 and verify personal identity in the following way. After verification, Antpool will refund the fee.
 
 
Confirming the user’s identity could be crucial for Antpool, as there’s a prevailing notion that the hacker might still possess the key, and the alleged victim might actually be the perpetrator. The user is required to sign the address and forward it to Antpool’s email for verification purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dunamu, the operator of the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit, recently said it had realized an operating profit amounting to $79 million in the third quarter of 2023. Virtual asset valuation losses contributed to the 81.6% drop in the operator’s net profit for the period. 
 
Operating Profit Down by Nearly 40%
 
In the third quarter (Q3) of 2023, Dunamu, the operator of the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit, reportedly realized an operating profit of just over $79 million (101.8 billion won). According to a Decenter report, Dunamu’s Q3 operating profit is nearly 40% lower than the $130.9 million realized in the corresponding period in 2022.
 
Similarly, Dunamu’s Q3 revenue, which stood at approximately $150 million, is 29% lower than the $211 million realized in the same period last year. Also, the crypto exchange operator’s Q3 net profit of $22.9 million is reportedly 81.6% lower than in the same period last year.
 

 
As per the report, Dunamu’s net profit for the period is lower due to so-called virtual asset valuation losses.
 
Meanwhile, the report revealed that Dunamu is now working on finding ways to mitigate the effects of the recession in the virtual assets market. An unnamed company official suggested that Dunamu is hoping to achieve this by pursuing new business opportunities.
 
“We will strive to revitalize the blockchain ecosystem and create an advanced investment environment, and do our best to provide innovative services based on Dunamu’s unique technological capabilities,” the unnamed official said.
