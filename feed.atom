        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar have a long-standing inverse correlation, notably when observing the Dollar Strength Index (DXY). When the dollar weakens, Bitcoin often gains strength, and this dynamic might now be setting the stage for restarting the BTC bull cycle.
DXY
The Dollar Strength Index (DXY) measures the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of other major global currencies. Historically, a declining DXY has often coincided with significant rallies in Bitcoin's price. Conversely, when the DXY is on the rise, Bitcoin tends to enter a bearish phase.

In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has recently discussed the trend in the Binance Funding Rate for a few different altcoins.
 
 
The “Funding Rate” is an indicator that keeps track of the periodic amount of fees that the traders on a given derivatives exchange (which, in the current case, is Binance) are exchanging between each other.
 
When the metric has a positive value, it means the long contract holders are paying a premium to the short investors to hold onto their positions right now. Such a trend implies a bullish mentality is the dominant one in the market.
