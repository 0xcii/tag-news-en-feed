traditional finance converge to create social and economic transformation.  
Where barriers to entry once stood, technological advancements are making it  
possible for anyone to access wealth-creation opportunities that were once the  
domain of the elite few. At the forefront of this transformation is the  
emergence of tokens, specifically those that represent real-world assets, such

By reimagining ownership and trading of assets, tokenization

As Bitcoiners around the world gather to celebrate block 840,000, miners are hunkering down and preparing for their reward for mining blocks to decrease by 50%, while the cost of their operations remains the same.
With the next bitcoin halving scheduled to occur on April 19, one might imagine that Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining company in the world, might be worried. But after sitting down with Thiel just days before the halving, he doesn’t appear to be breaking a sweat.
