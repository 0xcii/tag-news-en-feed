        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has provided insights into when the Spot Ethereum ETFs could begin trading if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were to approve these funds. Based on his remarks, it could take weeks to months before these funds launch, even if an approval would come this week. 
 
S-1 Filings Need To Be Approved Before Trading Can Commence 
 
Seyffart mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the S-1 approvals are needed before the Spot Ethereum ETFs can go live and that it could take “weeks to months” for this approval to come in. He made this statement while clarifying that their 75% approval odds only related to the deadline for the 19b-4 filings, with VanEck’s and Ark 21Shares’ final deadline coming up on May 23 and 24, respectively.
