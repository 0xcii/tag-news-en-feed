Since March 16, the wallet’s inflow chart shows the daily constant addition of each Bitcoin. Just a few hours ago, the most recent purchase took place, costing $60,500. Still, there have been several much smaller transactions in which the wallet obtained fractions of Bitcoin for less than $100.

However, recent market turbulence has put DOGE in a difficult spot, causing it to struggle with maintaining stable upward trends. Despite a brief rally on August 20th, where Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a 6% rise and an increase in trading volume, the momentum quickly fizzled out, leaving many investors looking elsewhere for more consistent gains.
 
As Dogecoin (DOGE) faces these challenges, a new wave of interest is brewing among crypto whales and early investors who are eyeing a fresh opportunity Mpeppe (MPEPE).

This metric measures the difference between Bitcoin's market cap and its realized cap, or cost-basis for all circulating BTC, helping investors determine whether Bitcoin is over or undervalued according to this ‘fundamental’ cost of BTC.
