        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. ZKSwap, the decentralized exchange operating within the ZKBase ecosystem, is pleased to announce its endorsement of the community-driven Layer2 network, ZKFair. Additionally, the platform has initiated the provision of initial liquidity on the ZKFair network. The newly introduced trading pairs on ZKFair include ZKB/USDT, ZKB/ETH, and ZKB/WBTC, collectively accounting for an approximate total liquidity of $2 million.
 
Established on February 14, 2021, ZKSwap has undergone progressive iterations with the introduction of V1, V2, and V3. As the pioneering Layer2 decentralized exchange utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, ZKSwap has committed approximately $30 million towards Layer2 network verification fees on the Ethereum network. At its zenith, the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the ZKSwap network surpassed $2 billion.
 
Presently, ZKSwap extends support to three Layer2 networks: zkSync Era, ZKFair, and ZKSpace. Notably, ZKSpace is slated for an imminent upgrade to the zkSync Era version. Furthermore, ZKSwap is gearing up to broaden its ecosystem by incorporating support for the Bitcoin network and introducing a BRC20 Swap product in the near future.
