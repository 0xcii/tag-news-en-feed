        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a three-day losing streak, bitcoin rebounded on Tuesday, ahead of the upcoming consumer confidence report in the United States. Price briefly fell below the $30,000 level earlier in the session, however bullish momentum has since returned. Ethereum rose above $1,900 for a short period.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded from recent losses on Tuesday, ahead of the upcoming U.S. consumer confidence report.
 
The Conference Board expects its index to rise to a reading of 104.0 in June, up from 102.3 the month prior.
 
BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $30,751.19 on Tuesday, following a low at $29,955.74 to start the week.
 
 
The move appears to have occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a support point at 68.00.
 
As of writing, the index now sits at a reading of 70.17, which is once again in overbought territory.
 
A barrier at 73.00 is now the next visible ceiling, and unless bulls break out of this point, BTC will likely move back below $30,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) briefly rose above the $1,900 level in today’s session, after falling towards a support level of $1,830 on Monday.
 
Following a low of $1,840.22 to start the week, ETH/USD jumped to a peak at $1,905.36 earlier in the day.
 
Momentum has since shifted, with the world’s second largest cryptocurrency once again falling below the $1,900 level.
 
 
At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,881.79, with the RSI marginally below a resistance level of 58.00.
 
Overall, momentum is bullish, following a recent crossover between the 10-day (red) moving average, and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should this cross mature, there is a good chance that ETH will not only move above $1,900, but closer to $2,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of crypto, the influence of regulatory decisions is profound. Recently, emerging ecosystem tokens witnessed a considerable downturn in market capitalization. This shift comes in the wake of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings against prominent crypto exchange platforms, Binance and Coinbase.
 
These events have spurred concerns around the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and their classifications, notably affecting tokens such as Solana’s SOL and Polygon’s MATIC.

The second was the light — or the absence thereof: it was dark, with massive screens at regular intervals and neon lights shining elegantly across the ceiling.
