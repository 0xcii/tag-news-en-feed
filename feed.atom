        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Bloomberg, the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, Gabriel Makhlouf, has raised concerns about the potential risks associated with unbacked cryptocurrencies, which are more akin to a “Ponzi scheme” than an investment and pose risks to investors, according to the Governor.
 
Makhlouf stressed the importance of urgent policy action to address these risks and called for a regulatory regime to protect consumers and investors, prevent fraud, manipulation, and money laundering, and safeguard financial stability.
 
 
Combating Ponzi Schemes In Crypto
 
In the report, Governor Makhlouf equated “unbacked cryptocurrencies” to Ponzi schemes rather than investments. He expressed an “urgent need for policy action” that protects investors and consumers across the European Union through…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-05-09T20:20:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ishan Wahi,  
a former Product Manager at Coinbase, has been sentenced to two years  
imprisonment in a case US prosecutors called the country's first ever cryptocurrency  
insider trading case. Thirty-two-year-old Wahi from Washington bagged the jail  
term for tipping off his brother and friend on multiple occasions with  
confidential information about Coinbase’s upcoming token listings.
With the  
information, Wahi’s brother, Nikhil, and friend, Sameer Ramani made  
over $1.1 million from trading ahead of Coinbase’s public announcements,  
according to the US securities regulator which filed charges against  
the three individuals in July last year. 
Coinbase Former Employee Pleads Guilty
The US  
Department of Justice announced Wahi's fate on Tuesday, noting that he was  
sentenced by US District Judge Loretta Preska. However, prosecutors did not  
comment on the fate of Nikhil and Ramani.
The  
sentence comes over three months after Wahi pleaded guilty to two counts of  
conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The confession contradicts the former Coinbase staffer's claim in 2022 that he was not guilty of wrongdoing. 
“Today’s  
sentence should send a strong signal to all participants in the cryptocurrency  
markets that the laws decidedly do apply to them,” said Damian Williams, the US  
Attorney for the Southern District of New York. 
"[The district] will  
hold those who engage in insider trading to full account, regardless of whether  
their illegal conduct occurs in the equity markets or in the market for crypto  
assets," added Williams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum (ETH) developers are looking to implement a new upgrade known as MEV-burn, which aims to address the Miner Extractable Value (MEV) issue and further reduce the supply of ETH. The MEV-burn upgrade is a logical continuation of the EIP-1559 upgrade, implemented last year and marked the first time the network began burning ETH.
 
MEV refers to the profits miners can extract from reordering or censoring transactions in a block. As a result, it has become a major concern for the Ethereum community, particularly during times of high network congestion. With the recent rise of meme coins and other decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, MEV activity has become even more rampant, leading to skyrocketing gas prices and diminished returns for everyday users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Bitcoin exchange, Bull Bitcoin, has launched a new no-KYC (know-your-customer) service which enables users to buy bitcoin with cash or debit card. Users can go to any Canadian Post office, scan the QR code generated on the Bull Bitcoin app, and pay in cash or via debit card.
 
         
         
         
         
    
The funds are automatically added to the user's Bull Bitcoin account within a few minutes. Transactions of up to ~$745 ($999.99 CAD) can be made per transaction, with no KYC required. The exchange has a fee of 2% for no-KYC sats, the cheapest of any such service in Canada, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, while Bull Bitcoin's on-chain withdrawals remain free.
Canadian regulations state that Bitcoin exchanges must perform KYC and keep transaction records for all purchases above $1,000 CAD. Bull Bitcoin states that its privacy policy complies with the fair information principles in the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act (PIPEDA), which prevents it from collecting information that is not needed for a legitimate purpose. 
With no risk of chargeback for cash and debit card transactions, the company states that it has no legitimate reason to ask for KYC.
Bull Bitcoin aims to offer cash bitcoin purchases due to customer demand, and for those without access to bank accounts. The company also aims to attract migrant workers for remittances and users who want to limit the amount of personal information they give to trusted third parties. In addition, cash and debit card transactions are not subject to fraudulent chargebacks, unlike bank transfers and e-transfers. The process of funding accounts with cash or debit cards is also faster and more convenient.]]></summary>
