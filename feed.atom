Russia’s central bank revealed two weeks ago that it is further distancing itself from U.S. dollar dependence by purchasing the Chinese yuan on foreign exchange markets. Roughly around the same time, on Dec. 21, 2022, Sberbank executive and Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) member, Yaroslav Lissovolik, published an opinion article that talks about exploring the pathway toward a new BRICS reserve currency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum classic was one of the biggest movers to start the weekend, as prices surged to a six-week high. The move saw the token climb by as much as 12%, breaking out of a key resistance level in the process. Polygon also moved higher, as it raced towards a recent price ceiling. 
 
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
 
Ethereum classic (ETC) rose to a six-week high on Saturday, as prices rallied by as much as 14%.
 
Following a low of $17.94 on Friday, ETC/USD raced to a peak of $20.68 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of today’s move, ETC broke out of a key resistance level of $20.00, hitting its highest point since November 26 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s surge came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Recent rallies have also pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) close to overbought territory, with the indicator tracking at its highest point since last August.
 
Earlier gains have already begun to fade, with previous bulls likely moving to take profit at the level.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was another notable gainer to start the weekend, with the token climbing for a second straight day.
 
MATIC/USD raced to a high of $0.8105, which is over 3% higher than Friday’s low at the $0.774 mark.
 
Today’s gain has pushed polygon closer to a key resistance level of $0.8200, which was last hit on December 27.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, today’s surge has also led to a collision with a ceiling on the RSI, with the index hitting its resistance of 49.00
 
Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, and as of writing, MATIC/USD is trading at the $0.8039 point.
 
In order for MATIC to extend recent gains to a third session, price strength will first need to overcome the 49.00 ceiling on the RSI.

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved closer to the $17,000 level on Saturday, as traders continued to react to the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP).
 
Last month’s NFP numbers came in at 223,000, which is 23,000 higher than expected, and this was in a month where the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by less than in previous months.
 
In response to this, BTC/USD surged to a peak of $16,991.99 to start the weekend, hovering close to a three-week high in the process.

Bitcoin maximalists have had a whirlwind of a year. From getting browbeat through the recent price drawdown to being seemingly prophetic bell-ringers of the dumpster fire that is “crypto,” much of what has been written in the mainstream remains net negative. What’s concerning is that their centralized, authoritarian counterparts (referred to here as fiat maximalists) somehow maintain an air of superiority in the mainstream.

In addition, the study findings show that the fintech sub-sector alone accounted for 3,100 or 27% of the 11,462 people that were employed by tech startups during the same period. 
 
Fintechs Solving Fundamental Problems
 
According to the findings of a study on Kenya’s startup space, fintech ventures alone accounted for just over 30% or 93 out of the 308 tracked startups. This figure is almost three times more than that of the nearest challengers, namely agri-tech and e-health, which both accounted for 10.1% of Kenya’s tech startups that were tracked between January and November 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Huobi Token (HT) appears to be in a vulnerable state as it continues to deal with the drama that is happening within the Huobi cryptocurrency exchange.
 
While the crypto hiked its trading price by 3.2% during the last 24 hours to trade at $4.72 at the time of this writing according to tracking from Coingecko, the digital asset continues to struggle to regain some of its recent looses.
 
Over the previous seven and 14 days, HT has squandered 6.4% and 11.3% of its value, respectively, and is on the verge of another meltdown as suggested by some of its technical indicators.
 
The altcoin ended up being in an oversold position, making it more susceptible to a significant price decline which might come within the next few days.

But recently, the troubled ecosystem surpassed Shiba Inu and Tron in terms of market valuation. 
 
As of writing, SOL still held this advantage according to data from CoinMarketCap. This bullish action caused the crypto’s price to jump 0.9% in the daily timeframe, further beefing up its 36% increase in the past week.
