        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana rose by as much as 8% to start the week, as the token moved toward a one-month high. The token climbed for a second straight session, as the global banking crisis pushed investors towards cryptocurrencies. Chainlink was also higher, hitting a three-week high.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) moved closer to a one-month high to start the week, as prices surged by as much as 10% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $21.59 on Sunday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday peak of $23.83 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of Monday’s move, solana has now moved to its strongest point since late-February.
 
 
Overall, the token is now trading nearly 10% higher from the same point last week, when price was below $20.00.
 
Today’s surge has come following a breakout of a ceiling on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 58.85, which is marginally higher than its ceiling at the 57.00 mark.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
In addition to SOL, chainlink (LINK) was also in the green to start the week, with prices trading by as much as 3% higher.
 
LINK/USD rose to a peak of $7.38 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a low of $6.99.
 
This surge has seen chainlink move to its highest level since March 2, when the token was trading at a high of $7.57.
 
 
Like with solana, a catalyst for the move was a breakout which took place on the RSI indicator.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 57.00, which is marginally higher than the aforementioned resistance at 55.00
 
Should this upward momentum continue in the coming days, LINK will likely collide with a ceiling at $7.60.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the US banking crisis seems to be worsening each day, the crypto market including Bitcoin (BTC) has reacted to this in a positive manner. Over the past weeks, BTC has surged nearly 40% despite the condition of the financial sector. 
 
According to a recent report from economists using the now-bankrupted Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) analysis, more than 186 banks are prone to collapse following the fall of SVB. Per the report, Silicon Valley Bank had a higher capitalization of more than 10% of existing banks.
 
However, the analysts discovered that 10% of US banks currently have more unrecognized losses than the SVB which means the banking crisis is only expected to intensify over the coming months. Even so, Bitcoin’s continuous rally has proved to be inevitable amid this crisis.

UBS is purchasing Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion), which is around 60% less than the value of the bank when the markets closed on Friday.
 
It is highly possible that the merger of Credit Suisse and UBS will result in the loss of thousands of jobs in the United Kingdom. Together, the two banks are responsible for the employment of around 11,000 people at this time.
 
Both UBS and CS are regarded as being among the top 30 most important banks in the international monetary system, with the two lenders’ combined assets totaling close to $1.7 trillion.

Ethereum Fees Saw Huge Spike During The Local Bottom
 
As per data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the ETH transaction fee has fallen below $2 per transfer now. The relevant indicator here is the “average fees,” which measures the total amount of fees (in USD) that investors have to attach to their Ethereum transaction in order for it to go through on the blockchain.
 
The value of this metric can fluctuate depending on the traffic that the network is receiving. Generally, when there are a large number of transfers happening at once, transactions may take more time to be executed. So, those that want their transfers to go through quickly d…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crash of many firms last year alarmed both crypto users and regulators. One of the most notable was the FTX exchange crash and its unending contagion, which has spread into 2023. As a result, many regulators in different countries are taking steps to protect crypto users and investors. 
 
Some regulators, such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission, have been pushing hard with various enforcement actions against crypto firms allegedly engaging in practices putting investors at risk. Other countries, such as the UK, recently categorized digital assets in tax forms while three top financial regulators warned banks about digital asset dealings.
 
 
However, the latest move in digital asset regulation is from Taiwan, the Republic of China. It has announced a body to monitor the digit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was trading above $28,000 on Monday, as cryptocurrencies extended a bull run to start the week. This upwards sentiment comes as the Federal Reserve and other major central banks made coordinated moves to enhance market liquidity. Ethereum continues to trade close to $1,800.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the week trading above $28,000, as markets responded to the deepening global banking crisis.
 
The coordinated action by several major G7 central banks comes as Credit Suisse was bought out by rival UBS, a move engineered by Swiss authorities.
 
BTC/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $28,527.72 earlier today, which comes a day after trading at a low of $27,196.76.

As a result of the rally, bitcoin climbed to its strongest point since last June, with many now anticipating a move above $30,000.
 
Overall, this surge has sent prices into overbought territory, with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) now tracking at 72.73.
 
The next visible point of resistance appears to be at 75.00, and should this be hit, there is a strong chance BTC will be at $30,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
On the other hand, ethereum (ETH) consolidated recent gains during Monday’s session, as prices fell below $1,800.
 
Following a high of $1,843.84 on Sunday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,744.86 to start the week.
 
This drop comes as ethereum bulls appeared to be securing recent gains, days after ETH rose to its highest point since last August.

Overall, some are attributing the decline to the RSI, which fell below a long-term ceiling at the 66.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 63.74, with a floor at 62.00 a possible target for bears.
