journey, with a record-high percentage—70.35%—of the circulating supply  
remaining inactive for over a year, as reported by CoinDesk. This substantial figure, surpassing the  
previous peak in July, reflects a profound conviction among Bitcoin holders

seems, are resolute in their commitment.

The association's launch aims to bridge the gap in understanding and participation in Bitcoin within Serbia's burgeoning IT landscape.
Belgrade, known for its cultural vibrancy and historical innovation, is poised to attract foreign professionals, investors, and creative minds to engage with HUB21. While Serbia boasts a wealth of IT talent and has attracted international corporations, the absence of Bitcoin projects is apparent. Recognizing the transformative power of Bitcoin, HUB21 aims to train more aspiring programmers, artists, designers, and entrepreneurs to capitalize on the evolving interest in Bitcoin.
HUB21's agenda involves providing educational resources in Serbian, hosting regular meetups, workshops, seminars, and creating an inclusive space for industry novices and experts alike. The association's vision extends towards empowering local talent across various sectors to leverage Bitcoin and foster their initiatives.
Startups Primal.net and PeakShift have played pivotal roles in realizing HUB21's vision and by giving their support. The launch of HUB21's website offers a gateway to a diverse range of upcoming events, which can be viewed here.]]></summary>
