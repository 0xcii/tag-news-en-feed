        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past five days, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has experienced a period of heightened volatility, triggering significant liquidations of leveraged positions as its price fluctuated wildly in hours. 
 
After reaching an all-time high of $73,750 on Thursday, BTC experienced a sharp decline to $64,600 on Sunday. On Monday, at the start of the trading week, the cryptocurrency recaptured the $68,000 level. Nonetheless, it retraced over 2% shortly after, settling around the $66,800 mark.
 
Amidst this turbulent market activity, Binance Chief Executive Officer Richard Teng, as reported by Bloomberg, believes that Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally will persist, propelling its price beyond $80,000.

According to a Bloomberg report, Attestor’s trade became the talk of distressed investing circles as profits multiplied at an astonishing rate – 50%, 100%, and even close to 200%.

Bitcoin Is Shaky
 
The analysis is when Bitcoin prices appear shaky, characterized by sharp corrections. Over the weekend, prices plunged lower, denting confidence after a weak conclusion on Friday. Prices are yet to recover, trending below the psychological $70,000 level.
 
 
Even amid this, the analyst says people should hold on tightly, relaying confidence that the only way for the world’s most valuable coin is up. To support this outlook, the analyst compares Bitcoin’s price action and the historical trajectory of gold following the launch of Gold exchange-traded funds (ETF).

The halving, which occurs approximately every four years, marks a pivotal event in Bitcoin’s economic landscape, impacting both miners’ revenues and the network’s security.

This abrupt reduction in revenue poses challenges for miners, particularly those operating on narrow profit margins.
