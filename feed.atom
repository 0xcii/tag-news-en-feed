        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2023 is off to a rough start, with crypto business bankruptcies, inflation, and recession impacting markets and looming darker on the horizon. Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki says that other than bitcoin, the Unites States Securities and Exchange Commission is going to “crush” most cryptos with regulations. Other investors and economists such as Michael Burry and Peter Schiff have also been weighing in on the foreboding atmosphere for the year ahead. Still, peer-to-peer exchange without the need for institutions stifling economic freedom (the original value proposition of bitcoin) remains a reality, and so does the fact that there’s no shortage of crypto news. This is the Bitcoin.com News Week in Review.

According to a report by Bloomberg, U.S. prosecutors in New York – specifically, the city of  Brooklyn  – are assessing the internal transfers between the multibillion-dollar crypto conglomerate and its crypto lending arm, Genesis Global Capital. 
 
The crypto lending company has been in the spotlight for a long time following its heavy losses last year. 
 
Based on anonymous sources that are close to the investigation, the federal prosecutors are already conducting interviews with certain personnel and requesting office documents. 
 
Commenting on the matter, a DCG spokesman denied the American venture capital firm was under any investigation.

This is an opinion editorial by Trey Walsh, the senior director for youth programs at the MassHire Metro North Workforce Board of Somerville, Massachusetts.
Our world has seen dramatic shifts and changes over the past several years: a global pandemic, war, political unrest and a growing sense of pessimism toward governments, the future health of our planet and our global financial system. And there is one group, particularly in the Western world and United States, that has grown increasingly dissatisfied and, in some cases, hopeless above the rest: Gen Z. 
But I believe there is one big reason for hope that this generation hasn’t fully realized yet: Bitcoin.

While expressing his thoughts in a speech he made in Paris on January 5, the governor of the Bank of France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, pointed toward the ongoing market volatility as a reason and pushed to implement an obligatory licensing system “as soon as possible.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin, following the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, continues to struggle not only in terms of its trading price but also in its profitability.
 
It can be recalled that the company, back in November 2022, moved to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a U.S. county court, and collapsed in just a matter of days.
 
Bitcoin, being the main driving force of the crypto market, was greatly affected by this unfortunate development and eventually exited 2022 with a value that was significantly lesser than what it had back in 2021.
 
According to BTC data aggregator Statmuse, the maiden digital coin had an average price of $47,500 in 2021 but it closed last year with a median value of $28,171, losing 64.3% of its price for the year.

In fact, the business mogul said it is no longer a question of whether this will happen or not but rather when will another market crippling event will unfold. This time around, centralized exchanges will unfortunately take the spotlight courtesy of “wash trades.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following reports that the crypto payments firm Wyre was shutting down operations, CEO Ioannis Giannaros offered a contradicting story, stating that the firm was merely “scaling back.” Wyre has now announced that it is “modifying” its withdrawal policy, citing the crypto industry downturn and the “macroeconomic climate” as factors that have affected the company. On Friday, Wyre stated that it is now “exploring strategic options.”

Russia’s central bank revealed two weeks ago that it is further distancing itself from U.S. dollar dependence by purchasing the Chinese yuan on foreign exchange markets. Roughly around the same time, on Dec. 21, 2022, Sberbank executive and Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) member, Yaroslav Lissovolik, published an opinion article that talks about exploring the pathway toward a new BRICS reserve currency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum classic was one of the biggest movers to start the weekend, as prices surged to a six-week high. The move saw the token climb by as much as 12%, breaking out of a key resistance level in the process. Polygon also moved higher, as it raced towards a recent price ceiling. 
 
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
 
Ethereum classic (ETC) rose to a six-week high on Saturday, as prices rallied by as much as 14%.
 
Following a low of $17.94 on Friday, ETC/USD raced to a peak of $20.68 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of today’s move, ETC broke out of a key resistance level of $20.00, hitting its highest point since November 26 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s surge came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Recent rallies have also pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) close to overbought territory, with the indicator tracking at its highest point since last August.
 
Earlier gains have already begun to fade, with previous bulls likely moving to take profit at the level.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was another notable gainer to start the weekend, with the token climbing for a second straight day.
 
MATIC/USD raced to a high of $0.8105, which is over 3% higher than Friday’s low at the $0.774 mark.
 
Today’s gain has pushed polygon closer to a key resistance level of $0.8200, which was last hit on December 27.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, today’s surge has also led to a collision with a ceiling on the RSI, with the index hitting its resistance of 49.00
 
Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, and as of writing, MATIC/USD is trading at the $0.8039 point.
 
In order for MATIC to extend recent gains to a third session, price strength will first need to overcome the 49.00 ceiling on the RSI.
