        <updated>2023-01-11T13:36:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin raced to a fresh multi-week high on Wednesday, as markets turned their attention to tomorrow’s U.S. inflation rate report. Thursday’s report is expected to show that consumer prices have fallen to 6.5%, down from 7.1% the month prior. Ethereum also rose marginally higher in the day.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rallied above a key resistance level on Wednesday, ahead of tomorrow’s U.S. inflation report.
 
Following a low of $17,226.64 on Tuesday, BTC/USD raced to a peak of $17,493.32 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed to its strongest point since December 15.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s price surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a resistance point at the 60.00 mark.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 63.80. This comes as BTC continues to hover around its own ceiling at the $17,400 mark.
 
In order to move closer to the $18,000 zone, the RSI will first need to move beyond a ceiling of 64.00 on the RSI.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also marginally higher in today’s session, with prices continuing to trade below a long-term ceiling
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,342.76 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,324.97.
 
Overall, ethereum remains below a resistance point of $1,350, with many expecting prices to move after the release of U.S. inflation figures tomorrow.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the consolidation below this price ceiling comes as the RSI continues to trade under a hurdle of its own.
 
Price strength is now tracking at the 68.73 level, which is under a point of resistance at the 70.00 mark.
 
ETH bulls are likely still targeting a move beyond $1,400, however, in order for this to happen, the RSI level of 70.00 must first be overcome.

Bitcoin Spot Trading Volume Has Gone Up A Bit This Week
 
As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, there has been low speculative activity in the BTC market recently. The “trading volume” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin being transacted on the Bitwise 10 exchanges on any given day.
 
While the volume on the Bitwise 10 exchanges is certainly not all the activity there is in the entire BTC market, the reason why they have been chosen is that their data is the most reliable available out of all the platforms, and their volumes still provide a decent approximation for what the trend in the complete s…]]></summary>

This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, a content creator and small business owner.
Nothing is more critical to long-term health than having access to healthcare when needed. But every jurisdiction around the world implements this process differently.

Moreover, they want to invest in a variety of tools with the same speed and commissions as centralized platforms. Perhaps now is the perfect time to start something new, since Uniswap and MakerDAO entered the market after a long crypto winter and changed the cryptocurrency industry forever.
