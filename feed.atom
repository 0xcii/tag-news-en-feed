“Over four million Mexicans can now pay with bitcoin for their cable, internet, and phone service,” IBEX’s CEO Jose Lemus said on stage as he announced the partnership. “With this partnership, we’re opening the doors to every bitcoin and Lightning company and financial tech company that wants to leverage Lightning technology … [we will be] rolling out new technology with Grupo Salinas that will enable mexicans to pay their groceries with bitcoin, electronics and to receive remittances.” Lemus explained his excitement about the announcement, saying that this is the “tip of the iceberg of what will go on in Mexico.” 
The collaboration signifies a major step in Mexico's adoption of bitcoin and Lightning. In addition, the integration of Lightning payments via IBEX with Total Play opens up new possibilities for fast and efficient transactions for Total Play customers.
“The true value of this technology is not about paying for a cup of coffee in a different way,” Lemus said. “In a world where we’re going to have increasing digitization of our products and services, we need better payment technology … we did not have a good enough payments technology — but now we do, with Lightning.” 
Integration of bitcoin Lightning in Grupo Salinas’ products and services via IBEX can place Mexico at the forefront of the digital revolution, providing citizens with a secure, modern and efficient payment option.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MicroBT, the Bitcoin ASIC manufacturer behind the WhatsMiner line of ASIC mining machines, unveiled its latest offerings at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami Beach. Dr. Zuoxing Yang, the founder and CEO of MicroBT, highlighted the importance of "High density, low noise, low failure rate and low maintenance” ASIC machines bringing bitcoin mining to a new era.
The talk started with a roll of film focusing on the energy crisis, green energy and the role that bitcoin can play as a solution. It then posed the question: “What matters more, mining or surviving?” 
“I never stop thinking of better power solutions for bitcoin mining,” Dr. Yang said. 
MicroBT introduced three new models of the WhatsMiner M50 series: the air-cooled M50S++, the hydro-cooled M53S++, and the immersion cooled M56S++. These models offer impressive computing power ranging from 150 to 320 terahash/second (TH/s) respectively, with power efficiencies of 22 joules per terahash (J/TH).
Dr. Yang highlighted the heat collection capabilities of the mining rigs, which can be utilized for various purposes, such as space heating and industrial processes. He mentioned that the hydro-cooling mining rigs can reach outlet water temperatures of over 70℃ (158℉), enabling 2.4MW of power for a 40-foot container. Additionally, the immersion-cooling solution requires only 10L of oil per miner, demonstrating its efficiency.
He emphasized that “every M56 miner only requires as low as 10L oil with our specified tank.” 
MicroBT's focus since its inception in 2016 has been the development of high-efficiency Bitcoin mining rigs. The company aims to support miners in adhering to Bitcoin's decentralization principles while prioritizing network stability. Dr. Yang emphasized MicroBT's commitment to working with partners to promote sustainable mining practices, zero-carbon emissions and social responsibility.]]></summary>

The rocket carrying a physical Bitcoin wallet is scheduled to launch from the Kennedy Space Center this summer, marking a significant milestone for both space exploration and the bitcoin industry.
The bitcoin, engraved with a public address and private key, is loaded with 1 BTC and will become the first-ever financial asset sent to space. This endeavor symbolizes the exploration of Bitcoin's use cases beyond Earth and opens up possibilities for future interaction with the token. Stephan Lutz, Acting CEO and Group CFO at BitMEX, expressed pride in the achievement, stating, "This is not just an achievement for BitMEX, but a breakthrough in human history."
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the mission has undergone rigorous testing and preparation to ensure the Bitcoin wallet's readiness for space flight.
In addition to the physical bitcoin, the text of the Genesis Block, the first block of Bitcoin ever mined, will be carried to the Moon as a homage to Satoshi's protocol. The Genesis Block will be displayed on a metal plate with raw hex data and a hologram of the Bitcoin Magazine logo.
A replica of the coin and Genesis Block metal plate, placed on a "moon rock" will be auctioned in partnership with Bitcoin Magazine at Bitcoin 2023. In addition, a limited edition series of commemorative coins and Ordinals will be auctioned closer to the launch date.]]></summary>
