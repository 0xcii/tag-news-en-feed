DeDotFi has confirmed that over $31 million was stolen in the hacking incident. However, there are further reports indicating that the scale of the compromise may be even more substantial, with some estimates suggesting that up to $100 million worth of funds could have been compromised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin neared a breakout below the $29,000 level on Monday, as traders prepared for this week’s Federal Reserve rate decision. In addition to the Fed meeting, consumer confidence data will also be released from the United States. Ethereum hit a three-week low. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was on the brink of falling outside of the $29,000 mark on Monday, as traders began to prepare for a big week of economic data.
 
Following Sunday’s high of $30,330.64, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $29,068.48 earlier in the session.
 
This drop has resulted in bitcoin falling to its weakest point since June 21, which is the last time price was below $29,000.

Overall, bitcoin is over 3% lower than at the same time last week, with today’s sell-off coming when the relative strength index (RSI) fell below a floor of 45.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 42.93, with the next visible resistance point at the 41.00 mark.
 
Should the index reach this level, it is highly likely that BTC will be trading around the $28,800 level.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) also edged lower to start the week, once again dropping below $1,900.
 
ETH/USD slipped to a bottom at $1,837.98 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after peaking at $1,904.48.
 
Similar to BTC, ethereum has moved to a multi-week low as a result, with the price trading at its weakest point since June 8.

A downward crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages has also occurred, which is a sign of potential bearish sentiment.
 
Further, the RSI is now at a reading of 44.67, which is its lowest point since June 19, when price was last under $1,800.
 
Bears may make another attempt to leave the $1,800 mark in the coming days.

In a July 23 tweet, Republican representative Warren Davidson condemned any potential move to launch a CBDC, noting that a digital currency flaws the ethos of money. Davidson urged Congress to ban and criminalize any effort to establish a central bank digital currency.
 
CBDC Is The Financial Equivalent Of Death Star, Says Congressman Davidson
 
 Warren Davidson, the Ohio 8th Congressional District representative, stressed that money should not be programmable by a central authority. According to him, the Federal Reserve’s move to develop a CBDC is like “building the financial equivalent of the Death Star.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Ben Caselin, chief strategy officer for cryptocurrency exchange MaskEx.
As we navigate the uncharted waters of the digital revolution, bitcoin is increasingly finding their footing in economies grappling with currency crises. Countries such as Turkey, Lebanon, Nigeria and Argentina are already seeing bitcoin reach, or start to approximate, new all-time price highs, signaling a shift in wealth preservation and financial sovereignty. The thrust behind this trend is multifold, encompassing inflationary pressures, the global dominance of the U.S. dollar and the unique attributes of bitcoin.
A quick Google search for bitcoin against so-called “weaker” currencies in emerging markets, over a five-year time horizon, paints a clear picture.
