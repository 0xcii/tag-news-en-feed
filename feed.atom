        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Core Scientific, a Bitcoin miner that took a massive hit with previously falling crypto prices, received approval for Chapter 11 restructuring from a US bankruptcy judge. Following this decision, the company is expected to re-list its shares on Nasdaq by the end of January.
Restructuring of Core Scientific
The decision yesterday (Tuesday) allowed the Bitcoin miner company to cut its debt by $400 million and preserve 240 jobs. The judge highlighted that the process “provides a tremendous recovery for both unsecured creditors and also equity holders.”
Under the restructuring terms, the company’s existing shareholders will receive 60 percent of the new equity in common stock and warrants. The approval of the restructuring followed the closure of a proposed $55 million equity rights offering e…]]></summary>

This delay grants authorities time to extradite Kwon from Montenegro, allowing him to potentially attend the trial for the first time.
 
SEC Seeks Trial Delay Amid Cooperation
 
Just days after a judge firmly rejected motions to reconsider earlier orders, the SEC, in a surprising move, requested a “modest adjournment” to accommodate Kwon’s extradition proceedings. This comes despite previous uncertainty surrounding Do Kwon’s presence, facing criminal charges in the US and South Korea alongside his ongoing detainment in Montenegro.
 
 
However, a critical change emerged: Kwon’s legal team indicated his willingnes…]]></summary>
