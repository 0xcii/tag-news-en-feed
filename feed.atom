Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin Advocates for Higher Gas Limit to Improve Network Capacity
 
Ethereum ecosystem co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed an increase in the network’s gas limit. This adjustment, aimed at augmenting network capacity, could potentially lower costs for users and enhance transaction efficiency.
 
Ethereum’s gas limit is the ceiling for the total amount of gas allowed in a single block. Gas, a fee necessary for conducting transactions or executing contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, ensures the network’s operational fluidity. Presently, the gas limit stands at 30 million.

More Than 12 Million XRP Burned
 
According to data from the XRPScan website, the total number of XRP coins that have been burned so far has crossed the 12 million mark. At current market prices, this means that the community has collectively sent over $6.8 million worth of tokens to the burn address.
 
 
However, while this figure may seem significant, it is quite small when compared to the maximum supply of the token. The XRP max supply is 100 billion, and with only 12 million tokens so far, it is barely making a dent …]]></summary>

What Is The Major Issue With Spot Bitcoin ETFs
 
Roberts raised concerns over Bitcoin’s limited supply in an X (formerly Twitter) post, something which he believes could be an issue with the Bitcoin ETFs. He noted how this class of ETFs happens to be the first with an underlying asset whose supply is capped at a particular amount. BTC’s maximum total supply is 21 million BTC, and no more can be mined after that.

This time around there are many more alternative designs for covenants being proposed, and actual concrete designs that make use of CTV as scaling solutions (Timeout Trees and Ark). The conversation has a much larger depth of concepts to take into consideration, both in terms of alternatives that could be adopted as well as concrete proposals that CTV could enable. 
One narrative circulating from the camp of people against CTV is that “CTV doesn’t scale Bitcoin.” Let’s charitably interpret that to mean that CTV itself does not scale Bitcoin, things you can build with it do.
