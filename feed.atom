The Attorney General’s office had successfully obtained $4.3 million from Coin Cafe, which had deceived investors by falsely offering free Bitcoin storage on company-hosted wallets.
 
Instead of fulfilling their promise, the platform stealthily imposed exorbitant user fees. According to the statement, Coin Cafe has officially admitted to the deceptive practice of regularly implementing and escalating fees without providing adequate disclosure to investors.
 
 
The trading platform had charged one customer over $10,000 in fees within a month and another investor an astonishing amount of over $51,000.

        <updated>2023-05-18T21:35:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MicroBT, the Bitcoin ASIC manufacturer behind the WhatsMiner line of ASIC mining machines, unveiled its latest offerings at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami Beach. Dr. Zuoxing Yang, the founder and CEO of MicroBT, highlighted the importance of "High density, low noise, low failure rate and low maintenance” ASIC machines bringing bitcoin mining to a new era.
The talk started with a roll of film focusing on the energy crisis, green energy and the role that bitcoin can play as a solution. It then posed the question: “What matters more, mining or surviving?” 
“I never stop thinking of better power solutions for bitcoin mining,” Dr. Yang said. 
MicroBT introduced three new models of the WhatsMiner M50 series: the air-cooled M50S++, the hydro-cooled M53S++, and the immersion cooled M56S++. These models offer impressive computing power ranging from 150 to 320 terahash/second (TH/s) respectively, with power efficiencies of 22 joules per terahash (J/TH).
Dr. Yang highlighted the heat collection capabilities of the mining rigs, which can be utilized for various purposes, such as space heating and industrial processes. He mentioned that the hydro-cooling mining rigs can reach outlet water temperatures of over 70℃ (158℉), enabling 2.4MW of power for a 40-foot container. Additionally, the immersion-cooling solution requires only 10L of oil per miner, demonstrating its efficiency.
He emphasized that “every M56 miner only requires as low as 10L oil with our specified tank.” 
MicroBT's focus since its inception in 2016 has been the development of high-efficiency Bitcoin mining rigs. The company aims to support miners in adhering to Bitcoin's decentralization principles while prioritizing network stability. Dr. Yang emphasized MicroBT's commitment to working with partners to promote sustainable mining practices, zero-carbon emissions and social responsibility.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BitMEX, a leading bitcoin derivatives exchange, has announced that it will be sending the first physical bitcoin to the Moon in partnership with Astrobotic Technology Inc. and Bitcoin Magazine. The rocket carrying a physical Bitcoin wallet is scheduled to launch from the Kennedy Space Center this summer, marking a significant milestone for both space exploration and the bitcoin industry.
The bitcoin, engraved with a public address and private key, is loaded with 1 BTC and will become the first-ever financial asset sent to space. This endeavor symbolizes the exploration of Bitcoin's use cases beyond Earth and opens up possibilities for future interaction with the token. Stephan Lutz, Acting CEO and Group CFO at BitMEX, expressed pride in the achievement, stating, "This is not just an achievement for BitMEX, but a breakthrough in human history."
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the mission has undergone rigorous testing and preparation to ensure the Bitcoin wallet's readiness for space flight.
In addition to the physical bitcoin, the text of the Genesis Block, the first block of Bitcoin ever mined, will be carried to the Moon as a homage to Satoshi's protocol. The Genesis Block will be displayed on a metal plate with raw hex data and a hologram of the Bitcoin Magazine logo.]]></summary>
