This move by the country’s top financial regulator targets a loophole that has allowed Korean citizens to circumvent existing regulations limiting cryptocurrency purchases using traditional credit cards.
 
 
The proposed amendment, if implemented, would further tighten South Korea’s grip on the burgeoning crypto market, raising questions about its potential impact on individual financial freedom and the broader adoption of digital assets within the country.

When the value of this metric goes down, it means that these chain validators are currently transferring their coins out of their addresses. Generally, one of the main reasons miners would decide to withdraw is for selling purposes, so this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on BTC.
