        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Javier Milei, who is well-known for his ardent advocacy of Bitcoin, became victorious in the run-off election for president of Argentina on November 19, surpassing his opponent Sergio Massa.
 
The unexpectedly large margin of victory went to Milei, who rode a tide of voter resentment against the political establishment. His opponent, Sergio Massa, the Peronist minister of the economy, conceded after receiving little more than 44% of the vote; he received around 56%.
 
Based on figures by Bloomberg, Milei secured a dominant 55% of the votes with nearly 99% counted, establishing a solid lead of about 3 million votes.

Preceding the official announcement of the results, Massa congratulated Milei on his victory in a phone call.

The book is set in the fictional state of Oceania, where a dystopian future has taken over the reins of society. The leader of the nation, Big Brother, keeps a constant eye on citizens, making sure that they think, act, and speak precisely how they should further the aims of the rulers. 
Governed by the Party, the people of Oceania have no form of freedom, not in the way they think, the way they speak, or in what they do.

Javier Milei's  
Presidential Victory: A Catalyst for Bitcoin's Ascent
Javier Milei, a self-described  
anarcho-capitalist, secured the Argentine presidency, heralding a new era with  
his unorthodox economic views. A key aspect of Milei's stance is his vocal  
support for Bitcoin, which he regards as a means of returning monetary control
