Since then, the company has steadily increased its Bitcoin holdings by buying more every two months, even though market conditions have changed.

stablecoin issuers signals a significant shift in its financial oversight  
landscape. By implementing a robust framework, the city aims to safeguard

The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and

This decision stems from the increasing prevalence and evolving nature of  
virtual assets, which necessitate a clear regulatory approach to manage  
potential risks effectively.
