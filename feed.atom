        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/xrps-rise-causes-ripple-of-gains-in-crypto-economy/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since July 12, 2023, the cryptocurrency market has expanded by a staggering $60 billion within a mere 48 hours. The majority of this growth transpired after the decisive Ripple Labs case verdict, resulting in bitcoin’s dominance dipping from 50% to its present level of 48.6%.
 
Ripple Labs Case Verdict Triggers $60 Billion Crypto Market Expansion
 
The partial summary judgment within the Ripple lawsuit propelled the digital asset XRP to a 60%+ increase within a single day. Consequently, XRP’s substantial gains triggered a surge in numerous altcoins’ values. For example, Stellar (XLM) saw an increase of over 40%, while ADA leaped more than 20% in the past day. Archived data retrieved from coinmarketcap.com (CMC) on July 12, 2023, exhibited Bitcoin’s dominance at 50% in relation to the $1.19 trillion crypto economy.
 
 
Currently, BTC dominance has diminished to 48.6% due to significant returns in the altcoin arena overshadowing its market presence. Just two days ago, XRP ranked as the sixth largest market capitalization among multiple crypto assets; however, it now boasts the fourth-largest position. While XRP experienced a 70% increase within 24 hours, its impressive ascent propelled its monthly gains above 50%.
 
In addition to XRP, other notable crypto gainers over the past day include XLM, SNX, LDO, SOL, ADA, INJ, NEAR, AVAX, PEPE, APE, and OP. Archived data from CMC on July 12 further reveals that during the previous two-day period, the cryptocurrency market swelled by $60 billion.
 
 
Furthermore, global trade volume skyrocketed from $29.32 billion to today’s staggering $73.46 billion — proving that in just one day, worldwide trade volume in cryptocurrencies soared by an incredible 160%. The top three digital assets concerning global trade volume consist of USDT, BTC, and XRP.

        <updated>2023-07-14T15:38:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP soared by as much as 70% higher on Friday, as markets continued to react to a court ruling that the token is not a security. On Thursday, U.S. judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not “necessarily a security on its face.” Solana also surged on the news, climbing by nearly 30%. 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was undoubtedly one of the biggest movers in the market on Friday, surging by nearly 70%.
 
Following a low of $0.4728 on Thursday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.8875 during today’s session.
 
Traders continued to long for the token as exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken moved to relist XRP on their platform.
 
 
Overall, this rally has pushed XRP to its strongest point since Christmas day of 2021, when price peaked at $0.9975.
 
From the chart, the move began after the relative strength index (RSI) moved past a ceiling at 75.00.
 
The index went on to reach a high of 88.00, however as traders have begun to secure gains, price strength is now at 80.59.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
In addition to XRP, solana (SOL) also soared higher in today’s session, rising by nearly 30% in the process.
 
SOL/USD moved to a peak of $30.06 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after the price was at a low of $22.23.
 
As a result of this, solana hit its highest level since last November, following a breakout of a ceiling at $26.00.
 
 
The token is now trading at $27.78, which appears to be a result of profit takers closing previous positions.
 
Additionally, the RSI is deep in overbought territory, which will likely tempt further short selling in the coming days.

The addresses are divided into these wallet groups based on the total number of coins that they are holding right now. The 10-100 coins group, for example, includes all addresses carrying a balance of at least 10 BTC and at most 100 BTC.
