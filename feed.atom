        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The hype around Shiba Inu and the metaverse of SHIB has now reached the mainstream media. In a new article, CNBC examines whether Shiba Inu can displace the still largest meme coin Dogecoin from its throne in the future.
 
And the verdict should please the SHIB community: CNBC believes SHIB will overtake its biggest competitor, though it could take “more than a year.”
 
Shiba Inu Vs. Dogecoin
 
As CNBC discusses in its article, both dog coins have dominated much of the meme coin market share in recent years. Other meme coins, such as FLOKI, fall far short of the capital that SHIB and DOGE have already been able to attract through their large fan communities.

The first is the earnings report from Tesla, which has provided a positive backdrop for the cryptocurrency. Shares in Tesla were down over 4% after the electric vehicle builder posted Q1 earnings after the bell.
 
Additionally, traders eagerly anticipate the Starship launch on Thursday, which promises to be the most powerful rocket launch in the history of mankind.
 
With all eyes on these two events, investors are speculating about whether Tesla will reveal any new plans for its existing holdings of DOGE.

At the time of writing, the soaring trajectory of Bitcoin’s price took a sudden nosedive over the past 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency’s value plummeting by 3.88.% to a disappointing $29,901 according to CoinMarketCap. 
 

 
 
Adding to its woes, Bitcoin also experienced a seven-day slump of 4.03%, causing investors to question whether the digital asset’s once-meteoric rise has come to a screeching halt.
