        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a recent report, the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex received a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March, signaling a potential lawsuit. The SEC’s enforcement division sent the Wells notice prior to Bittrex deciding to wind down its operations in the United States.
 
‘Lack of Regulatory Clarity’ in the U.S. Adds Uncertainty for Cryptocurrency Exchanges
 
On Sunday, April 16, 2023, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex was informed of a potential lawsuit and enforcement action in the form of a Wells notice. A Wells notice is essentially a letter from the U.S. SEC that informs an individual or company of the regulator’s intent to take enforcement action against them.

Did The Fallen Crypto Giant Knew About The Crash?
 
TerraLabs, founded by Kwon, is a blockchain ecosystem that included a stablecoin token called TerraUSD, and a sister token called Luna, which suffered a significant collapse in May 2022. The collapse wiped out over $50 billion in market capitalization of UST/LUNA and caused over $400 billion in losses for the broader cryptocurrency market.
 
Following this event, South Korean prosecutors have confirmed that Do Kwon transfer…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-moves-below-30000-on-monday-as-us-dollar-rallies/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-17T12:40:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week trading below $30,000, as the U.S. dollar strengthened during Monday’s session. USD/JPY rose to a one-month high, with the greenback also gaining against the euro and British pound. Ethereum was also lower, falling below $2,100.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $30,000 mark on Monday, as a strong U.S. dollar weakened cryptocurrency markets.
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $29,816.72, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $30,555.54.
 
Monday’s price slippage comes two days after bitcoin rose above $31,000 for the first time since June 7.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Ultimately, this recent bull run pushed BTC into overbought territory, with the relative strength index (RSI) hitting a ceiling of 71.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 63.45, with a floor at the 59.00 mark potentially approaching.
 
Should price strength continue to move towards this level, there is a good chance that BTC will move below a floor at $29,600.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) mostly consolidated to start the week, as price moved below the $2,100 mark on Monday.
 
Following a high of $2,137.45 on Sunday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $2,076.18 earlier in today’s session.
 
Monday’s decline sees the world’s second largest cryptocurrency drop from a recent 11-month high.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Similar to bitcoin, this decline coincided with the 14-day RSI failing to break out of a ceiling, and in this instance it was at the 75.00 mark.
 
Despite this, ETH remains close to the $2,100 mark, helped by the fact the index is still above its floor at 69.00
 
If this point of support were to break, then bears would likely reenter the market.

Bitcoin Funding Rate Was Highly Positive Yesterday
 
Bitcoin had been holding around the $30,000 level pretty well during the past week, but the cryptocurrency has observed a decline below the mark today.
 
The signs that a drop would be coming were apparently visible yesterday, as an analyst in a CryptoQuant post had pointed out. To be more specific, two futures market indicators, the open interest and funding rates, had values that may have hinted towards the asset’s decline in advance.
 
The “open interest” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts that are currently open on the derivative exchanges. This metric acc…]]></summary>
