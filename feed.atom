Trump’s statements, made on late Tuesday, suggest a strategic pivot towards making the US a dominant force in BTC mining.
 
“Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC. Biden’s hatred of Bitcoin only helps China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left. We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!! It will help us be ENERGY DOMINANT,” Trump declared, underscoring his vision of Bitcoin as a critical asset in the nation’s energy strategy.

This unexpected steadiness triggered a sharp reaction in the crypto world, with Bitcoin’s price plummeting from $70,000 to $66,000 and Ethereum experiencing a similar downturn. The FOMC’s reluctance to cut rates, despite previous indications of multiple reductions, has amplified volatility, leading to nearly $400 million in liquidations and shaking investor confidence across the board.
