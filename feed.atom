He arrived in Tokyo on July 30 for EDCON 2024, making an indelible impression. He wore a black, loose-fitting kimono with large sleeves as he entered the stage, cloaked in mystery and whimsy, in contrast to his usual basic manner. The centerpiece of this look was an eye-catching black-and-white horse-head mask that both delighted and perplexed the spectators.
 
The guests laughed at the pretense and went along with the ruse despite his distinctive appearance and manner. A voice said, “Who are you?” from the throng. Buterin announced himself as a “Dogecoin hodler” with a flourish, which made people laugh and wonder at the same time. The short show, however, created a lighth…]]></summary>

The altcoin has been relatively quiet, with its price declining, leaving many investors and traders feeling uncertain. However, a notable bullish proponent continues behind the scenes, indicating a potential shift in market dynamics. 
 
In the last few days, on-chain data has revealed a significant accumulation pattern for ETH. This bullish catalyst has materialized in the form of whale accumulation, where large investors, commonly called “whales,” have been making substantial purchases of Ethereum. These whales have acquired hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ETH, signaling their anticipation of an imminent price surge.

Technically, the zone between $66,000 and $70,000 is a crucial zone that buyers must decisively break for the uptrend to develop. Any lift-off above $72,000 would be ideal, as it is the last resistance before an all-time high of around $74,000.

However, even though bitcoin has set a new all-time high and had two years of a near-constant positive trajectory, we're yet to see a consistent influx of retail investors. The potential for a surge in retail participation and the possibility of elevating the bitcoin price to unprecedented levels are prospects that many investors are anxiously anticipating. In this article, we're going to explore when we might see these retail investors dive back into the bitcoin pool and whether their return could indeed propel BTC to even greater heights.
