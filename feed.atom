        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has responded to a recent statement by Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, with a sharp criticism of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Grewal questioned the SEC’s understanding of investment contracts in connection with cryptocurrencies.
 
He emphasized that the term “investments” does not inherently constitute “investment contracts” and pointed out that investment contracts must entail rights to the future income, profits, or assets of an enterprise. This view aligns with the SEC’s own stance in the Edwards case presented before the Supreme Court, where the SEC described investment contracts as having the character of “debt [or] equity participation.”

Currently there are many issues with seamless integration of Bitcoin to fiat exchanges inside of applications, chief among them being lack of Lightning support by many brokerages. In addition to that, each brokerage service in the market builds proprietary APIs for integration with their services, increasing the overhead of integration of multiple options by application and wallet developers. Breez SDK’s support for the FiatLink API can facilitate a single solution to both problems.
FiatLink, as an open interface standard, would also allow seamless integration of multiple brokerage options inside a Lightning application or wallet. Rather than h…]]></summary>

This can happen gradually then suddenly, but resistance will be there. People do not easily change their world views. We (Americans) are about to experience the next chapter in the great monetary war, by way of a Bitcoin ETF approval. This approval will change the course of Bitcoin adoption for better or worse, and is a good reason to be warned of what is to come.
The Bitcoin ETF approval will send a huge message to money managers around the world, that is that “We, the US Government, deem bitcoin a safe asset for you to invest in”. Now If you're like me, you could care less what the SEC says or does, this is freedom money. But for millions of people across America, this is a big green flag that i…]]></summary>

The prospective green light for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a hot topic, with traders mulling over whether it’ll catalyze a “buy the rumor sell the news” scenario or herald a significantly bullish turn.
 
Bitcoin
 
There’s a tangible sense of anticipation for the SEC’s verdict, believed by many to have been factored into the past quarter’s bitcoin price movements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase is acquiring a Cyprus-based entity with a MiFID  
license, paving the way for wider access to its derivatives products in Europe.
This strategic move aligns with  
Coinbase's "Go Broad, Go Deep" plan, aiming to establish clear  
regulatory frameworks and secure licenses for international expansion. The  
MiFID license will allow Coinbase to offer derivatives to eligible customers  
across select EU countries.
Coinbase Gears Up for EU Expansion
The acquisition targets the lucrative  
derivatives market, estimated to account for roughly 75% of the global crypto  
space. By expanding its derivatives offerings, Coinbase hopes to capture a  
significant share of this market and solidify its position as a leading crypto  
player.
Recognizing the importance of trust  
and compliance, Coinbase emphasizes its adherence to a rigorous Five-point  
Global Compliance Standard. This standard covers vetting personnel,  
implementing strict AML/KYC procedures, enforcing global sanctions, upholding  
governance best practices, and conducting ongoing monitoring and reporting.
Over 400 experienced compliance and  
legal professionals, with backgrounds in prestigious institutions like the FBI,  
DOJ, and major banks, guide Coinbase's compliance efforts. This expertise  
ensures adherence to international regulations and safeguards against potential  
risks.
While finalizing the acquisition and  
operationalizing the entity lie ahead, this move marks a significant step  
towards Coinbase's vision of a more global and open financial system. By  
providing wider access to derivatives within a robust compliance framework, Coinbase aims to  
empower more than 1 billion people with increased economic freedom.

Coinbase is planning a pivotal acquisition that will allow it to launch crypto derivatives in the EU https://t.co/7jH4kxkpf1
