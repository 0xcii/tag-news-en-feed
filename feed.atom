        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s arrest and the statements from his co-workers Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, the spotlight has turned on the remaining executives who were part of the team’s inner circle. Another person people are curious about these days is Alameda Research’s ex-co-CEO Sam Trabucco. The 30-year-old executive left Alameda in Aug. 2022, but since Ellison detailed misconduct happened in 2019, it’s assumed that Trabucco knows a thing or two about what happened.
 
Spotlights Remain on a Few More FTX and Alameda Execs Like Sam Trabucco
 
Since Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was arrested and then later released on bail, attention has been drawn toward executives who have not come forward, or at least not publicly announced they have been cooperating with law enforcement.

In the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances. 
 
We kicked us this special with an institutional guest, asset management firm Blofin. In early December, they wrote an essay called “Catastrophe, Survival, and Evolution: Writing After November’s Crypto Markets” which inspired this series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana fell to a one-month low to start the weekend, as cryptocurrency markets moved lower ahead of Christmas Day. Today’s drop saw the token fall for a fourth straight session, as market sentiment shifted bearish. Uniswap was also in the red on Saturday, with price falling for a second consecutive day.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was in the red on Saturday, as prices moved lower for a fourth straight session.
 
SOL/USD slipped to a low of $11.24 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after the token was trading at $11.95.
 
Today’s drop saw solana fall to its lowest point since November 22, when price hit a low of $10.94.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, Saturday’s decline came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a floor at 34.00.
 
The index is currently tracking at 31.79, with the next visible point of support at the 29.90 level.
 
Should the RSI continue to head to this point, it is likely that solana will fall below the $10.94 level, which was last seen four weeks ago.
 
 
Uniswap (UNI)
 
Uniswap (UNI) also moved lower to start the weekend, as the token extended a recent bear run.
 
Following a high of $5.32 on Friday, UNI/USD fell to an intraday low of $5.20 on Christmas Eve.
 
The move led to uniswap landing on its long-term point of support, with bears likely to force a breakout as the weekend matures.
 
 
As of writing, the token remains marginally above its $5.20 floor, and is currently trading at $5.22.
 
Should this floor be broken, a possible target for sellers will possibly be a floor at $4.95, which was last hit in late November.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-nears-17000-ahead-of-christmas-day/"/>
        <updated>2022-12-24T13:17:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose closer to the $17,000 level on Saturday, despite crypto markets mostly consolidating to start the week. The global cryptocurrency market cap is down 0.32% as of writing. Ethereum was also higher earlier in the day, with prices nearing the $1,230 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) remained under the $17,000 level to start the weekend, as prices continued to consolidate despite earlier gains.
 
BTC/USD hit a high of $16,905.22 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after price was at a bottom, at the $16,793.53 mark.
 
The move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency continue to trade above a key point of support at $16,800.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failed to break above a ceiling at 48.00.
 
The index is currently trading at 46.72, with bulls still attempting to push past the aforementioned point of resistance.
 
On the other hand, should price strength decline below a floor at 45.00, bitcoin will likely move towards the $16,000 level.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also consolidated to start the weekend, with prices edging closer to a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $1,216.34 on Friday, ETH/USD raced to a peak of $1,227.00 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of today’s move, ethereum once again attempted to break out of a key ceiling at the $1,230 level.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the breakout did not occur, mainly due to the RSI also remaining below a ceiling of its own at 47.50.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 47.12, with momentum appearing to be bearish as a result of the direction of moving averages (MA).
 
The 10-day (red) MA extended its downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which typically is a sign of price declines.
