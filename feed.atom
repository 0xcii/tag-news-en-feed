Milei Compares Argentine Peso to Excrement
The Argentine peso has plummeted to record lows after presidential candidate Javier Milei railed against the national currency, comparing it to excrement. Milei, projected as the winner in the upcoming elections, declared that citizens should not put their savings in peso-based fixed-term instruments, inviting them to save in dollars during a radio interview.

        <updated>2023-10-12T12:24:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below the $27,000 level on Thursday, ahead of the upcoming inflation report in the United States. Consumer prices are expected to have risen by 3.6% in September, down 0.1% from the month prior. Ethereum plunged to a multi-week low.
 
Bitcoin
 

 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell for a fifth consecutive day, as markets prepared for the release of last month’s U.S. consumer price index (CPI)
 

 
BTC/USD dropped to a low of $26,561.10 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $27,258.45.
 

 
Thursday’s sell-off has seen the world’s largest cryptocurrency remain near its lowest point since the end of September.
 

 

 

 
Looking at the chart, the move pushed the relative strength index (RSI) to a support point at the 44.00 level.
 

 
Price strength has since marginally rebounded, and at the time of writing, is tracking at 45.28.
 

 
This floor may serve as a buffer ahead of the inflation report, which could then trigger an increase in volatility.
 

 

 
Ethereum
 

 
Ethereum (ETH) also experienced a plunge in price, with the cryptocurrency falling to a multi-week low.
 

 
Following a high of $1,576.40 on Wednesday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,538.26 earlier in the session.
 

 
As a result, ethereum has now fallen to its weakest point since September 11, when the price traded below its $1,540 support point.
 

 

 

 
The downtrend comes following a recent crossover of the 10-day (red) moving average and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 

 
Due to this bearish momentum, the RSI has fallen to a current reading of 36.88, which suggests volumes are marginally oversold.
 

 
This could prompt bulls to consider buying the dip, depending on today’s inflation report.

Stablecoins  
Explained
Before  
evaluating their performance in times of market upheaval, it's  
critical to understand what stablecoins represent. Stablecoins are a type  
of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a consistent value. This is  
often accomplished by tying their value to a reserve asset such as a fiat  
currency (for example, USD) or a commodity (for example, gold). This pegging  
technique protects against the significant price volatility seen with other  
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of crypto trading, there are many ways to identify opportunities, one of the most prominent methods being technical analysis. This is the study and general breaking down of charts using various indicators and charting patterns. One such technique is known as Support and Resistance strategy. 
 
Support
 

 
A support, which is also known as a floor, is the lower horizontal line holding up price at a certain level. You can identify a floor by drawing a line in the area you believe the price hits but rarely moves below. A simple strategy some traders use is buying at the floor because they have seen the markets go up each time price hits that level.
 

 

 

 

 
Resistance
 

 
On the other hand, a resistance (upper horizontal line) is the ceiling and reverse of the floor. When the market hits a ceiling, prices fall back down towards the floor. Traders sometimes sell when they see the price has hit a resistance.
 

 

 
Breakout
 

 
Lastly, traders use these lines to identify opportunities for a breakout. A breakout is where both support and resistance is used to anticipate the point where price escapes consolidation. When the markets break out of the resistance traders normally look to buy. When the markets break out of the floor they look to sell. This strategy signals a shift in price momentum in the direction where the breakout takes place.

The "Trezor Safe" line, featuring the Trezor Safe 3 hardware wallet and the limited edition Trezor Safe 3 Bitcoin only model, marks the company's commitment to self-custody in style. In addition, Trezor introduces the "Trezor Keep Family" of metal backup solutions with its three variants of the Trezor Keep Metal.
 
         
         
         
         
    
"Self custody stands on 3 pillars. security, privacy, and usability. But why even bother with self custody?" said Trezor CEO, Matěj Žák. "More than $4 billion worth of bitcoin and altcoins got stolen through all kind of hacks from exchanges and custodians over Bitcoin's existence."
The Trezor Safe 3 hardware wallet promises to offer a secure and user-friendly means for crypto enthusiasts to protect their digital assets. It comes in four colors, making the protection of cryptocurrency both accessible and fashionable. As part of the 10-year anniversary celebration, Trezor also launches the limited edition Trezor Safe 3 Bitcoin only. This exclusive version is tailored for those who are dedicated to Bitcoin, safeguarding the custody of the original cryptocurrency.
The Trezor Keep Metal backup solutions come in three different variants and serve as mistake-proof, convenient solutions for securing recovery seeds. These metal backups help to ensure the safety of critical information, providing peace of mind in the event of hardware wallet loss or damage.
These hardware wallets aim to ease the transition to self-custody for both newcomers and novices in the world of Bitcoin. "Everything we can possible do in an open source way, we do it," Žák continued. "We are here to make crypto security easy for everyone."
