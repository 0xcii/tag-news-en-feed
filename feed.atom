The report explores the historical pattern of Bitcoin’s (BTC) performance following halving events that occur approximately every four years. Furthermore, the report estimates that the next halving event could occur around April 2024.
 
The Cyclical Nature Of Crypto Markets
 
Per the report, Bitcoin, the dominant cryptocurrency, is a barometer for the overall crypto market. One distinctive feature of Bitcoin is its halving process, which creates scarcity and helps maintain its value.

Although Tesla has not bought any Bitcoin since February 2021, even selling 75% of its holdings in April 2022 at a loss, the technology firm has chosen not to sell despite recent market gyrations. By November 2021, prices soared to over $69,000 but fell months later to $16,000 in 2022.
 
 
In February 2021, Tesla bought $1.5 billion of Bitcoin, acquiring around 43,000 BTC. Around the same time, the automaker said it would accept the coin for payment before reneging on its comments weeks later.
