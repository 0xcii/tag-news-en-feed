Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has defended its “too tough” approach to  
registering cryptocurrency firms, arguing that robust standards are essential  
for building a sustainable and trustworthy digital asset sector.
In a  
statement released today (Monday), Val Smith, Head of Payments and Digital  
Assets at the FCA's authorizations division, addressed criticism that the  
regulator's stringent requirements could potentially stifle innovation in the  
crypto industry and that the bar for registration is set “too high.”
Crypto Companies Want to

The dialogue unfolded when an attendee, seemingly a supporter, asked Musk: “Do you envision the XRP Ledger being incorporated into financial institutions in the future?”
 
He responded thoughtfully: “I do think that cryptocurrency is an interesting and probably valuable bulwark against centralized control.” Musk, who has to be careful what he says in public due to his reach and popularity, apparently tried to avoid any misunderstandings and interpretations, which is why he clarified further, “this is definitely not an endorsement or lack of endorsement for XRP.”

It’s now a hotly debated election issue, dividing the electorate and promising to bring the industry to new heights. And we’re not just talking about the US elections and Trump’s pro-crypto stance; digital currency as an election issue has spilled over to Japan, where it’s scheduled to hold its general elections this October 27th.
 
 
Yuichiro Tamaki, the leader of the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), has recently promised tax cuts and reforms as part of the party’s efforts to shore up support.

The ECB’s paper, titled “The Distributional Consequences of Bitcoin,” authored by Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf, has ignited a fervent response from the BTC community.
 
The ECB’s paper challenges the foundational premise of Bitcoin by arguing that its appreciation does not contribute to the productive capacity of the economy. Instead, the paper posits that a sustained increase in BTC’s value leads to redistributive effects, where the consumption and wealth accumulation of early holders potentially impoverish non-holders and latecomers.
