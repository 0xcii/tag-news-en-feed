        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) has been a major player in the cryptocurrency market, attracting a significant number of investors with its high-speed transactions and robust ecosystem.

For the short-term trend to change, prices must peel back the losses of September 1. At the same time, the leg up must be with expanding trading volume.
 
Currently, Bitcoin might be steady. However, the accompanying engagement, looking at the September 2 bar, is light. 
 
What’s required is a sharp uptick in trading volume to assuage fears and assure optimistic traders that buyers are back in the picture.

Specifically, the birth of the Industrial Workers of the World and a group called the Wobblies, a nickname given to IWW Members. At its peak, the IWW had over 150,000 members in 1917, with global memberships and significant power and influence. While the IWW was a socialist leaning organization in theory, many of its core values were intertwined into the DNA of the American Labor movement, and was undeniably pivotal to the development of organized labor and a strong working class following the industrial revolution. The parallels between some of the IWW’s origins and ideologies and Bitcoin are significant, and shall be demonstrated with quotes rather than boring you to death with in depth history.

Following weeks of massive volatility and corrections, SOL is now trading above a crucial support level—a monthly liquidity zone that could be key to its future price action.
