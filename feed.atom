        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elon Musk has rediscovered his love for Dogecoin (DOGE) in recent weeks. After the Twitter CEO temporarily made the Shiba Inu – the mascot of the meme coin – the logo of the social media platform, Musk is now causing a stir in the Dogecoin community with a new bet.
 
Musk has offered via Twitter a reward of 1 million DOGE, the equivalent of about $83,500, to anyone who can prove that he owns an emerald mine. The bet comes after Twitter account DogeDesigner (@cb_doge), popular in the Dogecoin community, claimed that Elon Musk never owned an emerald mine.
 
“An open offer of 69,420 DOGE to all the media outlets who are publishing false information. Send me a proof of its existence & take your DOGE,” wrote the influencer, with whom the billionaire has communicated frequently in recent weeks. …]]></summary>

once-collapsed FTX cryptocurrency exchange has recovered $7.3 billion in liquid  
digital assets and cash. Since January, this figure has increased by $800  
million, according to a statement by the company's lawyer, Andy Dietderich, who  
testified on Wednesday before the American Bankruptcy Court.
FTX Benefits from Rising  
Crypto Prices
Dietderich  
admitted that the value of recovered assets would have been $1 billion lower if  
not for the strong growth of cryptocurrencies since the beginning of the year.  
For example, Bitcoin (BTC), the largest and oldest digital asset, has gained  
over 80% in the past three months.
Part of the  
recovered funds came from a deal with Modulo Capital to raise $400 million in

"Beginning June 2nd, you will no longer be able to transact from your Paxos account, aside from withdrawing your funds," Paxos stated.  

Strict Crypto Regulations in Canada  

Though the company did not cite any reason behind the sudden move, the new Canadian laws for cryptocurrency businesses might have played a role. The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) issued an order in February mandating all crypto companies to register before a March 24 deadline.
