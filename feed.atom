        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon was a notable mover on Tuesday, as the token surged by as much as 8% in today’s session. The move saw the cryptocurrency hit a one-month high, following a recent five-day bull run. Solana also rose higher, following a sell-off to start the week.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) rose by as much as 8% earlier in today’s session, hitting a one-month high in the process.
 
Following a low of $0.7033 earlier in the day, MATIC/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $0.7473 on Tuesday.
 
As a result of this surge, MATIC hit its highest point since June 9, which is the last time the token broke out of a ceiling at $0.7480.
 
 
MATIC bulls were unable to breach this ceiling in today’s session, with the price retreating from an earlier high.
 
This comes despite the relative strength index (RSI) marginally breaking out of a ceiling at 59.00, with a current reading of 59.31.
 
In the event the index continues to strengthen, the odds of a breakout above $0.7480 will greatly increase.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
After dropping by nearly 7% to start the week, solana (SOL) bulls moved to buy the dip, with price now closing in on a fresh multi-month high.
 
SOL/USD jumped to a high of $22.29 earlier in the day, which is less than 24 hours after almost falling below $20.00.
 
Tuesday’s peak sees the world’s ninth largest cryptocurrency $0.20 away from a recent two-month high at $22.49.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it seems that traders reentered the market after the RSI hit a support level at 65.00
 
As of writing, price strength is at a reading of 69.05, with the next visible resistance zone at 72.00.
 
Should today’s momentum extend throughout the week, there is a good chance that solana will climb past $23.00.

Polygon Network Growth Has Been Steadily Rising Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, MATIC addresses are being created at an increasingly faster rate. The relevant indicator here is the “network growth,” which measures the total amount of new Polygon addresses that are coming online on the blockchain.
 
New addresses may be considered analogous to new users coming into the network, so this metric can provide us with hints about how the adoption of the cryptocurrency is coming along.
 
When the value of the indicator is high, it means that a large number of new addresses are being created on the network right now. Naturally, th…]]></summary>

However, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India’s external affairs minister, said India isn’t interested in issuing a common BRICS currency. Instead, he said India is more concerned with strengthening the rupee.

On July 6, 2023, more than $125 million worth of different cryptocurrencies were lost to this attack. Almost $120 million of that figure came from Multichain’s Fantom bridge, with the remaining coming from the Dogecoin, Moonriver, Kava, and Conflux bridges. Assets removed from the cross-chain protocol include wrapped Ether (wETH), wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), USDC, and USDT.
 
However, contrary to popular beliefs of an outside attack, blockchain analytics company Chainalysis believes this multi-million dollar exploit could have been a hack or rug pull orchestrated by insiders, due in part to Multichain’s recent is…]]></summary>

When the value of this metric is high, it means that holders are moving around a significant number of coins on the network. Such a trend is generally a sign that the traders are actively participating in the market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion by Thabo P. Ncube, a Bitcoiner who lived through Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation in 2008.
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the fiat custodian and lender of last resort in the country, recently “liberalized” its much-vaunted foreign exchange auction trading system in hopes of selling foreign currencies at market-determined exchange rates through regulated banks.
Zimbabwe uses a multi-currency system, with 80% of its economy being dollarized, according to economists. The black-market rate for the U.S. dollar (USD) has recently been twice as high or even higher than the official rate backed by the RBZ.
In January 2023, the local Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL) was trading at about ZWL$705 to $1, but on June 7, 2023, just after the bank’s pivot, the official price was about ZWL$4,868 t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum moved briefly above the $1,900 level on Tuesday, as the U.S. dollar weakened versus several G7 currencies. The biggest fall came versus the British pound, with USD/GBP hitting a 15-month low. Bitcoin also rose higher, climbing past $31,000 earlier in the day. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved back above the $31,000 level in today’s session, as the U.S. dollar weakened across the board.
 
BTC/USD surged to an intraday peak of $31,026.08 earlier in today’s session, which comes after dropping to a low of $30,156.54 on Monday.
 
Price has since slipped, dropping as volatility in the market remains high ahead of tomorrow’s inflation report from the United States.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to jump past a ceiling at 61.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 58.96, with the next visible point of support at 55.00.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average has edged even closer to its 25-day (blue) counterpart, increasing the chances of a downturn.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) briefly rose over the $1,900 zone in today’s session, after nearly falling below $1,800 in recent days.
 
After hitting a low of $1,860.62 to start the week, ETH/USD rallied to a high of $1,905.46 on Tuesday.
 
However, like bitcoin, ethereum has since shifted lower, as the cryptocurrency consolidated for a fifth straight session.
 
 
As of writing, ETH is trading at $1,870.15, with the RSI at a reading of 50.43, which is marginally below a ceiling at 51.00.
 
In the event the index is able to rise above the 51.00 zone, there is a strong possibility that ethereum will be back over $1,900.

Masroofi, the Egyptian fintech focused on electronic payment services for children, recently raised $1.5 million via an investment funding round. The raised capital is expected to fund the fintech startup’s operational and expansion activities. According to a report, Masroofi was able to raise $1.5 million after the company’s directors reportedly rejected funding from investors in the “Shark Tank” program.
 
As explained in the African Heroes report, the unnamed participants in Masroofi’s investment round were drawn by the fintech’s focus on the 20 million Egyptian youth aged between five and 20. The track records as well as the rapport between the fintech startups’ co-founders are the other factors that had a positive influence on investors.
 

 
Meanwhile, the report revealed that Masroofi is hoping to reach two million young people within five years. The fintech is also reportedly aiming to grow with its young customers by catering for their evolving needs through the provision of product offerings such as neo banking services.
 
While the co-founders Mostafa Abdel-Khabeer and Sayed Hosni are said to be confident of the fintech sector’s capacity to continue leading Egypt’s startup market, the Africa Heroes report suggested that there is still room for improvement. The report identified Egypt’s remittances and installment payments market as areas which can be bolstered by emerging financial technologies.
