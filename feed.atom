This is also supported by the fact that the meme coin could soon experience a trend reversal from the current downtrend that it is experiencing.

Data from the market intelligence platform Santiment shows that Dogecoin’s 30-day MVRV ratio is around -15%, meaning many Dogecoin holders are currently at a loss. This negative MVRV ratio also signals a bottom for the meme coin, which usually ushers in a period of accumulation since the crypto token is currently undervalued.

How These Solana Meme Coin Traders Turned $6,400 Into $8 Million
 
On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) that these traders turned $6,400 into $8 million by investing in $TIM, a meme coin on Solana. 2 newly created wallets were said to have used 44.78 to buy 526.6 million $TIM (52.665 of the token’s total supply) within three minutes of launch.
