To some, the rivalry may seem like a mere culture war within the crypto community. However at its’ root, it's a reflection of distinct foundational beliefs resulting in divergence.
Let's delve deeper into these foundational beliefs:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, the payment giant Paypal announced that the stablecoin PYUSD is now available on Venmo. Paypal detailed that the stablecoin asset will be available to select Venmo users and fully roll out for all users “in the coming weeks.”
 
Paypal Stablecoin PYUSD Makes Its Way to Venmo
 
Paypal has disclosed that Venmo users can now leverage the firm’s proprietary stablecoin, PYUSD. The rollout is starting with select Venmo users, but soon all Venmo customers will be able to “able to purchase PYUSD and send it to friends and family on Paypal, Venmo, and compatible external wallets.”
 
The company notes that transfers between Paypal users and Venmo are “fast and free,” with the exception of blockchain network fees. PYUSD is an ERC20 token, which means the coin is subject to fees associated with the Ethereum fee market and block space.
 
For example, etherscan.io indicates that the cost to transfer an ERC20 token on September 20, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. (ET), ranges from $2.65 to $2.91 per transaction. Paypal further mentions in the announcement that PYUSD is now available on various platforms, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Kraken, MetaMask, Ledger, Phantom, Bitpay, and Fireblocks, among others.
 
The payments company also highlights its recent approval by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The latest development comes on the heels of PYUSD’s first transparency report, which unveiled the backing of cash and U.S. Treasury reverse repurchase agreements as reserves.
 
 
As of September 20, approximately 44.37 million PYUSD coins are in circulation. A total of 698 distinct addresses currently hold PYUSD, with these wallets collectively executing 3,354 transfers since the currency’s launch. Additionally, the top 100 holders jointly possess 99.96% of the PYUSD supply, equivalent to 44,358,474.05 PYUSD tokens.

"I want to prove to you that I know a message that hashes to a given hash value using the SHA-1 hash. I don't want to reveal anything about the message to you. It's a zero-knowledge proof, and I've written a program to do this that I'll tell you about," Finney says in the introduction.

Bitcoin Percent Supply On Exchanges Has Dropped To 11.8%
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, the BTC exchange supply is back to its year-to-date (YTD) lows. The relevant metric here is the “percent balance on exchanges,” which keeps track of the total percentage of the Bitcoin supply that’s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this indicator goes up, it means that the investors are depositing a net amount of the cryptocurrency into these platforms. As one of the main reasons why investors make such transfers is for selling purposes, this kind of trend can carry potential bearish effects for the coin.
