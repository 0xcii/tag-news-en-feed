        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE, 1:35pm, 9/13/2023 - A PayPal spokesperson says its infrastructure partner Paxos was responsible for the overpayment: “Paxos overpaid the BTC network fee on Sept. 10, 2023. This only impacted Paxos corporate operations. Paxos clients and end users have not been affected and all customer funds are safe. This was due to a bug on a single transfer and it has been fixed. Paxos is in contact with the miner to recoup the funds.”
In a surprising turn of events, PayPal, the global online payments giant, reportedly overpaid a staggering $510,750 on a Bitcoin transaction fee. The incident, initially thought to be a "fat-fingered" mistake, has now been traced back to an issue within PayPal's processing system, according to a report by Mempool's Mononautical.

Ethereumpow (ETHW) now trades at a price less than 1% of the U.S. dollar value of ether. The team behind the Ethereum proof-of-work network acknowledged in March that the protocol’s prospects may not be as bright as they were in September 2022.
 
ETHW’s Gradual Decline
 
Almost a year after it debuted at just over $100, ethereumpow (ETHW), the native coin of the breakaway Ethereum proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, traded at $1.32 on Sept. 13, 2023. At this price, the coin is down by more than 95% from its maiden price. In contrast, the main Ethereum blockchain’s native coin ETH, w…]]></summary>

the District of Delaware has granted crypto exchange FTX permission to sell,  
invest, and hedge its crypto holdings, valued at over $3.4 billion, to settle  
outstanding debts. 
This ruling comes after FTX's legal team filed a request for  
authorization to engage in the sale of the digital assets, citing the benefits  
of hedging crypto assets and generating returns from staking certain digital  
assets for the estates and creditors.
Judge John Dorsey presided over the court hearing, where he not only approved the motion but also overruled objections raised by two parties opposing the plan. This pivotal decision allows FTX to initiate the process of selling, staking, and hedging its substantial crypto holdings.
