of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)'s crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, took the stand to  
testify against him on the second day of her appearance today (Wednesday). Her  
testimony revealed aspects of SBF’s character, who faces allegations of fraud

In a report by Reuters, Ellison described SBF as a  
"utilitarian" who believed that the only moral rule that mattered was  
doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people. She further stated  
that he didn't think basic rules like "don't lie" or "don't

an environment where people around him felt comfortable doing what they knew
