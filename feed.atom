        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the XRP lawsuit, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has countered Ripple Labs’s recent motion to strike the declaration of SEC summary witness Andrea Fox. The agency’s filing asserts that the testimony is permissible as summary evidence under federal law, not requiring expert disclosure as claimed by Ripple.
 
The SEC’s motion, directed to Judge Sarah Netburn, underscores that the Fox Declaration is a “standard summary evidence permissible under Fed. R. Evid. 1006,” which aims to aid the court by providing straightforward arithmetic calculations based on Ripple’s financial records. The SEC’s motion states that “It is not an expert’s report, does not rely on specialized expertise, and does not render any opinions at all, let alone an ‘expert’ one.”

The Hashrate measures the computing power that the miners have attached to the Bitcoin network. This metric is measured in terms of hashes per second, or, in the much bigger and more practical unit these days, exahashes per second (EH/s).
