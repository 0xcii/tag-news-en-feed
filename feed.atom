Bitcoin, the flagship digital asset, surpassed the $40,000 mark, hitting its  
highest level in the last 18 months. This surge is attributed to a combination

Bitcoin's ascent was notable, crossing the $41,600 threshold, reflecting a  
more than 5% increase in the past 24 hours. Analysts are quick to highlight
