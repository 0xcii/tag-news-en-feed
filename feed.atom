        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin snapped a recent bear run on Tuesday, as cryptocurrency prices moved marginally higher. The token was up by nearly 3% in today’s session, ending a six-day losing streak in the process. Chainlink was also in the green, as it rebounded from a key support point.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) snapped a six-day losing streak on Tuesday, as prices rose by as much as 3%.
 
LTC/USD moved away from a one-month low of $61.00, hitting a high of $65.60 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move came as bullish pressure intensified once the token hit a key support point of $63.50.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also rose, moving away from its long-term floor of 33.50.
 
Since moving away from yesterday’s six-month low, the index is now tracking at the 37.46 mark.
 
The next visible resistance seems to be the 46.00 level, and if hit, LTC will likely be trading above $70.00.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) was another notable gainer in today’s session, as prices surged to a four-day high.
 
Following a low of $5.75 to start the week, LINK/USD climbed to a peak of $6.10 earlier today.
 
This rally has pushed the token to its highest point since Friday, when it was trading at a top of $6.54.
 
 
Similar to litecoin, today’s move saw prices move away from a four-week low, rising from a recent floor in the process.
 
LINK rallied at the $5.80 support, which came as the RSI rose above a ceiling at the 37.00 level.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 39.81, with LINK/USD trading at $6.06.

$1.7 Million Leave Dormant Addresses
 
The collapse of the QuadrigaCX exchange, Canada’s largest exchange at the time, saw a lot of users lose their money. While the majority of the losses were attributed to mismanagement by funder Gerald Cotten, a good portion of it was actually because the wallets of QuadrigaCX were said to be inaccessible as it was believed that he had taken the private keys to the grave with him after his death in 2018. However, much of what was believed has now been turned on its head as five wallets…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The deal will involve NYDIG taking ownership of miners, with the aim to lessen chances of a bankruptcy.
Greenidge Generation, a bitcoin miner operating in New York, has reached a restructuring agreement for the $74.4 million debt with its lender, NYDIG.
The restructuring will involve NYDIG purchasing 2.8 exahash per second (EH/s) of Greenidge’s bitcoin miners, which Greenidge will host for NYDIG. This would eliminate $57-$68 million of debt, leaving Greenidge with approximately 1.8 EH/s of its own miners, while requiring that the mining firm also pledge the rest of its unencumbered assets to secure the remainder of the loan.
According to the released term sheet, “The Company’s average monthly cash burn rate during October and November 2022 was approximately $8 million, of which approximately $5.5 million per month was associated with principal and interest payments to NYDIG. Further, the Company expects to have a similar cash burn, and similar payments to NYDIG, during December 2022.”
Previously, Greenidge began sounding the alarm in regards to their financial standing due to the amount of cash they were burning, indicating that at such a speed they would run out of money by March 2023. 
Bitcoin miners have been hit hard with old bull market orders getting fulfilled and new contributions to increasing hash rate, all while the price of bitcoin held by the miners plummets. In effect, they mined high and sold low.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum rose back above the $1,200 level on Tuesday, as the dollar rebounded following the latest Bank of Japan (BOJ) policy decision. The bank adjusted its yield curve control, which increased its cap on the 10-year government bond, allowing moves of up to 50 basis points (bps), up from 25 bps. Bitcoin also rose on the news, climbing closer to $17,000
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved closer to the $17,000 level on Tuesday, as traders reacted to the latest Bank of Japan policy decision.
 
BTC/USD surged to a peak of $16,837.65 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after hitting a low of $16,398.14.
 
Today’s move saw the token climb above a key resistance level of $16,700, with prices rising to a four-day high in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at the 46.00 level.
 
As of writing, the index is currently tracking at the 46.61 mark, which is its strongest point since last Thursday.
 
Should the index continue this upward trend, we will likely see BTC move above the $17,000 level in the coming days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also trended higher on Tuesday, as it once again rose into the $1,200 region.
 
Following a low of $1,160.38 to start the week, ETH/USD raced to a peak of $1,214.73 earlier in the day.
 
This comes despite the fact that there has been a recent downward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
 
As of writing, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency seems set to collide with a higher resistance at the $1,230 level.
 
This could prove to be challenging however, with the 14-day RSI now hovering directly below a ceiling at 47.00.
 
Should there be a break of this key threshold, we will likely see more ETH bulls reenter the market.

Shiba Inu Countdown Ends With New Update For Official Website
 
A few days back, a mysterious countdown appeared on the official SHIB website, making the community speculate what it may be leading towards. Many users suggested that the announcement could be related to the upcoming Shibarium upgrade for the meme coin.
 
“Shibarium” is a layer-2 blockchain solution for Shiba Inu that plans to bring several improvements to the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem. A layer-2 solution is typically a secondary blockchain built on another network (the “layer 1”) that takes the load off the main chain by first performing its transactions separately, and then sending …]]></summary>
