        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent developments in the Bitcoin mining industry suggest a significant financial squeeze due to decreased network fees and halved block rewards.
 
These factors are shaping the economic space for companies validating Bitcoin transactions and could potentially force some into selling their digital assets prematurely to remain solvent, according to Kaiko Research.
 
 
Diminishing Rewards And Revenue Pressures
 
Kaiko Research has pointed out this worrying trend for Bitcoin miners: the combination of reduced mining rewards and lower network fees is increasingly challenging their profitability. Since April, when the reward for mining a Bitcoin block was cut from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, revenue has plummeted.

Expectations are that the completion of the hard fork will bring about an ADA price rally that could send it toward its previous all-time high of $3.1. However, the question remains of whether the expected rally will be as momentous as the 2021 rally that followed the Alonzo Hard Fork.
 
The Legendary 2021 Cardano Rally
 
In 2021, the Cardano Alonzo Hard Fork was one of the most important events in the crypto market, with the expectation of smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities finally debuting on the network. This expectation caused the price to surge as a result.

There Is Oversupply In Bitcoin: Will Prices Fall?
 
Not everyone is convinced that the uptrend will last, at least based on on-chain activities. Taking to X, one analyst pointed to developments in the Bitcoin spent volume lifespan chart. There, the analyst noted a 10X increase in BTC movements compared to previous highs. 
 
 
The massive influx, amounting to a staggering $9 billion, coincides with Mt. Gox’s planned user compensation in July, initially slated for October. The analyst says the concern with this deluge is that it could trigger a sell-off, further driving prices down.
