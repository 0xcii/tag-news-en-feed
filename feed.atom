        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since reaching its all-time high in March 2024, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) has faltered, failing to sustain a steady upward momentum and dampening investors’ expectations for a major bull rally following its halving event. However, a crypto analyst is offering a glimmer of hope, encouraging investors to remain patient despite the market downtrend, as the next few months could present a bullish turnaround for Bitcoin. 
 
A Ray Of Hope For Crypto Investors
 
As said by many crypto analysts, the month of September is historically a difficult period for Bitcoin, characterized by severe downward momentum, volatility and instability. Rekt Capital, a crypto analyst, told his over 500,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin’s price has plummeted by approximately 8% this September.

Exchanges Received Large Stablecoin Deposits Ahead Of Bitcoin Rally
 
In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed about the significant stablecoin net inflows into exchanges that have occurred recently.
 
The indicator of relevance here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which keeps track of the net amount of a given coin or group of coins that’s moving into or out of the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. The metric’s value is simply calculated by subtracting the outflows from the inflows.

Cryptocurrency trader and investor Daan Crypto made an interesting observation about Bitcoin’s open interest and the asset’s price action. In a post published on X, the crypto trader noted that Bitcoin’s open interest lags behind the asset’s price. 
 
 
According to the post, while the BTC price is up 8.69% from its recent lows, the commensurate open interest is up 5.50%. The difference in the rise of BTC price and open interest could have multiple implications regarding the market’s health.
