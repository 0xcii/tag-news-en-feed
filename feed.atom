        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) annual enforcement report for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, detailing the filing of 784 enforcement actions, orders for nearly $5 billion in financial remedies, and distribution of nearly $1 billion to harmed investors, has sparked a fervent response from the XRP community.
 
SEC Chair Gary Gensler emphasized the significance of the Enforcement Division’s role in investor protection, asserting, “The investing public benefits from the Enforcement Division’s work as a cop on the beat. FY 2023’s results demonstrate the Division’s effectiveness—working alongside colleagues throughout SEC—in following the facts & the law wherever they lead to hold wrongdoers accountable.”

        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/blockchaincom-banks-110-million-valuation-cut-to-half/"/>
        <updated>2023-11-15T10:20:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain.com has become the latest crypto company to see a valuation cut in its latest $110 million Series-E funding round. According to Bloomberg, the company was valued at less than half its last $14 billion valuation. However, the official announcement did not reveal the current valuation.
Another Funding Round of Blockchain.com
 United Kingdom-based venture capital firm Kingsway Capital, an existing investor in Blochchian.com, led the latest funding round. Other companies participating in the round include Baillie Gifford, Lakestar, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Coinbase Ventures.
After the latest round, Blockchain.com is adding the Founder and CEO of Kingsway, Manny Stotz, and Lakestar’s Partner, Nicolas Brand, to its board.
Blockchain.com was established in 2011 as a crypto wallet platform. It later added crypto exchange services and has grown into a major platform. According to the company, nearly 33 percent of all Bitcoin transactions are made through Blockchain.com-managed wallets. Its website shows over 90 million Blockchain.com wallets were created with 40 million verified users. Over $1 trillion worth of crypto assets were transacted through Blockchain.com.
Valuation Takes a Massive Dent
In its previous funding round closed last year in March, Blockchain.com was valued at $14 billion. The company was valued at $5.2 billion a year before when it raised $300 million. The crypto company has raised $600 million to date, as seen on Crunchbase.
Meanwhile, Blockchain.com is expanding its global reach. In recent years, it has received regulatory approvals in several jurisdictions, including Singapore and Dubai. It is also operating in many other countries with local licenses.
Despite the developments, the company also witnessed some setbacks. It had a massive exposure to 3AC, as it loaned the collapsed company about $270 million. The company further laid off 25 percent of its staff, about 150 employees, last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bitcoin-owning Swedish couple was recently the latest victim of robbers that appear to target prominent bitcoin and crypto personalities. One social media user said the spate of robberies may be linked to Sweden’s antiquated privacy laws which make it easy for criminals to obtain tax records and residence details of targeted individuals.
 
Victims Publicly Associated With Bitcoin
 
The robbers, who appear to target prominent Swedish bitcoin and crypto personalities, recently descended on the Stockholm residence of a middle-aged bitcoin-owning couple. According to a report in Aftonbladet, the four robbers physically assaulted, tied up, and even used knives to threaten the couple. The report added that one victim of the robbery had to be ferried to the hospital via ambulance helicopter.

Aurelien Michel, a French citizen and the brains behind the Mutant Ape Planet nonfungible token (NFT) collection, has entered a plea of guilt on charges of wire fraud in a New York court, reports disclose Wednesday, referencing the statement from the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York.
 
Michel’s creation, the Mutant Ape Planet collection, proved to be an illicit mimicry of Yuga Labs’ Mutant Ape Yacht Club initiative. Michel orchestrated a scheme that swindled investors out of a staggering $3 million in connection with the fraudulent collection.

Wood described a significant shift in the SEC’s response to Ark Invest’s ETF filings, contrasting their current engagement with previous experiences. “We had put in a number of times a filing and we were just denied. Never got any questions, really never got any response. This time, this summer, we got questions back from the SEC,” she noted.
