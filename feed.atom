Maker MVRV Ratio Has Registered A Surge In Recent Days
 
The past month has been great for Maker investors, as the asset’s value has gained a whopping 86% during this period. MKR hasn’t slowed down recently, either, as the coin has only continued to show sharp bullish momentum.
 

 
 
As it currently stands, Maker’s profits in the past week mean that it is the best-performing coin among at least the top 100 assets in the cryptocurrency space. This constant rise that the asset has seen recently, however, may be coming to an end.
 
According to an analyst on Twitter, the MKR investors are currently holding onto a large amount of profits, which may …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit Friday against Richard Schueler, known as Richard Heart, and his companies Hex, Pulsechain, and Pulsex, alleging they raised more than $1 billion through unregistered securities offerings.
 
SEC Lawsuit Accuses Richard Heart of Running Unregistered Securities Offerings
 
The SEC complaint alleges that beginning in December 2019, Heart offered and sold Hex tokens and promised investors incentives and bonuses while marketing Hex as a high-yield blockchain certificate of deposit. Between December 2019 and November 2020, Heart accepted more than $678 million worth of ether from investors in exchange for Hex tokens, the complaint states. The SEC lawsuit states:
 

Through their actions, defendants Heart and Pulsechain violated, and unless enjoined will continue to violate, the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.
 
Additionally, the complaint alleges that between July 2021 and April 2022, Heart conducted unregistered offerings of investments called Pulsechain and Pulsex, allegedly urging investors to deposit crypto assets into public wallet addresses in exchange for tokens that would be delivered in the future. SEC highlights that more than $354 million was invested in Pulsechain and more than $676 million in Pulsex in this fashion, according to the complaint.
 
 
The SEC states that the offerings from Hex, Pulsechain, and Pulsex were securities offerings that were not properly registered. Furthermore, the complaint alleges that Heart and Pulsechain defrauded investors by misappropriating at least $12.1 million to pay for Heart’s personal luxury purchases including a 555-carat diamond, luxury watches, and cars rather than for developing the Pulsechain network as promised. The SEC is seeking to bring this case to trial.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu remained close to a two-month high to start the week, as sentiment in the meme coin remained mostly bullish on Monday. This comes despite the global cryptocurrency market cap mostly consolidating in today’s session. Bitcoin cash was another notable exception, as the price rose by over 4%.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was close to a two-month high on Monday, as momentum in the meme coin remained bullish.
 
Following a low of $0.000008171 on Sunday, SHIB/USD jumped to an intraday high of $0.000008688 earlier today.
 
This has pushed SHIB close to its highest point since May 29, when price peaked at $0.000008888.
 
 
Monday’s move came as the relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a recent support point at the 60.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 64.41, with the next visible point of resistance at 68.00.
 
Should it reach this point, SHIB will likely hit a ceiling of $0.00000885.
 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Another notable gainer on Monday was bitcoin cash (BCH), which rose by as much as 4% to start the week.
 
BCH/USD peaked at $258.30 earlier in today’s session, following on from Sunday’s low at $243.34.
 
The move saw the cryptocurrency continue to trade near yesterday’s two-week high at the $266.29 point.
 
 
Earlier gains have since slipped however, as price strength collided with a resistance level at 56.00.
 
Currently the RSI is at a reading of 53.23, and appears to be heading for a floor around the 50.00 zone.
 
A destination of $240.00 may be the target for bears should this decline continue.

The discovery of a covert mining operation was made possible through a tip-off from the public, and it sheds light on the challenges faced by energy suppliers and law enforcement in combating the growing issue of electricity theft for cryptocurrency mining.
 
 
The recent operation in Miri, spearheaded by Sarawak Energy, resulted in the seizure of 34 cryptocurrency mining servers that were found to be tapping into the local grid and utilizing approximately 6,000 Malaysian ringgits ($1300) worth of stolen electricity each month.
