On Tuesday, July 2, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell conveyed cautious optimism about recent inflation data but reiterated the need for sustained improvement before considering rate cuts.

The Fed’s primary inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, has shown a decline, rising by 2.6% over the past year, down from about 4% a year ago.
