Internet Computer Has Become Most Developed Crypto Project In Past Month
 
In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared the latest standings of cryptocurrency projects based on the criterion of “Development Activity.”

One way to gauge this work is through the number of “commits” on the repository. A commit is a record of any change made on the repository. However, this method has a problem, and it’s the fact that commits are inheritable.
