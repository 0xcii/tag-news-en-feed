Ripple CTO On Missing Genesis Block
 
Schwartz took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to address the issues behind the XRP ledger’s missing genesis block. He revealed his insights in response to questions from a community member about the XRP ledger’s atypical beginning at block 32,569.
 
The community member, known as MetaMan, expressed doubt and underscored how crucial transparency is to holders of XRP, and he requested that the Ripple CTO confirm if there is “any other blockchain that lost its genesis block.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple  
has temporarily halted its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) due to  
what is described as a 'hostile' regulatory environment in the United States.  
The delay is attributed to the ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and  
Exchange Commission (SEC).
IPO  
Plans Deferred amid US Regulatory Challenges
Ripple,  
the blockchain-based firm behind the cryptocurrency XRP, had previously  
expressed its intention to explore a public listing once the SEC lawsuit,  
initiated in 2020, concluded. However, the regulatory challenges faced by the  
company in the U.S. prompted it to explore alternative jurisdictions with  
clearer regulatory frameworks.

Under the restructuring terms, the company’s existing shareholders will receive 60 percent of the new equity in common stock and warrants. The approval of the restructuring followed the closure of a proposed $55 million equity rights offering e…]]></summary>

SEC Seeks Trial Delay Amid Cooperation
 
Just days after a judge firmly rejected motions to reconsider earlier orders, the SEC, in a surprising move, requested a “modest adjournment” to accommodate Kwon’s extradition proceedings. This comes despite previous uncertainty surrounding Do Kwon’s presence, facing criminal charges in the US and South Korea alongside his ongoing detainment in Montenegro.
