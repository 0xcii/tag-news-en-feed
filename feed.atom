Musk further added that the deletions would be obvious accounts that have no tweets or they haven’t logged in for years. However, after Musk announced this plan, a great number of cryptocurrency proponents have grown concerned that Hal Finney’s account would be among the purged names.

Bucharest, Romania,12/12/22, Chainwire:
 
After experiencing success in the crypto space, DeFi Yield Protocol announces a complete rebranding to Dypius. The experienced team conducted several months’ worth of research to come up with the best way to represent what they had evolved into over the years. Dypius has the suffix of the nebulae in the galaxy. Nebulas are the formations of gas, dust, and other materials that “clump” together to form denser regions in the universe. They attract further matter and eventually become dense enough to form stars, planets, and planetary system objects. Dypius is the place of creation of stars, planets, and life. This is Dypius, a place to create and shape the future!

South Korean authorities continue their search and have already gone as far as invalidating Kwon’s passport but he continues to be elusive. This time around, authorities believe that they may have located where the founder is currently hiding and are reportedly working with the Serbian government to get him back to South Korea.
 
Do Kwon Is In Serbia?
 
The South Korean prosecutors have seemingly been following Do Kwon around the world. Previously, authorities had said that they believed that Kwon was in Dubai. However, they now believe that the Terra founder made his way to Serbia from Dubai last month.

Several parts of Cuba have experienced repeated blackouts, which have made mining rigs in Cuba unsustainable and even impossible in certain cases.
 
This has caused many Cubans to lose thousands of dollars that they had invested in procuring crypto-mining equipment and graphics cards. The constant electricity blackouts have led to consistent interruptions to the mining hardware, which has hindered the potential income of the operators.
 
Reportedly, Cuban citizens have been experiencing electricity blackouts that extend for more than 10 hours a day. Furthermore, meteorological events such as Hurricane Ian have rendered the country’s electric power plants less than optimal…]]></summary>
