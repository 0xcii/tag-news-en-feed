        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of Celsius, pleaded not guilty to charges of misleading customers and artificially inflating the CEL token shortly after being arrested on Thursday. Following this, he was released on bail by a US District Judge on a bond of $40 million.
 
According to a court document filed on Thursday, the personal recognizance bond for Alex Mashinsky is secured by his Manhattan residence, as well as the signatures of his wife and another individual.
 
Benjamin Alee and Jonathan Ohring are the attorneys representing Alex Mashinsky, and in a statement, Ohring mentioned that Mashinsky is eager to defend himself in court against what he believes are unfounded charges.
