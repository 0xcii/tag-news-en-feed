Holding strong above the $60,000 mark, BTC is making strides toward new highs as the entire crypto market anticipates a potential rally in the coming weeks.

The recent price action suggests that the six-month accumulation phase may soon end, prompting speculation about a significant upward movement. Investors and analysts closely watch these developments and are eager to see if BTC can sustain this momentum.
