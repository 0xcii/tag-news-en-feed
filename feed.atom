In a post on X, one analyst, while citing CryptoQuant data, notes that since the beginning of 2024, the total BTC balance held by miners has grown by a staggering 12,100 BTC, reaching a total of 217,000 BTC. 
 
This behavior starkly contrasts with what happened in 2016 and 2020 before the network slashed miner rewards. Then, reading from data, most miners were sizing down their holdings in anticipation of possible revenue slumps post-Halving. 
 
 
Halving is set at the protocol level and slashes miner block rewar…]]></summary>

As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post pointed out, the total Bitcoin inflows going towards the accumulation addresses have set a new all-time high recently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin is grabbing headlines and speculation from its wide community of investors after a recent whale accumulation from a crypto exchange. On-chain data shows an accumulation trend from this whale, with the latest being the acquisition of 300 million DOGE tokens worth $45 million at the current market price.
 
These speculations have led to theories on who the whale buyer might be amidst a continued price decline for Dogecoin, with the most prominent hypothesis being billionaire Elon Musk.
 
Whale Accumulating Dogecoin
 
Dogecoin is currently on an extended price decline, with its price now down by 25.8% in the past seven days. However, on-chain data shows that a particular whale has been buying the dip, which is a testament to their strong belief in the cryptocurrency.
