        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Keaton Reckard, the community engineer at Hiveon, a mining ecosystem that includes an operating system for Bitcoin mining hardware.
Bitcoin mining refers to the process through which new bitcoin is introduced into circulation. The mining process plays a crucial role in confirming new transactions and maintaining the Bitcoin blockchain ledger as an immutable record of transactions. In essence, miners use ASIC hardware to solve complex computational problems, with the first one to find the solution earning a reward of bitcoin before the cycle restarts. 
Though Bitcoin mining can be time-consuming, expensive and can yield inconsistent rewards depending on price volatility, it still holds a strong allure for investors drawn to the idea of earning bitcoin as comp…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-05-23T13:08:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded on Tuesday, as a result of weakness in the U.S. dollar, following failed talks to tackle the debt ceiling crisis. President Biden stated, “We reiterated once again that default is off the table and the only way to move forward is in good faith toward a bipartisan agreement.”
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $27,000 on Tuesday, as a result of weakness in the greenback, following failed talks to increase the U.S. debt ceiling.
 
After dropping to a low of $26,714.18 to start the week, BTC/USD surged to a peak of $27,434.68 earlier today.
 
Tuesday’s gains saw bitcoin marginally break out of a resistance level at the $27,300 mark.
 
 
This coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) climbing above a ceiling of its own, at 44.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 47.10, with an upcoming zone of 50.00 a likely target for bulls.
 
Should they reach this point, there is a reasonable chance that bitcoin will trade above $27,600.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also surged higher in today’s session, as prices continued to move away from a key level of support.
 
ETH/USD hit an intraday high of $1,869.34 on Monday, 24 hours removed from trading at a bottom of $1,809.54.
 
The move came as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency bounced away from a recent floor at $1,790.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s surge comes following a slight breakout of a ceiling on the RSI at the 50.00 mark.
 
As of writing, price strength is now tracking at 51.97, with the next visible level of resistance at 55.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dash, the open-source, proof-of-work blockchain, is down following a recent hard fork failure. The flaw is preventing the network from generating blocks, effectively preventing users from securely transferring value or making payments. 
 
Dash Blockchain Is Down
 
As of May 23, the Dash blockchain explorer shows that the last block of transactions was confirmed roughly 28 hours ago. The network halt coincides with a failed upgrade on May 22 which would have seen the platform’s code updated to v19.0.0. 
 
 
The bug in the failed hard fork relates to how the consensus algorithm in v19.0.0 was supposed to be implemented. It made the network unstable, forcing block generation offline.
