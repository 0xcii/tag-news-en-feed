According to Batten’s research, despite widespread reports to the contrary, the so-called “ban” was actually a temporary suspension, and mining activities have largely resumed across the country.
 
Bitcoin Mining Was Never Banned In China
 
Batten’s report highlights that the hashrate within China, which is a measure of the computational power used in mining and processing Bitcoin, currently accounts for approximately 15% of the global total. This information stands in stark contrast to the dominant narrative that emerged in May 2021, when numerous major news outlets reported a comprehensive crackdown on cry…]]></summary>

The Formal Objection of FTX Creditors
A group led by Sunil Kavuri, one of FTX's vocal creditors, filed the objection yesterday (Thursday) in the US bankruptcy court. They reject the reorganization plan on several grounds, including the assertion that it does not serve the best interests of the creditors.
The objection further highlighted that the plan ignores property rights issues. Furthermore, it pointed out that, as the settlement with the creditors would be done in cash, it would trigger a taxable event.
