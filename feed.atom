The London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) said on Thursday that it will provide trading and clearing services for derivatives based on the Bitcoin index.
 
In a statement released Thursday, LCH, the clearinghouse arm of the London Stock Exchange Group, said that it would provide clearing services for cash-settled bitcoin (BTC) index futures and options.
 
Cash-settled Bitcoin (BTC) index futures and options contracts traded on GFO-X will have access to LCH’s clearing services, the company announced in a press release.
 
In the UK, GFO-X is the first exchange for digital asset derivatives that is both authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

While SHIB burn numbers are already very high in the first half of April, March 2023 was the strongest month since October 2022.
 
As Bitcoinist reported, SHIB burns are showing a positive trend. In March, 6.78 billion SHIB tokens were burned in 540 transactions. Both the absolute number of SHIB destroyed and the number of transactions thus increased significantly compared to previous months.
 
In February, only 352.21 million SHIB were burned in 128 separate transactions through community burn initiatives. Overall, the March burn is the highest since October 2022. In January 2023, there were 1.12 billion burned in 223 transactions; in Decembe…]]></summary>
