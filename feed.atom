Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett stated, “I’ve been getting some messages about this class action lawsuit against Ripple and Brad Garlinghouse. This appears to be a notice to investors about a lawsuit pending in a Northern California district court that claims the defendants violated federal and California securities laws by offering selling XRP.”
 
Importantly, this is not a new class action lawsuit against Ripple. The case number in the document is No. 18-cv-06753-PJH. When checking this, one can evaluate that this is the Ripple vs. Zakinov case which dates back to May…]]></summary>
