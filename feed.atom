The sell-off was reignited yesterday after a vote on Twitter revealed that Elon Musk is set to step down from his role as Twitter CEO.

Dogecoin (DOGE) momentarily hit its biggest market value of approximately $89 billion on May 8, 2021, with a token price of $0.6818.
 
 
 
 
Dogecoin – More Bite Than Bark?
 
As of this writing, DOGE is trading at $0.074608, down 18% in the last seven days. But the price decline shouldn’t matter much, as the coin now sits on the No. 8 spot in the ranking of the world’s top crypto, with a market cap of $10.24 billion, data from Coingecko show.

When a large institution like FTX implodes, it drags others down with it. It’s a normal occurrence – a domino effect or contagion – many say.
 
It shouldn’t come as a surprise then when some individuals start packing from their workplace as a result of another company’s downfall. There could be other reasons.

This is an opinion editorial by Ruda Pellini co-founder and president of Arthur Mining, an ESG-focused bitcoin mining company.
I recently saw an article that cited the level of leverage and debt of the world's leading Bitcoin mining companies. Since they are listed companies, it is easy to find their financial statements and prove the obvious: this is a counter-cyclical business that requires a lot of efficiency and professional management. 
For those who are still wondering what mining is, let me quickly explain: the term mining makes an analogy to the process of extracting gold and metals, since bitcoin miners are the "producers" of this digital commo…]]></summary>
