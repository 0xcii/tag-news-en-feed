accusations circulating on social media that the crypto exchange froze all

Teng labeled these claims as fear, uncertainty, and

Binance's actions were confined to blocking only those accounts associated with  
illicit activities.
Clarification on Account Freezes
The controversy reportedly arose from a social media post by Ray

In that case, Judge Orrick sided with the SEC, reinforcing the application of the Howey test — the cornerstone of US securities law that determines whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract — to digital assets. Morgan highlighted that Judge Orrick, in his ruling, explicitly supported the approach taken by Judge Analisa Torres in the Ripple case and Judge Amy Berman Jackson in the SEC’s case against Binance.…]]></summary>
