        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. Crypto enthusiasts hold their breath as excitement builds around the upcoming integration of Areon Network‘s new layer 1 chain with major exchanges.
 
Scheduled for January 31 at 14:00 UTC, the integration marks a significant milestone for the project, the resumption of trading for its native token: $AREA.
 
Prior to mainnet launch on January 12, AREA was a token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and was readily available for trading on several exchanges. Now this EVM-compatible chain with a unique consensus mechanism awaits the integration to popular exchanges.

XRP Holders To Face Harsh Reality
 
Recent developments in the XRPL ecosystem, specifically the departure of two significant validator operators, have ignited discussions and debates in the XRP community. Responding to these events, Mobarak took to X (formerly Twitter) to express criticism over Ripple’s management of its ecosystem and the current declined state of the XRP token.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is stepping up its efforts to regulate the burgeoning cryptocurrency market with two key initiatives: establishing criteria for classifying these asset types as financial instruments and setting stricter rules for non-EU companies operating in the bloc.
 
 
These moves come in response to the rapidly growing European crypto market, projected to reach $19 billion by 2028, and increasing calls for regulatory clarity. The landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations passed by the European Parliament last August laid the groundwork, and ESMA is now filling in the crucial details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, Transak, a company specializing in payment infrastructure, revealed its partnership with the financial services powerhouse Visa. This collaboration aims to empower users in 145 nations with the capability to seamlessly exchange their crypto holdings into local fiat currencies, leveraging the Visa Direct platform.
 
Enhanced Crypto Liquidity: Transak’s Alliance with Visa Facilitates Swift Global Transfers
 
Transak, a provider of payment infrastructure for cryptocurrency assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has entered into a partnership with the leading payment company Visa. This collaboration facilitates instant withdrawals of crypto funds to debit cards in 145 countries, as highlighted by Transak’s announcement.
 
“By enabling real-time card withdrawals through Visa Direct, Transak is delivering a faster, simpler and more connected experience for its users — making it easier to convert crypto balances into fiat, which can be spent at the more than 130M merchant locations where Visa is accepted,” the North America head of Visa Direct and Global Ecosystem Readiness, Yanilsa Gonzalez-Ore said.
 
The press announcement sent to Bitcoin.com News highlights that a key attribute of Visa Direct is its capability for immediate transaction processing. This translates to the possibility of money transfers being completed in nearly 30 minutes or less, marking a notable improvement compared to conventional banking practices, which often require several days.
 
 
“Combining this with Transak’s robust infrastructure and support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, the collaboration welcomes a new dawn for those who want to quickly exit the crypto market,” the company emphasized. The partnership follows Visa’s announcement earlier this month that it will include Web3 elements in its customized loyalty program solution.

Dogecoin Daily New Addresses Have Set A New All-Time High
 
As pointed out by an analyst, Ali, in a post on X, the DOGE network has seen some impressive growth in addresses recently. The relevant on-chain indicator here is “Daily New Addresses,” which keeps track of the total amount of addresses coming online for the first time on the Dogecoin blockchain every day.
 
There are a couple of reasons why new addresses would be created on the blockchain. The first and the more major factor is natural adoption, as fresh investors coming into the asset would create new addresses for themselves.

The Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals
 
On or around January 26, the discount to the net asset value (NAV) of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) narrowed to zero for the first time in nearly three years. Since descending to 44% in June 2023, the discount has gradually shrunk and by Dec. 20, 2023, it had reached the single-digit figure of 7%.

This is not on any level what Anarchy means. It is simply a system lacking rulers or a central authority, where all cooperation and coordination is done on a purely voluntary basis between peers in the system. The etymology of the original Greek word, anarhkia, itself literally just means “without rulers.” An, meaning without, arkhia, meaning rulers. 
This concept is the foundational reality of why Bitcoin functions as a distributed network and protocol. There is literally no one in charge of the network. If there were, then it would not be a distributed system composed of sovereign individuals voluntarily choosing to interact with each other.
