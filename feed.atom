        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although  
the cryptocurrency market has significantly developed over the past few years,  
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) still uses the same tactics it  
employed almost five years ago. The institution has once again postponed its  
decision on approving spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Even the  
recent court ruling challenging its position has not changed the institution's  
stance.
SEC (Once Again) Postpones Decision on Spot  
Bitcoin ETFs
Initially  
scheduled for next week, the new decision dates for applications from Invesco,  
WisdomTree, and Valkyrie have been extended to mid-October. This development  
comes close to a federal appeals court ruling, which ordered the SEC to  
reconsider an application from Grayscale Investments for a similar product.

This was the first SEC decision deadline in the listing process for these applicants since filing, with the delays pushing these applications back another 45 days. The next bulk of deadlines are being slated for the middle of October.

Earlier this week, Grayscale won its lawsuit with the SEC, resulting in the DC Circuit court of appeals vacating the SEC's denial of Grayscale's $GBTC conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF. This means it will be sent back to the SEC, in which now the commission has 45 days to appeal and file for an en banc hearing, if they wish to do so. 
While this victory in court does not mean GBTC is automatically being converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, this ruling does help bring us one step closer to one being approved by the SEC. Because the U.S. court of appeals shot down the SEC's reasonings for denying Grayscale's application, stating, "The Commission neither disputed Grayscale's evidence that the spot and future markets for bitcoin are 99.9% correlated, nor suggested that market inefficiencies or other factors would undermine the correlation...The Commission’s unexplained discounting of the obvious financial and mathematical relationship between the spot and futures markets falls short of the standard for reasoned decision making."
Yesterday, Bloomberg analysts Seyffart and Balchunas upped their approval odds by the SEC for a spot Bitcoin ETF to 75% by the end of this year, and to 95% by the end of 2024.

Nexo Unveils Dual Mode Card Capabilities to Streamline Crypto Payments
 
Nexo‘s new feature enables real-time toggling between modes within the Nexo app, providing flexibility based on users’ budgets and purchase needs, according to the company’s announcement on Thursday. Nexo said the newly launched service enhances the capabilities of its cryptocurrency card.
 
“The Nexo Card embodies the pinnacle of customer-centric innovation, cultivated from user-driven needs that Nexo has been diligently addressing over the years,” Nexo co-founder and managing partner Antoni Trenchev told Bitcoin.com News. “By bringing the pioneering Nexo Card with the Dual Mode capability to market, Nexo has further strengthened its position as a leading innovator in the crypto space,” Trenchev added.
 
First introduced in 2022, the Nexo card was developed with Mastercard and Dipocket. With Dual Mode, the Mastercard offers different functions based on the user’s needs, according to Nexo. The company’s announcement further details that users can earn interest on their balance and make free ATM withdrawals up to €10,000 per month.
 
Crypto debit cards first emerged around 2016, with early providers like Wirex and Bitpay issuing Visa and Mastercard-brand products. Their popularity has grown as cryptocurrencies have become more mainstream. Over the years, these cards have provided a convenient way to utilize crypto for daily purchases without having to cash out.
