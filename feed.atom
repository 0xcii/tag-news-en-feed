In an interview, Pav Hundal, lead analyst for Australian exchange Swyftx, told CoinTelegraph that hoping for a $1 price target for Dogecoin could be risky.
 
Why Dogecoin Might Not Reach $1
 
In the interview, Hundal suggests that the Dogecoin price reaching $1 could be a perilous journey due to its holder base. The crypto analyst attributed this to the fact that there are a lot of DOGE holders who had purchased the meme coin in 2021 due to the hype at the time. But at current prices, these holders are currently nursing losses.
 
 
The logic is that these holders will be waiting for any opportunity to break even, and once the price …]]></summary>
