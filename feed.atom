The analyst, posting on X, noted that BTC prices are now trading above the 15-month channel resistance. Earlier today, Bitcoin broke above the upper trend line of the ascending channel. 
 
Accordingly, Brandt now thinks this breakout, especially considering what has been happening with the rate of Bitcoin absorption among institutions, would propel the coin higher. 
 
 
With this background, the analyst revised Bitcoin’s target from $120,000 to $250,000. Brandt added that this uptrend will end by August/September 2025.
