Despite the current uptrend in the crypto market, the algorithm is less than optimistic about the price of DOGE over the next month and the price prediction reflects this.
 
Dogecoin Price At $0.065
 
The CoinCodex machine learning algorithm has put the Dogecoin price at the $0.0657 mark in the next month. This price level is significantly lower than its current $0.076 price and is contrary to the belief of crypto analysts that the DOGE price is ready to keep pumping.
 
 
Such a decline in the price of Dogecoin would mean an approximately 17% drop in price but still leave it above its current 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $0.064. This could mean that the drop …]]></summary>

The “mining difficulty” refers to a feature on the Bitcoin blockchain that controls how hard the miners would find it to mine on the network. For example, miners have to work more to solve the next block when its value goes up.
 
Now, why does this feature exist at all? The reason is that Satoshi wanted BTC’s block rewards (the rewards that miners receive as compensation for solving blocks) to be given out at a constant rate, no matter the network conditions.
