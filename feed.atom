The world you live in was never disenchanted. The curse of disenchantment, otherwise known as the Age of Reason, achieved only a confusion of the sacred and profane. One particular manifestation is that all popular entertainments and media have their roots in shamanism, ritual, and divination. The fact that theater originated in sorcery, though broadly unfamiliar to the public, is well known in academia. In Phyllis Hartnoll’s A Concise History of the Theater (1971): “The origins of the theater go back far into the past, to the religious rites of the earliest communities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Onchain data and reports have highlighted unusual outflows from cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, prompting concerns of a possible hot wallet breach worth approximately $114 million. Justin Sun, the exchange’s proprietor and Tron’s creator, has stated that the incident is under investigation.
 
Poloniex’s Hot Wallets Breached in $114M Hack
 
The breach at the centralized digital currency platform Poloniex, which occurred on Friday, November 10, 2023, involved a suspected loss of $114 million, as noted by onchain analysts. Cyvers, a team that provides real-time blockchain security alerts, issued a warning: “Red Code: Hey Poloniex [and] Poloniex Support, you better contact us as soon as possible,” they alerted.
 
In response to the event, Poloniex announced on the social media platform X that it had temporarily disabled its wallet system. “Our wallet has been disabled for maintenance,” Poloniex stated. “We will update this thread once the wallet has been re-enabled.”
 
 
While the estimated losses currently stand at $114 million, the impact on a considerable number of hot wallets suggests that the total could be higher. Justin Sun informed the crypto community through the social media platform X about the breach, assuring them of Poloniex’s commitment to rectify the situation.
 
“We are currently investigating the Poloniex hack incident,” Sun wrote. “Poloniex maintains a healthy financial position and will fully reimburse the affected funds. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities for collaboration with other exchanges to facilitate the recovery of these funds.” Sun further added that a bounty was created, stating:
 

We are offering a 5% white hat bounty to the Poloniex hacker. Please return the funds to the following ETH/TRX/BTC wallets. We will give you 7 days to consider this offer before we engage law enforcement.

So far, over $60 million in crypto is suspected to be already stolen spanning digital assets such as Tron (TRX), Pepe (PEPE), and Magic (MAGIC), among others.
 
Poloniex Crypto Exchange Under Attack
 
The attack was first brought to light by Peckshield which noticed unusual transactions from wallets linked to Poloniex. The blockchain security firm then took to X (formerly Twitter) to point out the transactions to the crypto exchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swiss bank UBS Group AG has now entered the cryptocurrency arena alongside global banking giant HSBC Holdings Plc, enabling wealthy clients in Hong Kong to engage in the trading of specific cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded funds. This strategic decision not only reflects a growing trend among major banks but also underscores Hong Kong’s aspirations to establish itself as a focal point for the flourishing world of digital assets.
 
Significantly, UBS’s Hong Kong platform has now opened doors to three cryptocurrency-linked ETFs, including the Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active and CSOP Bitcoin Futures. This comes after receiving the green light from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), marking a pivotal step in the integration of crypto assets into traditional financial markets.

At first glance, this looks like a positive development if you happen to think crypto adoption is a positive thing. However, on looking at the details of the FCA’s position, it becomes less apparent whether PayPal is being granted meaningful permissions, or whether the permissions on offer serve only to define certain inherent restrictions.
 On top of that, the Bank of England this week released proposals relating to the integration of stablecoin payments through a plan for regulation, which again, looks like a step towards crypto adoption, but with the caveat that terms and conditions apply.

Bitcoin users with multiple UTXOs can face hefty fees for future transactions, which depletes the value of their holdings over time. Understanding UTXO consolidation is essential for anyone looking to optimize their bitcoin management strategies.
 
Understanding UTXOs and Their Role in Your Wallet
 
When you receive bitcoin (BTC), the transaction generates UTXOs, which is essentially the “change” that you can spend in future transactions. Each UTXO is an entry in Bitcoin’s ledger, indicating that a certain amount of BTC has not been spent and is available to be sent in a new transaction.
