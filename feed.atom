        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-nears-5-month-high-to-start-the-week-despite-crypto-market-consolidation/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-27T15:32:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp moved back towards a five-month high on Monday, as prices surged for a third straight session. The token formerly known as ripple was one of the very few gainers to start the week, as markets mostly consolidated. Polygon edged closer to a multi-week low to start the week.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, rose for a third consecutive session on Monday, as prices neared a five-month high.
 
Following a low of 0.4438 on Sunday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4877 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, XRP moved closer to a recent high of $0.4940, which is the strongest point the token has hit since November 6.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this latest rally comes as the relative strength index (RSI) moved towards a ceiling at 70.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 66.91, and should it pass the 70.00 mark, then XRP will likely hit a fresh multi-month high.
 
A long-term ceiling at the $0.5000 mark could potentially be a target for current bulls in the market.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC), moved lower to start the week, with the token falling towards a recent support point.
 
MATIC/USD fell to a bottom at $1.08, which comes a day after prices were trading at a high of $1.12.
 
Overall, polygon is now on the brink of colliding with the $1.05 floor, which was last hit on March 12.
 
 
From the chart, it looks like a downward cross has taken place between the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
In addition to this, the RSI is now tracking at 43.62, which is marginally above a resistance level of 43.00.
 
Should momentum continue to fall, there is a strong possibility that MATIC will move below $1.00.

Bitcoin Miners Have Spent Almost Equal Number Of Days In Profit As They Have In Loss
 
According to a new report published by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, BTC miners have been enjoying profits recently. To know whether Bitcoin miners are making profits or losses, the difference between their revenue and expenses is taken.
 
The firm defines the “mining revenue” as the sum of the total value of coins that miners are issuing (that is, the BTC they are getting through mining block rewards) and the transaction fees that they are receiving for handling transfers.
 
As for expenses incurred by these chain validators, Glassnode has assumed t…]]></summary>

Do Kwon might also face judgment in the US over the collapse of LUNA and UST algorithmic stablecoin collapse that caused a $40 billion loss in crypto. But, the time of his extradition from Montenegro remains uncertain.

Paez received master’s degrees in physics and ethnomusicology and is currently finishing a PhD in civil engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leaders from the Group of Seven nations, or G7, are reportedly gearing up to take on cryptocurrencies with a call for stricter regulations at their next meeting, according to a report from Kyoto news agency. 
 
The move comes as governments around the world grapple with the challenges posed by digital currencies, which have been linked to money laundering, cybercrime, and other illicit activities.
 
Officials have indicated that the G7 is planning to ramp up discussions on the matter and hold a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in mid-May, just a few days before this year’s summit in Hiroshima, which will be hosted by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

        <updated>2023-03-27T12:23:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week trading around the $28,000 mark, as markets reacted to the news that Silicon Valley Bank was to be acquired. First Citizen Bank agreed to buy approximately $72 billion in SVB assets, at a discounted rate of $16.5 billion. Ethereum continued to trade under $1,800 on Monday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the week trading marginally higher, with prices hovering near the $28,000 level.
 
Following a bottom at $27,678.15 on Sunday, BTC/USD moved to a high of $28,178.14 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw bitcoin edge towards a recent resistance point at the $28,300 mark, which was last hit on Friday.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, BTC has mostly consolidated on Monday, which comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a ceiling at the 65.00 zone.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at the 64.51 level, with the next visible point of support at the 62.00 mark.
 
Should bulls take price strength below this point, there is a strong possibility that BTC could move below $27,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) largely consolidated on Monday, as prices moved away from a key price floor in today’s session.
 
ETH/USD jumped to a peak of $1,797.88 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a low of $1,748.44.
 
Since hitting a seven-month high of $1,861 last Thursday, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency has mostly traded below $1,800.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, ethereum is down 1.19% from the same point last week, with prices mostly moving between a floor of $1,730, and a ceiling at $1,820.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average has now begun to shift direction, with upwards momentum now fading.
 
Prices may continue to trend sideways heading into April, unless some unexpected news moves markets.

Ridyard added that while defi is seen as “a fantastic proof of concept,” widespread adoption of this alternative to traditional finance is only possible when the developer and user experience is improved. 
 
Developer Incentives and Mass Adoption of Defi
 
Besides improving developer and user experience, the Radix CEO told Bitcoin.com News that the provision of ongoing and sustainable support to developers ensures “you [don’t] end up with a ghost chain.” Ridyard, a YC Alumni, also shared thoughts on how defi and Web3’s scaling woes can be overcome.
