Dogecoin And Shiba Inu See Large Losses
 
Over the last week, most cryptocurrencies in the market are down significantly from their January peaks. Among these are Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, both of which have seen their losses climb into the double-digit territory in a seven-day period.

        <updated>2023-03-09T16:34:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon fell to its lowest point since January earlier in today’s session, as overall sentiment in crypto markets remained bearish. Overall, the global market cap is now down 1.46% as of writing. Solana also slipped on Thursday, as the token neared a two-month low.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Thursday saw polygon (MATIC) drop to its weakest point since January, as sentiment in the market remained bearish.
 
Following a high of $1.11 on Wednesday, MATIC/USD moved to a bottom at $1.04 earlier in today’s session.
 
The last time polygon traded at this level was back on January 26, which is the last time price was under $1.00.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this comes as the relative strength index (RSI) of 14 days fell to a long-term floor at 35.00
 
As of writing, the index has since rebounded and is at the 36.59 mark, with the next visible point of reference being 42.00.
 
Overall, bulls have moved in to buy the earlier dip, and as of writing MATIC is trading at $1.07.
 

 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was another victim of Thursday’s red wave, as the token also fell to a multi-month low.
 
SOL/USD found a bottom at $18.20 earlier today, which comes a day after it resided at a high of $19.33.
 
Similar to polygon, this sell-off pushed the token to its weakest point since January, with prices now down by over 15% in the past week.
 
 
Honing in on the chart, the RSI is now tracking at 33.96, which is its weakest reading since the start of the year.
 
However, after seven days in the red, SOL has marginally rebounded, after appearing to find a floor at the $18.50 mark.
 
Should this floor hold firm in the coming days, then there is a good chance that bulls could attempt to recapture the $20.00 mark.

Mt. Gox was once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, but in 2014, it suffered a massive hack that resulted in the loss of 850,000 BTC. The hack devastated the cryptocurrency community, and Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy shortly after. 
 
Since then, a long and complicated legal process has been underway to determine how the remaining assets of Mt. Gox should be distributed among creditors.
