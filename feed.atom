        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FTX's Founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, is set to stand trial  
tomorrow (Tuesday). He faces charges related to the crypto exchange's collapse and the alleged misappropriation of billions of dollars in customers' funds. This six-week trial aims to reveal testimonies, internal documents, and emails that will shed light on the FTX scandal.
The most intriguing revelations are likely to come from the  
prosecution's witnesses, who were once firmly in Bankman-Fried's inner circle.  
Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund  
connected to FTX, is one of the most highly-anticipated witnesses. Her unique  
perspective is linked to her involvement with both FTX and Alameda Research,  
as well as her personal relationship with Bankman-Fried.

Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana, took to the social network X (formerly known as Twitter) to voice his complaints and criticisms about Ethereum.

In a post made on Sunday, Yakovenko expressed his discontent, stating that Ethereum is not a harbinger of genuine revolution but rather a “spectacle of bourgeois upheaval.”
 
According to Yakovenko, while Ethereum may captivate the “petite bourgeoisie” with its “digital carnival,” it subtly perpetuates forms of “oppression.”

This move comes after the SEC recently delayed applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs from major financial players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck due to last week’s looming US government shutdown.
 
Renowned ETF analysts, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, had previously estimated a 75% probability of approval for these ETFs earlier this year. However, this outlook appears to be in question given the recent delays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grayscale Investments, the largest digital asset fund manager by assets under management (AUM), has filed to convert its Ethereum Trust into a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). The news follows ether futures ETFs from Vaneck, Bitwise, and Proshares launching on Monday.
 
Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust on Path to Become Spot Ether ETF
 
On October 2, 2023, Grayscale announced it has submitted a Form 19b-4 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Ethereum Trust into a physically backed ETF on NYSE Arca.
 
“As we file to convert ETHE to an ETF, the natural next step in the product’s evolution, we recognize this as an important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter,” Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said.
 
The company’s press release said the Form 19b-4 filing coincides with the futures ETFs from Vaneck, Proshares, and Bitwise that began trading Monday. Grayscale is also working to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a physically backed ETF but faces a legal challenge with the SEC over its approval. Launched in March 2019, the Ethereum Trust now has an AUM of $4.96 billion, Grayscale’s web portal shows.
 
 
Grayscale also plans to launch an ethereum futures ETF based on cash-settled CME futures contracts with regulatory approval. David LaValle, Grayscale’s global head of ETFs, said Monday that the filing “is another important milestone as Grayscale continues to build its best-in-class ETF team, product suite, and capabilities – serving investors as a globally respected asset manager with unmatched crypto expertise.”

In line with this, legal experts have weighed in on how the case could play out once the trial commences.
 
From The Prosecution’s Angle
 
In an interview with Decrypt, these legal experts mentioned that the Prosecution’s proactiveness shows they are confident of securing a conviction. Usually, the prosecution takes time to gather as much evidence as possible before moving to trial to ensure that it secures a conviction. 
 
 
However, in this case, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has moved swiftly to kickstart the trial, which suggests that they have all the arsenal to put Sam Bankman-Fried in jail for a long time.
