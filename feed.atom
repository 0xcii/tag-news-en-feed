by Binance that it violated the terms of the agreement in a sports sponsorship

According to a report by  
the media publication SportBusiness, the AFA claims that Binance terminated the

Launching the first unequivocally positive news cycle for the Bitcoin space since the collapse of FTX, BlackRock recently decided to file for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Within a few days, two additional behemoth money managers joined BlackRock as Invesco reactivated its application for a spot BTC ETF and ETF-specialist WisdomTree submitted its third application for a BTC ETF to the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC).
As of this writing, nobody can say if the proposed vehicles will be approved by the SEC, which has recently made headlines for its heavy-handed pursuit of crypto’s most prominent exchanges in Coinbase and Binance. We will know soon enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin slipped below the $30,000 mark on Wednesday, as markets continued to react to the latest U.S. retail sales report. Sales rose by 0.2% last month, which is more than the 0.5% sum many had forecasted. Ethereum has remained resilient, climbing back above $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below $30,000 on Wednesday, following the latest retail sales data from the United States.
 
After climbing to a peak of $30,184.18 on Tuesday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $29,556.43 earlier today.
 
The decline came in the midst of a five-day win-less run, which occurred soon after last week’s move close to $32,000.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Bulls have since started to fight back, with bitcoin now back above $30,000, helped by the relative strength index (RSI).
 
The index found a support point at the 50.00 mark, and has so far resisted a breakout of this level.
 
One area of concern for bulls is a recent downward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages, which could result in a future sell-off.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was marginally lower on hump-day, as price briefly broke out of the $1,900 level.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,878.72 earlier in the day, but has gone on to record a high of $1,918.12.
 
Similar to bitcoin, ethereum has been trending lower for five straight days, prior to Wednesday’s rebound.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that the RSI is heading towards a ceiling of 55.00, following today’s bounce back, which could be enough to take ETH to a key price point of its own.
 
The target appears to be the $1,930 mark, which was last hit during the weekend’s trading session.
 
In the event this ceiling is broken, there is a good chance that ethereum could make another run towards $2,000.

On Tuesday, July 11, liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi launched its NFT collection called Ether.Fan. According to the team, the NFTs in this collection are based on “staked ETH and focused on Ethereum decentralization.”
 
Mike Silagadze, CEO of Ether.Fi, dubbed the 3,000-NFT collection launch as “wildly successful,” claiming that all the non-fungible tokens were minted within a day, with more than 6,200 ETH staked in the process.
