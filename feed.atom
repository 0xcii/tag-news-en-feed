        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) mining has faced increasing scrutiny from the US government and environmental critics in recent years. Certain groups raised concerns that the energy consumption required for validating transactions on the network contributes to global carbon emissions.
 
 A recent article by The New York Times (NYT) reignited this debate, alleging “that Bitcoin mining is a major contributor to environmental damage,” as reported by Bitcoinist. 
 
However, Riot Platforms, a leading Bitcoin mining company, claims the New York Times article was full of “distortions” and “falsehoods” designed to push a political agenda. In response to the New York Times allegations, Riot defended the industry and emphasized its commitment to sustainable Bitcoin mining practices.

Developers are exploring the use of hierarchical channels to help speed up and make the Lightning Network (LN) more scalable. Hierarchical channels allow for flexible off-chain resizing of channels, enabling quick and cheap resizing, without on-chain transactions which add delays and costs. In contrast, resizing channels on-chain can cause delays of several months and increases fees. The current proposals for resizing channels off-chain involve creating a channel factory or CoinPool and exchanging capacity between channels within the same factory or pool.
