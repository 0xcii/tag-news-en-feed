        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/crypto-exchange-zondacrypto-wins-7th-license-with-cysec-approval/"/>
        <updated>2024-10-21T18:13:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) licensed  
crypto exchange Zondacrypto, marking the 7th regulatory license for the  
company. With over 1.3 million active users, the company welcomed the  
regulatory step as a part of its efforts to offer a secure digital asset  
trading platform. 
Preparing for MiCA Regulations
Speaking about the approval, CEO Przemyslaw Kral, said on  
LinkedIn: "Happy to announce that Zondacrypto has secured its 7th license,  
this time from the CySEC. This  
milestone further solidifies our mission to provide a safe, transparent, and  
fully compliant trading environment for our 1.3 million active users."
"As we prepare for the upcoming MiCA regulations in the  
EU, this new license reinforces our dedication to maintaining the highest  
standards of security and compliance in the crypto space. And this commitment  
is something we take very seriously."
The company cited the EU's forthcoming Markets in  
Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which aim to provide a more unified legal  
framework for digital assets.
CySEC License
As the crypto sector continues to evolve, Zondacrypto is  
setting the bar higher for compliance, signaling to users and regulators alike  
that security and transparency remain at the heart of its mission.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Backed by legions of devoted fans and bold ambitions, the Shiba Inu price trajectory has become a topic of hot debate.
 
However, as SHIB tries to expand its ecosystem with initiatives such as Shibarium and token burns, its growth is still ongoing. Although Shiba Inu is on the right track, some believe that it will be overtaken by a less popular altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF), which has the potential to grow 3,000 times.

October has historically been a strong month for cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. However, we have yet to witness the impressive gains we’ve seen in previous years. Currently, Bitcoin is up over 6% for the month, which is somewhat encouraging. Given how “Uptober” began, it seemed likely that the month would end either flat or with minimal returns. So, what caused this, and why haven’t we seen the significant gains expected? If we look back to the start of October, several announcements and developments during that time contributed to Bitcoin’s initial slump earlier in the month.
