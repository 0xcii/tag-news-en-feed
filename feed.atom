Gox recently executed a huge transaction carrying over 48,641 Bitcoin, igniting speculations about an upcoming repayment to creditors after the firm went bankrupt years ago. Thus, cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors are closely watching the reaction of Bitcoin as Mt. Gox continues to carry out massive BTC transactions.

However, with the German government done with all its selling, the Bitcoin price, as well as the crypto market, has rebounded in response, rising over 20% since then.

Schiff didn’t miss the chance to poke fun at Bitcoin by saying that it had dropped 30% since its record high in 2021. “Gold continues to show its worth as a stable and valuable product, while Bitcoin shines as a speculative bubble,” he said. His views come at a time when the price of Bitcoin is going through big changes, which adds to the fight between traditional assets and digital ones.
