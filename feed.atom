        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto.com sued the US Securities and Exchange  
Commission (SEC). The crypto exchange claims the SEC has expanded its  
jurisdiction beyond statutory limits regarding its interpretation of crypto  
assets as securities. 
This lawsuit followed a Wells notice by the regulator  
against the company. In its statement, the exchange argued that the SEC had  
imposed an unlawful rule categorizing most crypto transactions as securities,  
while transactions involving Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) escape this  
classification. 
Clarity in Crypto Regulations
In addition to the lawsuit, Crypto.com Derivatives  
North America (CDNA) petitioned the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)  
and the SEC for clarification on the regulation of certain cryptocurrency  
derivative products. Crypto.com maintains that the distinction by the regulator lacks a  
foundation in law and ignores the similarities between these assets.
“Specifically, our lawsuit contends that the SEC has  
unilaterally expanded its jurisdiction beyond statutory limits and separately  
that the SEC has established an unlawful rule that trades in nearly all crypto  
assets are securities transactions no matter how they are sold, whereas  
identical transactions in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are somehow not,”  
Crypto.com mentioned. 
The petition seeks to confirm that these products fall  
exclusively under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. The company highlighted the Dodd-Frank  
Act, a regulation that facilitates joint interpretations between regulatory  
bodies.
SEC to Respond
Under the joint rules, the CFTC and SEC have 120 days  
to respond to the petition, either by issuing an interpretation or providing  
written justification for denial. This process is designed to enhance  
regulatory clarity for market participants.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.
