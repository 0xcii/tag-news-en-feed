        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/bitcoin-soars-to-all-time-high-at-69200-driven-by-etfs/"/>
        <updated>2024-03-05T16:18:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin marked a historic milestone after its price  
surpassed $69,200 today (Tuesday), according to Coinbase's data. This surge followed  
a broader trend of heightened interest and investment in Bitcoin, driven  
notably by the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the  
United States.
Bitcoin's ascent to new heights is mostly due to the  
influx of investment from the latest wave of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds  
(ETFs) in the United States, Cointelegraph reported. These ETFs have emerged as  
a pivotal driver of the cryptocurrency's price appreciation.
The Impact of the ETFs
Despite its unprecedented surge to new all-time  
highs, Bitcoin remains susceptible to significant volatility, particularly in  
light of the upcoming halving event. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of Bitcoin has  
jumped 18% in the past week and 1% in the past 24 hours to trade at $67,242 at  
the time of this publication.
The impending halving, a key feature of Bitcoin's  
protocol that reduces block rewards by half approximately every four years,  
poses a challenge and uncertainties for investors navigating the cryptocurrency  
landscape.
As Bitcoin's price surges past its all-time high, institutional investors are seizing the opportunity to dive into the cryptocurrency market through ETFs, Finance Magnates reported. Last week, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF experienced a record-breaking inflow of $520 million, underlining the escalating frenzy surrounding Bitcoin.

TradFi Is In “For A Shock”: Analyst
 
Citing events in the Bitcoin Macro Index, the analyst contends that even with BTC breaking records as it climbs higher, it is not backed by “full fundamentals.” This outlook is because BTC prices remain below a crucial level on the index. If this level is broken, Woo warns, the traditional market will be in “for a shock.”

Bitcoin’s Price Surge
 
The success of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have been trading for just over seven weeks, has opened doors for both institutional and retail investors. The SEC’s approval of these investment vehicles has provided a regulated and accessible entry point into the cryptocurrency market. This development has fueled heightened interest and confidence, leading to increased demand for BTC and propelling its price to new heights.

        <updated>2024-03-05T15:06:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nexo's entity based in Dubai has secured the initial  
approval from Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) to offer  
lending, borrowing, investment, and broker-dealer services for virtual assets.  
This marks the digital asset platform's entry into Dubai's digital asset space.
Kalin Metodiev, the Co-Founder and Managing Partner  
at Nexo, mentioned: "Nexo is enthusiastic about the pursuit of new market  
strategies aligned with the transformative guidance of Dubai's Virtual Asset  
Regulatory Authority."
Nexo's Global Expansion
Dubai established the VARA in 2022, highlighting the  
region's commitment to becoming a global hub for digital asset innovation. For  
Nexo, with its user base of 7 million, Dubai represents a significant  
opportunity in its global expansion plans.
VARA regulates virtual assets across the Emirate of Dubai, including Special Development Zones and Free Zones, but excluding the Dubai International Financial Centre. This entity plays an important role in creating legal frameworks for protecting investors and establishing international standards for the virtual asset industry.
Recently, Nexo launched a legal offensive against the Republic of Bulgaria, filing a substantial arbitration claim exceeding $3  
billion. The claim stems from what Nexo termed as unjust and politically  
motivated interferences by Bulgarian authorities, disrupting crucial deals and  
causing significant financial harm.
Defying Regulatory Hurdles
Nexo's pursuit of justice follows the dismissal of  
baseless criminal charges against its leadership, including Kosta Kantchev,  
Antoni Trenchev, Kalin Metodiev, and Trayan Nikolov. The company's collaborations with investment banks  
for a funding round and an IPO valued at $8-$12 billion were disrupted. Moreover,  
a strategic partnership with a major European football club was abruptly  
halted.
