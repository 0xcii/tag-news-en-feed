        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of refinement, Ethereum, the world’s largest smart contracts platform, is scaling. However, it does not scale in the way most decentralization purists desire. The network, trying to accommodate all its users, now relies mainly on off-chain solutions using roll-up techniques to process more transactions and relieve the mainnet.
 
The Ethereum Layer-2 Boom
 
The result has seen a boom with layer-2 platforms. According to L2Beat, all these off-chain solutions scaling Ethereum manage over $37 billion worth of assets. The largest of them all is Arbitrum, which controls more than $13 billion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates in September, Bitcoin has been volatile yet predominantly bullish. Analysts and investors are now waiting patiently for the next leg up, as BTC recently stopped at the $69,400 mark and is finding strong support around $66,000. This level is key, as it could determine Bitcoin’s next price movement.
 
 
Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that the Bitcoin Average Profitability Index is currently at 202%, indicating that the price is roughly twice the realized price. This metric provides confidence to investors and traders who expect Bitcoin to continue rising.
