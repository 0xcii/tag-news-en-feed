        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest stages in sports is approaching it’s final match, as France and Argentina are set to face off in a storyline matchup on Sunday. Argentinian Lionel Messi sets to bring home his first World Cup championship despite a storied career, but will need to overcome a powerful France squad that has given up just a single goal throughout the tournament.
 
Meanwhile, crypto partnerships in sport seem to have a damper on them that hasn’t been seen since pre-2021 bull run, before big dollar spending in sport sponsorship was nearly as prominent as it is today.
 
As the market has cooled, so too have the sports deals. Let’s take a look at the activity across sports and crypto over the past week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Dec. 14, the Ethereum software firm Consensys announced that the company has teamed up with the payment processing giant Paypal. The integration allows Metamask wallet users to purchase ethereum via Paypal from within the Web3 wallet application.
 
Consensys Teams up With Payments Giant Paypal
 
According to Consensys, Metamask users can now purchase ethereum (ETH) using the payment provider Paypal. The financial technology company Paypal started offering cryptocurrency services in 2021 and the company’s CEO detailed that demand for crypto outstripped initial expectations.
 
The Ethereum software firm Consensys explained Wednesday it has teamed up with Paypal, and the team further detailed that “Metamask will be the first Web3 wallet to leverage PayPal to drive more successful on-ramp transactions.” Essentially, the partnership will allow users to utilize their Paypal account to purchase ethereum (ETH) after the Metamask owner logs into the Paypal platform via the wallet.
 
Consensys’ blog post adds that the Paypal integration with Metamask is just one of the “series of announcements” that will be associated with the Metamask mobile wallet. “This integration with Paypal will allow our U.S. users to not just buy crypto seamlessly through Metamask, but also to easily explore the Web3 ecosystem,” the product manager for Metamask, Lorenzo Santos said.
 
 
The partnership announcement follows the controversial Consensys privacy policy news that details the company collects specific data from Metamask users. Paypal has also been dealing with controversy in recent times after the company erroneously published a terms of service (ToS) document that said people who spread disinformation would be fined $2,500. However, Paypal claimed the ToS “notice recently went out in error that included incorrect information.”
 
What do you think about Metamask implementing Paypal into the wallet so Web3 users can purchase ethereum within the app via Paypal? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.]]></summary>

On Dec. 17, 2022, the TVL in defi is roughly $39.53 billion after dropping more than 4% in value during the past 24 hours.
 
Value Locked in Defi Drops Below $40 Billion
 
The value locked in defi protocols has dropped below the $40 billion region for the first time in 675 days, or since the first week of Feb. 2021. At that period in time, it was the first time the TVL in defi reached the $40 billion mark after climbing from the $1 billion zone a year prior in Feb. 2020.
 

 
With the aggregate locked in defi today at $39.53 billion, statistics show that Makerdao commands the largest TVL this weekend and dominates by 14.91%. Makerdao’s TVL is around $5.89 billion and during the last week, it has shed 6.88% in value. In terms of value-locked data, Makerdao’s TVL is followed by Lido, Curve, Aave, and Uniswap respectively.
 
Most of the value locked today is held on Ethereum as there’s $23.06 billion in value locked in ETH-based defi apps, which represents 58.33% of the aggregate locked. Ethereum’s TVL is followed by Tron, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Fantome, Cronos, and Solana.
 
 
The entire lot of smart contract protocol tokens today has lost 7.5% in value against the U.S. dollar, equating to a total of $240 billion. Out of the top ten smart contract protocol tokens, BNB saw the largest weekly decline as it has lost 17.6% during the past seven days. Ethereum Classic (ETC) suffered a loss of 16.3% during the past week and Tron suffered the least with a 2.2% loss over the last seven days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano fell to a fresh all-time low on Saturday, as prices plunged by over 10% to start the weekend. The move saw the token drop for a third straight session, as a red wave swept through cryptocurrency markets. Binance coin also moved lower, dropping for a seventh consecutive day.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) moved to a fresh all-time low to start the weekend, as prices dropped for a third straight session.
 
Following a high of $0.3011 on Friday, ADA/USD moved to a low of $0.2603 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw the token plunge by nearly 13% earlier in the day, hitting a new all-time low in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the drop comes as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
This signals a shift in price momentum, and comes as the relative strength index (RSI) fell deeper into oversold territory.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 24.13, which is its weakest point since October 21.
 
 
Binance Coin (BNB)
 
Binance coin (BNB) was another notable token to fall today, with prices dropping for a seventh straight session.
 
Recent declines have come as financial firm Mazars halted its audit of Binance’s reserves.
 
As a result of this, BNB/USD fell to a low of $221.00, which comes a day after hitting a high of $264.25.
 
 
Overall, the token is now down by nearly 20% in the last week, and is down 10.88% as of writing.
 
Similar to cardano, the RSI on BNB is currently trading near the 24.00 mark, which is deep in oversold territory.
 
BNB is currently trading at its lowest point since July 13.

In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple and its current and former chief executives. The regulator alleged that they carried out $1.3 billion in sales of unregistered securities since the launch of Ripple’s native token, XRP.
 
 
Since then, the lawsuit has been deliberated upon in different dimensions, with several issues popping out once in a while.
 
Currently, the case is moving toward the Summary Judgement announcement even as the amicus curiae files a new request.
 
An amicus curiae, sometimes known as a “friend of the court,” is an individual or organization that is not a party to a legal dispute but is permitted to assist the court by providing relevant information, expertise, or insight.

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) extended recent declines on Saturday, as markets continued to be nervous following recent uncertainty surrounding Binance’s proof-of-reserves audit.
