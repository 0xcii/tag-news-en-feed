Bitcoin Witnesses “Rare” Buy Signal
 
Mikybull Crypto revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin had just witnessed a rare hash ribbon buy signal. The analyst added that “an explosive rally” follows whenever this happens. Indeed, this is bullish for BTC as the hash ribbon flashing a buy signal suggests that miners’ capitulation might be done or at least has cooled off.
