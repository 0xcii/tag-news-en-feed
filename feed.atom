This latest proposal joins a growing list of proposals that have been put forward in a bid to restore LUNC to its previous highs. 
 
An Overview Of The Rejected LUNC Proposal
 
The proposal titled ‘(Signal Prop) Investigate EVM functionality’ was seeking to gain the community’s approval to open up the Terra platform to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). That would have possibly led to the Terra chain becoming interoperable with a number of chains that already exist under the EVM umbrella. 
 
 
The proposal also highlighted how Terra, being compatible with Rollups, could increase the network’s processing power as more …]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-18T20:01:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed silver ETFs in the United States, securing their position as the second-largest ETF commodity, in terms of assets under management (AUM). The surge in popularity of Bitcoin ETFs signals a growing acceptance of BTC as a mainstream investment vehicle.



As reported by The Block, Bitcoin's ascent to becoming the second-largest ETF commodity in the U.S. marks a significant milestone for the Bitcoin market. This achievement is attributed to the increasing demand from institutional and retail investors seeking exposure to BTC.
Silver, which has ~$11.5 billion in AUM across five silver ETFs, was passed by spot Bitcoin ETFs which now hold over $28 billion, less than a week after going live.



"Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded silver ETFs in the U.S. in terms of size, driven by the substantial market interest they have received," Bitfinex Head of Derivatives Jag Kooner told The Block. "The level of trading reflects the pent-up demand for these products, and we expect that it will lead to increased liquidity and stability in the market."
This development is particularly noteworthy given silver's traditional status as a prominent commodity investment. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs to the second position underscores Bitcoin's maturation within the financial markets, gaining credibility and recognition as a formidable investment option.
Investors' growing appetite for Bitcoin ETFs reflects a broader trend of diversification within portfolios and a recognition of the unique value proposition offered by BTC. As the Bitcoin market continues to evolve, the achievement of surpassing silver ETFs solidifies Bitcoin's position as a major player in the global financial landscape.]]></summary>

Dencun Upgrade Triumphs on Goerli Testnet After Initial Delay
 
The highly anticipated Dencun upgrade, also known as “Cancun-Deneb,” successfully went live on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17, following a brief four-hour delay caused by a technical glitch.
 
The upgrade encountered an unexpected hiccup as it failed to finalize on the testnet within the expected timeframe. Ethereum core developer Parithosh Jayanthi confirmed the successful finalization of the chain a few hours later, after a bug was identified and swiftly patched.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs, has announced the release of a new phone named Chapter 2. The new phone, whose technical specs have not been announced yet, is projected to be a lower-cost alternative to its Saga sibling, priced at $1,000 on its release date.
Solana Mobile Opens Preorders for Chapter 2
Solana Mobile, a cell phone-oriented subsidiary of Solana Labs, has recently announced plans to produce a new Solana-themed device. The company revealed Chapter 2, a successor to its Saga phone launched last year, that capitalized on the rise of the meme market. While there have been no specs listed yet, Chapter 2 is expected to be a lower-cost alternative to Saga, having been priced significantly lower than it.
The company seeks to take advantage of the phenomenon that started with Saga, which possessed a non-transferable token that became a distribution channel for many airdrops and new projects in the Solana ecosystem. The rise of Bonk, a Solana-based meme coin that allowed Saga owners to claim an airdrop, ignited the demand for the phone, making prices skyrocket to $5,000 in the secondary market. Before, the phone’s price was lowered from $1,000 to $599 due to lack of interest.
While Chapter 2 won’t have this same kind of non-transferable NFT, Solana Mobile announced that there was an “incredible appetite to reach users using this mechanism, and we’re looking forward to building on this experience in Chapter 2,” hinting at the follow-up of the previous experience.
Preorders are already open, and there has been positive feedback for the phone that is being offered at $450, expected to be the full price for early adopters. Solana Mobile declared that the volume of orders pouring in had already exceeded their expectations for the first day. The company aims to launch the phone in the first half of 2025 and to sell at least 100,000 devices.
