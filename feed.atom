        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hut 8, the result of a merger with US Bitcoin Corporation  
(USBTC) last November, has garnered attention due to its diversified business  
model, according to a research report by Benchmark released today (Monday).
A Close Look at Revenue Streams and Crypto Reserves
Benchmark analysts highlighted the company's various revenue  
streams, including self-mining, managed services, hosting, and involvement in  
high-performance computing and artificial intelligence sectors. Initiating coverage on Hut 8, Benchmark issued a buy rating  
with a $12 price target. At the time of publication, Hut 8's shares were  
trading 5.2% higher at $8.47.
The report also noted Hut 8's significant bitcoin holdings,  
ranking second among listed miners as of March 31, with 9,102 bitcoins held in  
reserve. This substantial bitcoin reserve not only provides the company with a  
substantial liquidity cushion but also positions it to benefit from price  
rallies in the cryptocurrency market.

“Hut trades at a discount to its bitcoin mining peers that  
we expect to shrink as the company executes on its self-mining expansion  
plans,” analyst Mark Palmer wrote. “Management has focused on actions aimed at  
reducing the company’s cost of mining bitcoin and its realized cost of energy  
and increasing its cash flow.”
Hut 8's crypto holdings are valued at approximately $592  
million, which accounts for about 82% of its market capitalization.

President of Bitcoin Magazine, Mike Germano, has dared me to publish this rant with the following meme:

ZKasino Accused Of Diverting Funds And Deceiving Investors
 
Trouble began brewing for ZKasino in March when ZigZag, a rival decentralized exchange, leveled serious accusations. ZigZag claims ZKasino not only lied about its funding but also diverted funds meant for development into personal pockets. The accusations don’t end there.
 
ZKasino allegedly failed to pay contractors who helped build the platform, further eroding trust.
