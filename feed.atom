        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance has introduced spot copy trading to enable  
traders to replicate expert trading strategies. The new feature enables users  
to automatically replicate the trades of lead traders. Unlike futures trading,  
which involves leverage and heightened risk, spot trading offers a more  
straightforward, Binance said in a statement today (Wednesday).
Up to 10 Lead Traders
This development followed the launch of Binance’s  
futures copy trading. To use the latest feature, users must select a lead  
trader and allocate investment funds. It enables users to diversify their  
portfolios and track performance with the ability to copy up to 10 lead traders  
simultaneously.
On the other hand, lead traders can monetize their  
expertise by earning a share of profits from their copy traders and a commission on trading fees. The new feature displays information about the performance of lead traders and their strategies. According to Binance, this promotes trust and confidence in the platform while also offering learning  
opportunities for users.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Over 16,000 BTC Left The Coinbase Platform In The Past Day
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, Coinbase has observed a huge outflow for the seventh time this year. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “exchange outflow,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin leaving the wallets attached to a centralized exchange.
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means that the investors are currently withdrawing large amounts from the platform in question. Generally, holders take their coins out of the custody of these central entities whenever they plan to hold onto them for extended periods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jim Cramer, the outspoken host of CNBC’s Mad Money, has caused a stir in the financial sector by endorsing Bitcoin (BTC) over MicroStrategy stock (MSTR). This recommendation follows despite MSTR’s notable year-to-date performance of 85%, compared to Bitcoin’s 125% gain.
 
 
Cramer’s endorsement, however, is met with a dose of skepticism. The financial guru is known for his sometimes-inaccurate predictions, with some even claiming his recommendations have the opposite effect – a phenomenon known as the “Inverse Cramer” theory.
 
MicroStrategy Doubles Down On Bitcoin
 
While Cramer throws shade at MicroStrategy, the company remains a staunch Bitcoin advocate. CEO Michael Saylor is a vocal “Bitcoin Maxi,” holding a significant personal stake in the cryptocurrency and spearheading the company’…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[El Salvador has mined nearly 474 bitcoins worth around $29 million since September 2021 using geothermal energy from the Tecapa volcano, official data revealed. This boosts the country's total bitcoin holdings to 5,750 BTC valued at over $360 million.

JUST IN: 🇸🇻 El Salvador mined nearly 474 #bitcoin worth $29 million using volcano-fueled geothermal power in last three years, Reuters reports. pic.twitter.com/bBACoe9GzM
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 15, 2024
 
 
 
The renewable energy mining operation is a collaborative effort between El Salvador and bitcoin mining firms like Foundry USA, Antpool, ViaBTC, F2Pool, and Binance Pool. It utilizes the geothermal power from Tecapa, one of El Salvador's many active volcanoes.
Of the 102 megawatts generated by the state-owned geothermal power plant beside the volcano, 1.5 megawatts go toward Bitcoin mining. President Nayib Bukele has installed 300 specialized mining processors to facilitate the process.
El Salvador made headlines in 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. Despite criticism from the IMF and others, Bukele has remained committed to Bitcoin, with a Bitcoin mining operation powered by volcano-fueled geothermal energy embodying this forward-thinking approach.

The country's mining accomplishments stand in stark contrast to the scrutiny bitcoin miners face worldwide over energy usage. By tapping geothermal energy from Tecapa, El Salvador provides a renewable model for potential adoption elsewhere.
The $29 million mined demonstrates the substantial, real-world value unlocked by El Salvador's status as the first Bitcoin nation. As more renewable mining comes online globally, the country's volcanic model provides an ambitious precedent.]]></summary>

The recent halving cut the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, meaning miners now receive half as much for verifying transactions and mining new blocks. As noted in a recent report by Kaiko, miner revenues have plummeted since the halving, and miners are beginning to feel the pressure. 
 
Bitcoin Under Increased Pressure
 
Bitcoin miners largely rely on two revenue streams to keep operating: the mining reward and transaction fees. The Bitcoin market is cyclical and each halving has historically led to an increase in selling pressure from the miners. Data shows that the recent April halving has led to a fall in the Bitcoin hash rate with mining profitabilit…]]></summary>
