        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trading desk QCP Capital recently published its 2023 crypto forecast on their latest edition of “Just Crypto.” The firm highlighted this past year’s key moments, their potential impact going into a new year, and possible future digital assets and the global market. 
 
 
The report points out 2022’s year-to-date return for global assets. The market has experienced its worst-performing year for benchmark assets, such as Bitcoin, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and others.
 
Except for Natural Gas, other assets saw their worst losses since the 1970s. Bitcoin (BTC) alone crashed over 70% from its all-time high, while Ethereum (ETH) saw a 72% loss. This negative performance “was a by-product of the sharpest rate hike cycle in recent history” by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).

This is an opinion editorial by Stephan Livera, host of the “Stephan Livera Podcast” and managing director of Swan Bitcoin International.
There are metaphors and analogies for Bitcoin that you may have heard on podcasts or read from various articles or books — and this is not meant to criticize the entire practice of using metaphors or analogies to pique people’s interest in Bitcoin — but having a bad framework for understanding Bitcoin can cause errors in how we reason about it from there. If people take the metaphors too literally, they inevitably make mistakes in their reasoning about Bitcoin. 
First, let’s consider this quotation on whether all metaphors are wrong:

MicroStrategy will release software applications and solutions powered by the Bitcoin Lightning Network in 2023.
MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor spoke about his company’s plans in a Twitter Spaces room on Wednesday, shedding light on some of the offerings currently in the works at the software firm.
Saylor mentioned that as part of his transition from CEO to executive chairman, the company’s Bitcoin arm has been able to have a deeper focus on ways it can not only buy and hold BTC but also contribute to the ecosystem. As it seeks to branch out of regular software applications and into Bitcoin, MicroStrategy can leverage its existing knowledge to provide enterprises with tooling for the Bitcoin and Lightning ecosystem.
"We want to make it possible for any enterprise to spin up Lighting infrastructure in an afternoon" and onboard thousands of employees or customers, Saylor explained. "We want to plug it into enterprise technology and make it a marketing strategy for any forward thinking CMO."
Areas that MicroStrategy is exploring for Lightning services include online content monetization, enterprise marketing, web paywalls, and internal corporate controls. Every chief marketing officer should be able give away satoshis –– Bitcoin’s smaller denomination unit –– as incentive for customers to post reviews or give feedback, Saylor said.
"We have teams working on it and are looking to bring something out by next year. We expect to show something in the first quarter."
Saylor also said in the Twitter Spaces conversation that MicroStrategy’s upcoming Bitcoin event will feature a "Lightning for corporations" agenda, which should dive deeper into the company’s plans for how it wants to explore and contribute to the ecosystem and drive greater adoption.]]></summary>
