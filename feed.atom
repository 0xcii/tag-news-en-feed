        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the turbulent macroeconomic landscape marked by clashes in Ukraine and Israel, and with the Fed’s Jerome Powell alluding to persistent and escalated interest rates, the 10-year Treasury note has soared to 5% — a milestone not seen since 2007. Amid this whirlwind, both gold and silver have enjoyed a surge, paralleling the ascent of the crypto world. In contrast, equities have faced a challenging week, with the Dow Jones plummeting over 200 points just ahead of Friday’s closing bell.

In a series of posts made on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Morgan stated that he “sincerely” wishes the Commission “all the worst” in the penalties phase of the litigation and hoped that the court awards the “smallest penalties possible.”

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-sol-rallies-towards-30-following-33-surge-in-price/"/>
        <updated>2023-10-21T14:05:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana has undoubtedly been one of this week’s biggest gainers, with price rallying by as much as 33% in recent days. The move comes as the global crypto market cap remained mostly in the green to start the weekend. Chainlink was another big mover, hitting a three-week high.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was on the cusp of entering the $30.00 level on Saturday, as bullish momentum continued to intensify.
 
SOL/USD peaked at $29.74 to start the weekend, following a low at $26.39 the day prior.
 
Today’s move saw solana climb to its strongest point since July 14, when price hit a high of $32.40.
 
 
Overall, solana has risen by as much as 33% in the past seven-day period, with today’s surge leading to yet another breakout on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Price strength climbed beyond a ceiling at 74.00 earlier in the day, and is now at a reading of 78.90.
 
As a result of SOL now being significantly overbought, there is a chance that bears could be looming waiting to send the price lower.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) also surged considerably higher to start the weekend, colliding with a key resistance level in the process.
 
After trading at a low of $7.54 on Friday, LINK/USD peaked at $8.15 earlier in Saturday’s session.
 
This level has acted as a price ceiling since late July, and today’s rally is the first time LINK has hit this point since October 1.
 
 
Saturday’s move came following a breakout of a resistance level at 59.00 on the RSI, with price strength now residing at 64.71.
 
70.00 is the likely target for current bulls, and should they reach this desired level, LINK could be trading around $8.50.

        <updated>2023-10-21T12:54:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin traded around the $30,000 region to start the weekend, as markets remained optimistic that an ETF approval could be looming. This has been the topic of the week, with many speculating how high crypto markets could surge on such potential news. Ethereum slipped from Friday’s peak.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was hovering marginally below the $30,000 level on Saturday as a section of bulls looked to seize this week’s profits.
 
Following a peak at $30,104.09 on Friday, BTC/USD has fallen to a current low of $29,816.64 during today’s session.
 
Despite the decline, the world’s largest cryptocurrency remains higher than yesterday’s low at the $29,376.12 mark.
 
 
The easing of momentum comes as the relative strength index (RSI) continued its stay in overbought territory, with a present reading of 73.17.
 
This is the highest point the index has tracked at since February, giving some traders concerns of a potential pullback.
 
Should this occur in the coming days, bears will likely look to push bitcoin to the $29,000 level, which seems to be the next visible floor.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also edged lower to start the weekend, however remains above the $1,600 level.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,593.45 earlier in the day, however bulls then pushed price to a high of $1,610.11.
 
Overall, ethereum traders appear to still be targeting its long-term floor of $1,650, with today’s decline a possible pitstop towards this point.
 
 
Unlike bitcoin above, ETH’s price strength has yet to climb into the overbought mark, and is currently tracking at 51.76.
 
This is slightly above a ceiling at 50.00, with the next firm resistance point around the 60.00 region.
 
In the event bulls push for this point, ethereum will almost certainly be trading above $1,650.
