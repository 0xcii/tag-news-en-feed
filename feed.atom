        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[House Bill 690, “No Cryptocurrency Payments to State,” would stop citizens of North Carolina from paying the state using bitcoin.
 
         
         
         
         
    
The General Assembly of North Carolina has introduced a bill that would ban the usage of bitcoin as payment to the state or state agencies. 
According to a source familiar with the matter, the original intent of the introduction of the bill was to prevent the usage of CBDCs in the state — however, the wording in the bill encompasses cryptocurrencies and bitcoin instead of CBDCs, and appears to be a direct anti-bitcoin and cryptocurrency usage bill. 
The bill, which carries the short title of “No Cryptocurrencies Payments to State,” and is sponsored by House Representatives Warren and Brody, provides two definitions. 
It defines cryptocurrency as, “digital or virtual currency that relies on cryptography to effect transfers and a decentralized network to record transactions,” and a state agency as “any institution, bureau, board, commission, officer or political subdivision of the State.” 
The bill then proclaims that “no State agency shall accept a payment using cryptocurrency,” and that the “act is effective when it becomes law.”
Although short, the bill would be a step in the wrong direction for the state, which just recently saw other legislation pushed forward to halt bitcoin mining operations in the county encompassing the city of Asheville. 
The source familiar with the matter stated that it is likely that this bill will be contested and that efforts to educate legislators will likely take place.]]></summary>

According to a time-based technical analysis theory, however, the crypto market might not be due for a correction for a while longer. Here is a closer look at why. 
 
Time Is On Bulls’ Side
 
Within days of a simple 10% pullback, crypto Twitter is declaring that the bear market is back, and new lows are a guarantee. However, time is on the side of Bitcoin bulls, according to Hurst Cycle Theory. 
 
American engineer JM Hurst created the theory in the 1970s, and it consists of eight key principles. The list includes Commonality, Cyclicality, Summation, Harmonicity, Synchronicity, Proportionality, Nominality, and Variation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
