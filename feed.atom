        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin Argentina, an NGO focused on promoting Bitcoin, is offering a virtual training course called "Introduction to Lightning Network."
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the course aims to educate participants on the operation and development possibilities of the Layer 2 solution that operates on top of the Bitcoin network. 
Jimena Vallone, the executive director of Bitcoin Argentina, stated, "With the Bitcoin Argentina NGO, we want to bring about knowledge about this technology and generate practical and theoretical spaces that allow professionals, specialists, users and interested parties to explore its uses and potential."
The course, starting on May 23, will be taught by prominent specialists in the field, including Nicolás Bourbon, Francisco Calderon, Federico Andragnes and members of Librería de Satoshi, Laura Medina and Gustavo Torres. The curriculum will cover introductory aspects of Bitcoin, the mining process, the structure and operation of the Lightning Network, the technological implications for network growth, digital wallets, transactions and fraud prevention.
Bitcoin Argentina has previously organized the Lightning Hackday in Buenos Aires, which received a positive response from participants. Vallone expressed the organization's motivation behind the training course, saying, "We want to provide the necessary tools so that more and more people can learn about the potential of decentralized technologies and the financial innovation that began with Bitcoin in 2009."
Interested individuals can register for the course directly or via the NGO's website, with limited spots available. Participants will receive a certificate of attendance upon completion of the program.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-05-15T20:39:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Midway through May and bitcoin has mostly fallen lower, as markets digested several key pieces of economic data. The headline was another rate hike by the Federal Reserve, which came as U.S. non-farm payrolls rose marginally higher than expected. Heading into the last fortnight of the month, could bulls be on the brink of returning?
 
Current Market Status
 

 
At the halfway point of May, bitcoin has fallen to a two-month low, as market sentiment shifted bearish, following April’s strong gains.
 

 
With several key data points all being released in a short window, it was somewhat expected that price uncertainty would be present.
 

 
The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points, days after non-farm payrolls rose to 253,000, versus expectations of 180,000.
 

 
Since then, inflation fell to 4.9% in April, with many still uncertain as to what the Federal Reserve will do during June’s meeting.
 

 

 
May Outlook
 

 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a low of $25,810 last Friday, which came after a breakout occurred at a key price floor of $26,500.
 

 
This move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency plunge to its weakest point since March 17, when the price was below $25,000.
 

 
Since then, BTC has somewhat rebounded, climbing to a peak of $27,527.51 earlier in today’s session.
 

 

 

 
From the chart, one of the catalysts for this move was the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which rose above a ceiling at 42.00.
 

 
The index is now tracking at 44.66, with bitcoin reentering its own support point at $27,500, with bulls seemingly targeting $28,000 in the near term.
 

 
A big test will be what happens when the RSI reaches a ceiling at 48.00, should it move beyond this, not only will BTC be above $28,000, however, there is a good chance that it could hit $30,000 before the month’s end.
 

 
Where will bitcoin end the month? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.]]></summary>
