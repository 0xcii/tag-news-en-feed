        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, JPMorgan Chase UK, a standalone digital banking entity in the UK since 2021, delivered surprising news. They announced that their customers would no longer have the option to purchase crypto using Chase UK debit cards or via bank transfers. 
 
While such decisions aren’t entirely unprecedented, the rationale provided by the bank, concerns explicitly about rising digital currency-related frauds, raised eyebrows, especially within the community.
 
Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, one of the largest digital currency exchanges in the world, didn’t mince his words when expressing his displeasure. 
 
During an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday, the CEO criticized the decision, emphasizing that private entities should not be in the business of “sidelining” an …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Su Zhu, a founding member of the now-insolvent Three Arrows Capital, was apprehended in Singapore at Changi Airport on Friday, as per the firm’s liquidator, Teneo. Zhu received a four-month prison sentence for failing to cooperate in the bankruptcy proceedings, Teneo revealed.
 
Crackdown at Changi Airport: 3AC’s Su Zhu Detained, Associate Kyle Davies Fugitive
 
Teneo, overseeing the liquidation of Three Arrows Capital, reported that co-founder Su Zhu was seized and sentenced to four months’ incarceration. His associate, Kyle Davies, remains at large; however, Teneo confirmed he was given an identical penalty.
 
Zhu allegedly tried to flee Singapore when he was intercepted at Changi Airport, situated approximately 25 miles east of Singapore’s Downtown Core. The Singapore court decreed that Zhu and Davies had not been collaborating with the liquidation procedure – an issue previously reported by the media months prior to his apprehension.
 
 
The defunct Singapore-based cryptocurrency hedge fund once supervised over $10 billion in assets at its height. However, a confluence of perilous trading tactics, Terra’s collapse, and plummeting cryptocurrency values obliterated the firm’s assets. Consequently, 3AC declared bankruptcy and was mandated to liquidate by a British Virgin Islands court on June 27, 2022.
 
Squawk Box posted on X that Kyle Davies, the co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, was asked if he was in Bali because Indonesia is one of seven countries that will not extradite him to the United States. While that interview was in November 2022, Davies is believed to be still in Bali.

However, one prominent BTC trader, known as Dave the Wave on the social media platform X, is offering a reassuring perspective. According to Dave, the conditions that led to the 2019 fakeout rally are unlikely to repeat themselves in the current market cycle.
 
The 2019 fakeout rally left many Bitcoin investors disappointed. It was characterized by a sudden breakout that sent BTC prices soaring, only to see them crash back down just as rapidly.
 
 
This roller-coaster ride was attributed to Bitcoin spending only a short time in the “buy zone” before experiencing the wild price swings.

The only concrete part of the protocol idea specified was how to handle token movement and allocations. It is a very simple proposal using OP_RETURN in each transaction to facilitate assigning tokens to a specific UTXO with an output index, a token amount field, and a token ID number. That's it.

Ripple, the company behind XRP, recently introduced a “Clawback” amendment to the XRP Ledger, which would allow issuers to maintain control over their issued assets.
 
Background Of The Rumor
 
Rumors are very rampant in the crypto industry, and the XRP Ledger has emerged as the latest victim. Developers recently introduced an XLS-39d Clawback mechanism in the XRP Ledger which would allow issuers to regain funds from a trustline in case of malicious activity. This feature has caused confusion and rumors about whether it applies to the XRP price.

Recent data from Hash Index has shed new light on this discussion by revealing that public miners make up just 28% of Bitcoin’s global hash rate. This statistic challenges the notion that miners hold central control over the network, emphasizing the pivotal role of nodes in the ecosystem.
 
 
While this data showcases the influence of public miners, it’s crucial to acknowledge that potential centralization points still exist within mining pools. Approximately 70% of the network’s hash rate is driven by private entities, as reported by Hashrate Index.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was one of Friday’s notable crypto gainers, rallying to a one-month high earlier in today’s session. Bullish sentiment returned to end the week, with the global market cap trading nearly 1.5% higher as of writing. Solana also surged, moving back above the $20.00 mark.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was one of today’s biggest movers, climbing by as much as 5% earlier in the day.
 
Following a low of $0.5036 yesterday, XRP/USD raced to a peak of $0.5455 during Friday’s session.
 
This resulted in the token hitting its highest point since August 29, which is the last time price hit a ceiling of $0.5490.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that the move came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose beyond a ceiling of its own at 56.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 58.67, with the next visible point of support near the 60.00 mark.
 
In the event the 60.00 ceiling is broken, there is a good chance that XRP will climb beyond $0.5500.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
In addition to XRP, solana (SOL) also rallied strongly on Friday, rising above $20.00 in the process.
 
SOL/USD climbed to a high of $20.32 earlier in today’s session, following Thursday’s low at $19.22.
 
This surge has seen solana hit a nine-day high, which comes after three straight days of bullish momentum.
 
 
Overall, the uptrend comes as the 10-day (red) moving average rose above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Bulls are likely now targeting a higher resistance level of $21.00, which would result in a four-week high.
