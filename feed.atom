Despite the recent contraction forcing the world’s most valuable coin to spot rates, exciting trends are developing, pointing to confidence, especially among whales.
 
Whales Rapidly Accumulating Bitcoin
 
According to the IntoTheBlock data on July 19, whales are doubling down. As data shows, the number of addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC are rapidly buying, scooping more coins and pushing the figure to a two-year high. This swell in buying pressure means that whales, mainly comprising institutions and deep-pocketed investors, are confident of Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.
