        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) announced new rules that will require companies to account for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin at fair value, according to a Bloomberg report. The rules are set to go into effect on December 15, 2024, but companies will be able to apply them earlier than that.
Under the new guidelines, which are the first of their kind in the United States, businesses will need to disclose the value of cryptocurrencies based on their market prices at the end of each reporting period. This move aims to provide greater transparency and accuracy in financial reporting, acknowledging the volatile nature of digital assets like Bitcoin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase  
is expanding its global footprint by improving spot markets for perpetual  
futures traders to enhance the overall trading experience. The approach  
includes the strategic placement of servers worldwide to reduce latency. In the  
initial phase, Coinbase will list BTC-USDC and ETH-USDC pairs on December 14,  
exclusively through API access for non-US institutional clients.
Global  
Expansion: Coinbase's Approach to Spot Market Improvement
Since  
its launch in May 2023, Coinbase International Exchange has witnessed growth,  
welcoming over 100 institutions and achieving $10 billion in Q3 perpetual  
futures trading volume. Noteworthy features include perpetual futures for  
eligible retail users, 15 listed perpetual contracts covering 70% of the  
market, and increased maximum leverage of 10x for all contracts.
In  
the initial phase, Coinbase prioritizes building liquidity and establishing a  
robust foundation. Subsequent phases will extend the product to retail users,  
introduce additional assets, and incorporate features supporting new trading  
strategies and enhancing capital efficiency. This initiative aligns with Phase  
II of Coinbase's "Go Broad, Go Deep" strategy, emphasizing  
international expansion and innovative product development.
A  
pivotal aspect of Coinbase is its strategic response to  
the uncertain US regulatory landscape. The exchange aims to provide an  
alternative for those cautious about engaging with US-based platforms.

He suggested that the outcome of the case was already obvious even before the trial began. Mills also gave an insight into why he took on the case despite his reservations. 
 
Sam Bankman-Fried Fraud Case Was “Unwinnable”
 
In an interview with Bloomberg, Mills said that pre-trial rulings by the judge and powerful testimony of the prosecution witnesses made the case “unwinnable” for SBF. Judge Lewis Kaplan (the Judge who oversaw the case) had made several pretrial rulings ahead of the trial, with a majority of them going against Bankman-Fried.
 
 
The witness testimonies that Mills was also referring to included that of members of SBF’s former ‘inner cir…]]></summary>
