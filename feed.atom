        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the central value propositions of Bitcoin is that no matter what happens, if you pay a high enough fee some miner out there in the world will confirm your transaction. In other words, Bitcoin is censorship resistant. There is a very good reason that the phrase “censorship resistant” is the wording you hear whenever this topic comes up, not “censorship proof.” Any individual miner can censor whatever they want, in the sense that they can refuse to include something in any block they mine themselves. They cannot, however, prevent other miners from including that transaction in their own blocks whenever they find one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FTX's claims prices have experienced a remarkable  
surge, reaching almost 80 cents to the dollar amid an anticipated hearing of a  
dispute between the bankrupt crypto exchange and its creditors.  
According to a report by Cointelegraph, FTX is  
advocating for a refund process based on the market prices for November 2022,  
while creditors are pushing for a payment system based on the number of lost  
tokens, regardless of market values.
FTX's Pricing Proposal 
FTX's proposal to reimburse creditors based on  
cryptocurrency prices on the day of its bankruptcy has encountered staunch  
opposition. The clash in perspectives has intensified in the lead-up to the  
estimation hearing, resulting in FTX claim prices skyrocketing to nearly 80  
cents on the dollar.
