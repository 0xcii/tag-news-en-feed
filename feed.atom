Although we don’t have exact numbers on Bitcoin adoption globally, we do know that the global average cryptocurrency adoption rate was estimated to be at about 12% in 2022 and that bitcoin currently has about half of the total market cap of the global cryptocurrency market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved towards $31,000 on Wednesday, ahead of June’s inflation report from the United States. Consumer prices are expected to fall to 3.1%, down from May’s reading of 4.0%. Ethereum also edged higher, as the cryptocurrency closed in on the $1,900 mark.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) neared $31,000 in today’s session, as traders were optimistic ahead of upcoming inflation data from the United States.
 
Following a low of $30,358.10 on Tuesday, BTC/USD jumped to an intraday high of $30,831.81 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s move resulted in the world’s largest cryptocurrency breaking out of a key resistance level of $30,800.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Price has since fallen below this point, as the relative strength index (RSI) neared a ceiling at 62.00.
 
The index is now hovering at 61.98, with bulls hoping that there will be a breakout following the release of the consumer price index (CPI).
 
Should this occur, the price target will likely be at a resistance of $31,400.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also edged higher on hump-day, with the price once again closing in on the $1,900 zone.
 
So far today, ETH/USD peaked at $1,895.08, which was nearly 2% higher than Tuesday’s low at $1,863.22.
 
Unlike bitcoin, ethereum’s 14-day RSI has moved beyond its own ceiling of 52.00, and as of writing is tracking at 53.42.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This comes despite the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) being on the cusp of a downward crossover with the blue 25-day MA.
 
A crossover of this kind will likely be a bearish signal, and could prompt traders to abandon previous long positions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd., previously known as HIVE Blockchain, has announced that along with its renaming, the company will be focusing on revenue opportunities with its Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU) cards in cloud compute technology.
HIVE plans to utilize a fleet of 38,000 Nvidia GPUs for computational tasks, expanding its revenue channels while seeking to drive advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the company intends to enter the rental market for GPU server clusters and launch its new service, HIVE Cloud. “This cloud service will empower users with access to a virtual instance of a single GPU, a bare-metal server equipped with up to 10 GPUs, or even clusters of multiple servers to provide an array of computing power,” the press release said. 
Aydin Kilic, president and CEO of HIVE, highlighted the importance of high-performance computing and GPU processing power in today's AI-driven world. Kilic stated, "Training these tools, from ChatGPT to Midjourney, require high-end GPU compute. As businesses adapt to the new AI world, we believe they will seek companies like HIVE to develop their own AI tools."
Executive Chairman Frank Holmes expressed optimism about the potential of GPU computing with Nvidia GPU cards, stating, "We believe the demand has a potential for a high-margin business with annual revenues in the range over $100,000,000."
HIVE Digital Technologies stated that it remains “dedicated to driving innovation with sustainable, ethically-driven technological solutions,” and that its current bitcoin mining operations will continue. The company owns data centers in Canada, Sweden and Iceland.]]></summary>
