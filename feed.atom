        <updated>2023-04-15T14:28:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano rose to a fresh multi-month high on Saturday, as the token surged for a ninth consecutive session. The price is now up by over 15% in that time, cementing its place as the world’s seventh-largest cryptocurrency. Avalanche is also trading higher, hitting a two-month high in the process. 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) once again extended a recent bull run, with the token climbing for a ninth straight day.
 
Following a low of $0.4274 during Friday’s session, ADA/USD rose by as much as 5% today, hitting a peak of $0.4581 in the process.
 
Saturday’s surge has sent ADA to its highest level since September 27, when the price was above $0.4600.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the latest rise in price coincides with the relative strength index (RSI) moving past a key ceiling.
 
The aforementioned point of resistance was at the 72.00 mark, with the index currently tracking at 75.92.
 
Should price strength continue to move higher, an upcoming wall at the 80.00 mark could be a potential stumbling block.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
In addition to ADA, avalanche (AVAX), was another notable gainer in the market to start the weekend.
 
AVAX/USD rallied to an intraday high of $19.51 on Saturday, a day after trading at a low of $18.52.
 
Similar to cardano, today’s move has sent avalanche to a multi-month high, with the token hitting its strongest point since February.
 
 
Overall, AVAX is currently on a seven-day winning streak, which was extended following a breakout of a ceiling at $18.50.
 
Price strength is now at a reading of 66.54, with an upcoming resistance point at the 70.00 mark.
 
Should it reach this target, there is a strong possibility that AVAX will be trading above $20.00.

Bitcoin Difficulty Adjusted Puell Multiple Is Yet To Break Above 1
 
According to a researcher at the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, miners are still earning around 12% less than the average for the past year. The indicator of interest here is the “puell multiple,” which measures the ratio between the daily Bitcoin miner revenue (in USD) and 365-day moving average (MA) of the same.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than one, it means the miners are currently making more than their average for the past year. During such periods, miners generally find mining to be profitable.
 
On the other hand, values below this threshold imply…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum remained above $2,100 to start the weekend, despite crypto markets moving into consolidation. Following this week’s gains, traders have seemingly started to secure gains, with the global market cap down by 0.52% as of writing this. Bitcoin has fallen below yesterday’s peak above $31,000.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved back below the $31,000 level on Saturday, as cryptocurrency markets consolidated to start the weekend.
 
Following a high of $31,005.61 on Friday, BTC/USD dropped to a low of $30,044.50 earlier in today’s session.
 
Yesterday’s peak saw bitcoin climb to its highest level since June 7, which has seemingly prompted bulls to secure gains.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the decline in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a ceiling at 71.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 70.18, which is marginally higher than a floor at 68.00.
 
In the event the RSI drops below 70.00 there is a good chance that even more bulls could vacate earlier positions, in order to protect recent profits.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Although relatively lower than Friday’s high, ethereum (ETH) continued above $2,100 so far in Saturday’s session.
 
ETH/USD fell to an intraday bottom at $2,049.08 earlier in the day, however, has since recovered and is currently trading at $2,103.18.
 
This is marginally lower than yesterday’s peak of $2,120.59, which saw ETH trade at its strongest point since last May.
 
 
Similar to bitcoin, ethereum, which is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, has collided with a ceiling on the RSI indicator.
 
The aforementioned point of resistance at 75.00 was hit on Friday, with the index now tracking at 74.88.
 
Should ethereum bulls move beyond this point, there is a possibility that prices could head closer to $2,200 this weekend.

        <updated>2023-04-15T10:42:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Friday, Chia Network Inc. announced that it had submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-1 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), requesting an initial public offering (IPO). The blockchain network company, founded by Bittorrent creator Bram Cohen, will initiate the IPO after the U.S. securities regulator approves the filing.
 
Bittorrent Creator’s Chia Aims for an IPO
 
Bram Cohen’s Chia network intends to go public and took a step in that direction on Friday, April 14, 2023, when the firm submitted a Form S-1 filing with the SEC. The blockchain and cryptocurrency project, launched in 2018, leverages storage for consensus through a mechanism called Proof of Space and Time (PoST), in contrast to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW). PoST uses hard disk space as the foundation for its consensus algorithm. Chia’s COO Gene Hoffman indicated that the company had been focused on an IPO since May 2021.
 
 
On April 14, Chia announced that it had confidentially submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-1 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed initial public offering of its common stock. Chia’s move follows a number of crypto tokens being declared unregistered securities by the SEC. Chia has raised a total of $71.12 million and obtained $61 million in May 2021, in a Series D financing round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Richmond Global Ventures.
 
 
Chia’s native token XCH rose 14.2% on the news, and during the past 24 hours, it has been trading at a range of $39.56 to $45.38 per coin. Over the last seven days, Chia’s XCH has risen 19.3% against the U.S. dollar. However, XCH is 97% lower than the all-time high it set on May 15, 2021, when it reached $1,645 per unit.
