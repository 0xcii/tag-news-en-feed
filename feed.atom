Due to its liberal licensing regime, Hong Kong could make a worthy destination for a visual asset hub. Although Hong Kong has accepted the industry, there could be other factors that businesses might have to consider.
 
 
Last month, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) released a proposal encompassing the licensing regime for crypto exchanges. The proposed licensing regime is supposed to take effect in June.
 
These changes in the licensing regime shall be aligned so that Hong Kong can become the next digital asset hub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EUR/USD raced to a six-week high on Thursday, as markets continued to react to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 25-basis-point rate hike. The greenback was lower across the board, falling versus several G7 currencies, including the British pound.
 
EUR/USD
 
On Thursday, the world’s most traded currency pair rose for a sixth straight session, as markets continued to digest yesterday’s rate hike.
 
The Federal Reserve opted to increase rates by 0.25%, despite recent uncertainty in the banking sector.
 
Following the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that “FOMC participants don’t see rate cuts this year, it is not our baseline expectations.”
 
 
Overall, it appears that lowering inflation remains the priority for the Fed, with the U.S. Treasury exploring ways to guarantee client deposits should any further banks face liquidity issues.
 

 
EUR/USD rose to an intraday high of $1.0929 in today’s session, which is its highest rate since February 3.

According to the recent report, the exchange received a Wells notice from the SEC, suggesting a looming lawsuit for securities law violation.
 
Meanwhile, Stuart Aldorety, lead counsel to Ripple, tweeted his opinion of the SEC’s Wells notice to Coinbase.
 
SEC Brooding A Lawsuit On Coinbase After Wells Notice?
 
On March 22, Coinbase confirmed receipt of a Wells Notice from the SEC, alleging the crypto exchange violated securities law. The Wells Notice is a letter expressing the commission’s suspicion regarding Coinbase’s violations. Typically, the notice should allow the recipient to respond to the claims convincing the watchdog otherwise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, the Arbitrum airdrop claiming process went live and ARB markets dropped more than 85% lower than pre-IOU market prices recorded the day before. Arbitrum airdropped just over a billion ARB tokens, or 11.6% of the total supply. At noon ET, more than 474 million tokens had been claimed.
 
Wild Volatility for ARB Token: Prices Range from $1.10 to $11.80 per Unit Following Airdrop
 
At block height 16,890,400, around 9 a.m. ET, the Arbitrum airdrop claiming process began and distribution of 11.6% of the supply started. The day before, Bitcoin.com News reported on exchanges listing IOU ARB markets just before the real ARB token launched on Thursday. At that time, ARB’s value in U.S. dollars was more than 85% higher. At the time of writing, a single ARB was trading for $1.25 per unit. The ARB token has seen wild volatility over the last 12 hours with prices ranging from $1.10 to $11.80 per ARB.

ARB’s price has been down despite bitcoin nearing $29,000 and ethereum rising to $1,855 per unit. ARB trade volume is much higher than the ARB IOU volumes recorded yesterday at $8.7 million. In the past 24 hours, roughly $849.81 million in ARB volume has been recorded. The top three crypto exchanges with the most ARB trading activity are Binance, Okx, and Bybit.
 
 
With 1.275 billion ARB in circulation, 474 million have been claimed by 244,255 unique addresses. Thirty-nine percent of eligible addresses have been claimed and more than 40% of the airdropped ARB has been received by recipients. At $1.25 per unit, ARB’s overall market valuation was $1.6 billion on Thursday afternoon at noon ET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent study by the United States Treasury revealed that the introduction of central bank digital currency (CBDC) could potentially destabilize the banking sector while also having the potential to boost household welfare. 
 
Before now, US lawmakers expressed dissatisfaction with developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In a new bill, the board noted that the Fed has no authority to develop and issue a central bank digital currency, as it may affect the privacy protection of digital asset investors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin was one of Thursday’s biggest gainers, as prices rose by as much as 13% in today’s session. This came despite the global crypto market cap shifting lower, down 1.65% as of writing. Dogecoin was also higher, as the meme coin rebounded from Wednesday’s losses.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) has been one of Thursday’s biggest gainers, as prices rose by as much as 13% in today’s session.
 
LTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $91.70 in today’s session, a day after falling to a low of $79.95.
 
As a result of the move, LTC climbed to its strongest point since March 3, when the token reached a peak of $95.49.
 
 
Overall, the move has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average closer to an upwards crossover with the 25-day (blue) moving average.
 
Although some will be anticipating a cross, there appears to be a hurdle in place, which comes in the form of a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 55.35, which is marginally below the aforementioned resistance zone at 56.00.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was also higher in today’s session, as the meme coin rose to a five-day high.
 
Following a low of $0.07213 on Wednesday, DOGE/USD rose to a peak of $0.07819 earlier today.
 
The move saw DOGE rebound from yesterday’s losses, hitting its highest point since last Saturday in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s surge has sent the 10-day (red) moving average to the brink of a cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
This typically is a sign of upcoming rallies, which like with LTC, will have to come once the RSI breaks free of a current point of resistance.
 
Price strength is currently tracking at 51.38, which is slightly below a ceiling at the 52.00 mark.
