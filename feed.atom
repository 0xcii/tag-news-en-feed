        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metaplanet, a Japanese public company that started as a hotel operator, announced it purchased another ¥400 million ($2.5 million) in Bitcoin. This continues the firm's strategy of adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.

JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japanese public company Metaplanet buys another ¥400 million worth of #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/mT4cPKEcSP
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 8, 2024
  
  
  
Despite the slumping Bitcoin market, Metaplanet revealed it acquired 42.466 more Bitcoin on July 8th. This brings its total holdings to around 203 Bitcoin purchased for ¥2.05 billion ($12.7 million) — an average price of ¥10 million ($62,000) per coin.
Metaplanet is mimicking MicroStrategy, the U.S. software firm's Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has amassed over 200,000 Bitcoin, now worth $15 billion, making it the largest corporate holder.
Its stock price has often mirrored Bitcoin's fluctuations, with investors using it as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure. 
The Japanese company said buying Bitcoin helps minimize exposure to the weakening yen amid prolonged low interest rates. This approach also provides domestic investors Bitcoin access through a public firm with preferable tax treatment.
The yen has tumbled dramatically in 2022, dropping to lows against the dollar and euro not seen in decades. The Bank of Japan has maintained a loose monetary policy in contrast to global tightening.
While amounts remain small so far, its continued purchases show commitment even amid market turmoil. As "Asia's MicroStrategy," Metaplanet is positioning itself to ride future waves in Bitcoin adoption.

Although there were signs of recovery over the weekend, the value tumbled this morning (Monday) as the Asian markets opened. What is the cause of this dip? Is it due to the expected repayment from Mt. Gox or the Germans offloading their Bitcoin stash? Additionally, the US Feds’ decisions on rate cuts cannot be ignored.

Bitcoin peaked at almost $74,000 earlier this year, boosted by the approval of the long-awaited spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. However, due to periodic volatility, the cryptocurrency is trading around $57,500, down by around 23 percent.

Speaking from his ranch, he described the ongoing efforts and milestones reached in what has been a significant journey for the blockchain platform.
 
Cardano Chang Hard Fork Is Almost Ready
 
Hoskinson started by reflecting on the challenges and achievements of the past years. “It’s been a very long last few years,” he acknowledged, noting that despite getting “jammed up in a few things,” the ecosystem has managed to overcome these obstacles, particularly in governance. The completion of all elements of CIP 1694 was highlighted as a critical accomplishment, taking about two years to final…]]></summary>
