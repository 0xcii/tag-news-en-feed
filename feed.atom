BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, filed an application to register  
a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, spurring two  
more major issuers to pursue similar financial instruments. Yesterday (Tuesday),  
both Invesco and WisdomTree announced their intention to create their own spot  
Bitcoin ETFs. 
Despite falling short of its previous attempts, BlackRock's recent move has boosted hopes that  
US regulators might finally approve such an instrument this time around.
