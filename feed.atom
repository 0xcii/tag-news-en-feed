        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-shib-bnb-rebound-from-key-price-floors-on-tuesday/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-23T16:11:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu climbed to a two-week high on Tuesday, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. The meme coin rose by as much as 2% in today’s session, as the global crypto market cap surged by the same amount. BNB was another notable gainer today.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) rose to a multi-week high in today’s session, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets.
 
Following a low of $0.000008759 to start the week, SHIB/USD jumped to a peak of $0.000009067 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, SHIB climbed to its strongest point since May 10, when price hit a high of $0.00000930.
 
 
One of the catalysts of the surge appears to be a breakout which took place on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
The index moved beyond the ceiling of 40.00, and as of writing is now tracking at 40.83.
 
Should bulls continue to control sentiment, there is a chance they target an upcoming ceiling of 46.00 on the index.
 
 
BNB
 
BNB was another notable gainer on Tuesday, as prices rebounded from a key support level.
 
BNB/USD rose to an intraday high of $315.21 in today’s session, 24 hours after hitting a low of $309.13.
 
Overall, this recent run, which has seen BNB climb for two consecutive days, comes after a failed breakout of a floor at $302.00.
 
 
Due to today’s uptrend, the RSI is now on the verge of colliding with a key resistance of 49.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 48.95, with earlier bulls possibly preparing to take profits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opinions and discussions keep floating around the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, and Australian-based attorney Bill Morgan took to Twitter to share insights regarding the Ripple token, XRP. According to Morgan, XRP can’t be a security among all others. 
 
Lawyer Explains How XRP Is Not A Security
 
Bill Morgan pointed to the fact that the ruling of Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court matters a lot in the ongoing case. He explained that XRP would not be categorized as a security if the judge ruled that Ripple’s sales of XRP to On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) customers are not investment contracts and have no indication of profit attached.

Investors Find Other Things To Occupy Their Time
 
Now, when the Ordinals and BRC-20 craze first began, investors flocked to the Bitcoin network which led to a surge in the number of transactions on the network. It wasn’t long until developers were moving this concept to the likes of Dogecoin and Litecoin, both of which operate similarly to the Bitcoin network.
 
 
From this, the DRC-20 tokens were born, allowing for the transfer of fungible tokens on the Dogecoin network just like the Ethereum ERC-20 standard. As their popularity grew, so did the numbe…]]></summary>

Bitcoin mining refers to the process through which new bitcoin is introduced into circulation. The mining process plays a crucial role in confirming new transactions and maintaining the Bitcoin blockchain ledger as an immutable record of transactions. In essence, miners use ASIC hardware to solve complex computational problems, with the first one to find the solution earning a reward of bitcoin before the cycle restarts.

        <updated>2023-05-23T13:08:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded on Tuesday, as a result of weakness in the U.S. dollar, following failed talks to tackle the debt ceiling crisis. President Biden stated, “We reiterated once again that default is off the table and the only way to move forward is in good faith toward a bipartisan agreement.”
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $27,000 on Tuesday, as a result of weakness in the greenback, following failed talks to increase the U.S. debt ceiling.
 
After dropping to a low of $26,714.18 to start the week, BTC/USD surged to a peak of $27,434.68 earlier today.
 
Tuesday’s gains saw bitcoin marginally break out of a resistance level at the $27,300 mark.
 
 
This coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) climbing above a ceiling of its own, at 44.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 47.10, with an upcoming zone of 50.00 a likely target for bulls.
 
Should they reach this point, there is a reasonable chance that bitcoin will trade above $27,600.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also surged higher in today’s session, as prices continued to move away from a key level of support.
 
ETH/USD hit an intraday high of $1,869.34 on Monday, 24 hours removed from trading at a bottom of $1,809.54.
 
The move came as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency bounced away from a recent floor at $1,790.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s surge comes following a slight breakout of a ceiling on the RSI at the 50.00 mark.
 
As of writing, price strength is now tracking at 51.97, with the next visible level of resistance at 55.00.
