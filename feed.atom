        <updated>2023-09-11T19:05:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent appearance on Fox Business, Anthony "Pomp" Pompliano suggested that a significant Bitcoin bull run is on the horizon. Pompliano, a well-known figure in the Bitcoin space, shared his insights on the future of Bitcoin and why he believes it is primed for another surge.
Pompliano began the discussion by highlighting the recent volatility in the market, with Bitcoin experiencing a period of fluctuation in recent months. However, he emphasized that this is not unusual for the market and is part of the asset class's nature. Pompliano stated that such volatility should not deter investors from considering Bitcoin as a long-term investment.
One of the key factors driving Pompliano's optimism is the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. This year, numerous prominent companies, including BlackRock and Fidelity, filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC, signaling a shift in the perception of Bitcoin from a speculative asset to a legit store of value. Pompliano believes a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved by the end of this year, while more institutions also recognize the value of holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.
Pompliano also discussed the potential for Bitcoin to disrupt traditional financial institutions. He argued that Bitcoin's decentralized nature and borderless accessibility could challenge the dominance of central banks and traditional financial intermediaries. While acknowledging the regulatory challenges that Bitcoin faces, Pompliano believes that innovation will ultimately prevail and that Bitcoin will play a significant role in the future of finance.
Anthony Pompliano's optimism about a forthcoming Bitcoin bull run is rooted in the growing institutional adoption, international recognition, and the potential for Bitcoin to reshape the financial landscape. As Bitcoin continues to evolve and mature, it remains a topic of great interest and debate among investors and financial experts alike.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box, former PayPal President David Marcus shared his vision for Bitcoin, aiming to transform it into a global payment network. Marcus, who is the CEO of Lightning Network infrastructure company Lightspark, emphasized the importance of expanding Bitcoin's utility beyond just a store of value.
During the interview, Marcus highlighted the significant strides Bitcoin has made over the past decade, evolving from an obscure digital currency to a recognized store of value and hedge against inflation. However, he argued that Bitcoin could play a much broader role in the global financial ecosystem.
Marcus proposed that Bitcoin has the potential to become a truly global payment network, similar to PayPal but operating on the decentralized Bitcoin network. He e…]]></summary>

But regardless if it does, today’s downside guarantees that a death cross on the daily will trigger – potentially with tonight’s daily close.
 
Much like it sounds, the “death cross” is not a positive sign for the cryptocurrency market. Here is the actual data behind the ominous sounding bearish crossover signal.
 
Betting On The Bearish Bitcoin Death Cross
 
BTCUSD is potentially only hours away from triggering a death cross on the daily chart. This marks the first bearish crossover of 2023 of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which formed the opposite golden cross back in February of this year.
 
The importance of the signal cannot be understated. …]]></summary>

This groundbreaking work delves deep into the essence of currency and commodity to offer a fresh perspective on the financial landscape of the digital age.
Goodwin posits that currency is not the only function of money; it's a technology that acts as a conduit of trust across time and space. When looking at the history of monetary systems, the line between commodity and currency has been the defining linchpin. However, the dollar, long regarded as the emblem of stability, now finds itself facing an unprecedented challenger, thanks to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu started the week by dropping to its lowest point since June, as a red wave swept through cryptocurrency markets. This has pushed the global market cap 1.20% lower at the time of writing. XRP fell by as much as 5%, as Ripple’s battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continued.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB )
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) edged lower on Monday, as the meme coin fell to its weakest point in over two months.
 
SHIB/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.000007028 on Monday, following a high of $0.000007413 the day prior.
 
This was the weakest point that shiba inu has traded at since June 20, when the price bottomed out at $0.00000698.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) fell below a support point at the 34.00 level.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 30.42, with the next visible floor around the 28.00 region.
 
Overall, SHIB has now fallen lower for four consecutive days, and seems to be heading towards the $0.00000680 zone.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, fell by as much as 5% on Monday, as markets continued to react to the latest news surrounding a lawsuit with the SEC.
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission said it would appeal a decision by a U.S. judge not to find Ripple Labs guilty of violating securities laws.
 
XRP/USD dropped to a low of $0.4682 on the news, which came following a high of $0.5007 the day prior.
 
 
As a result of the decline in price, XRP slipped to its weakest point since mid-August, falling below a floor on the RSI in the process.
 
Price strength now sits at 26.82, which is deep in oversold territory, with a lower floor of 23.00 still a possible target for traders.
