        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance.US, the US-incorporated unit of Binance that operates independently from the global parent, laid off two-thirds of its staff, around 200 employees, following the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) action last year, Coindesk reported.
In a recently filed court document, the crypto exchange highlighted that $1 billion in assets were moved from the platform following the regulator's temporary restraining order (TRO). The outflow even wiped out 75 percent of the platform revenue, which led to the layoffs.
“In the immediate aftermath of the TRO, we saw somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 billion of assets flee the platform, crypto, and fiat,” Christopher Blodgett, an executive at Binance.US, said in a deposition in December 2023.
