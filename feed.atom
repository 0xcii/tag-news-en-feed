        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson, has once again reasserted his opinion on a potential partnership between XRP and Cardano’s ADA. His recent comment after a member of the XRP community dug up past remarks that the Cardano founder had made on this same subject.  
 
Why ADA Will Not Work With XRP
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Hoskinson explained that the reason ADA will not partner with XRP is because of the “two years of daily harassment” by the XRP community. He also highlighted the “lack of technical overlap” between both tokens and the “different product market fit” as other reasons why a partnership is unlikely. 
 
 
The Cardano founder mentioned that Ripple (possibly alluding to XRP) was “built for a different purpose.” This is unlike Cardano, Tezoz, Ethereum, Pol…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/revolut-halts-crypto-purchases-for-uk-business-customers-report/"/>
        <updated>2023-12-18T18:48:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revolut will temporarily halt certain cryptocurrency  
services for its business customers in the UK in response to upcoming regulatory  
changes by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
According to a report by City A.M., the fintech firm disclosed its decision to suspend the ability to purchase cryptocurrencies via  
Revolut Business starting January 3, 2024, aligning with the FCA's new  
guidelines on crypto assets.
Navigating Regulatory Changes
Recently, the FCA  
signaled imminent guidelines, compelling Revolut to pause the purchasing option  
for cryptocurrencies through Revolut Business from January 3, 2024. While this  
pause affects buying, business customers retain the ability to hold and sell  
crypto, with no impact on Revolut's Retail customers.
The FCA's impending regulations involve provisions  
aimed at protecting investors in the volatile digital asset space. Central to  
these rules is the introduction of a mandatory 24-hour "cooling off  
period" for investors engaging in crypto transactions. 
Additionally, incentives like "refer a  
friend" bonuses will face a ban. This step seeks to mitigate potential  
speculative behavior in the market. Scheduled to be enforced for registered  
crypto firms from January 8, 2024, the FCA has granted a transition period for  
companies to integrate these features, allowing for necessary adjustments.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an appearance on CNBC today, the CEO of Grayscale Investments, Michael Sonnenshein, shared insights regarding the potential impact of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) on the cryptocurrency market. Sonnenshein highlighted that a spot Bitcoin ETF could "unlock" around "$30 trillion worth of advised wealth."



Sonnenshein discussed the significance of introducing a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States, emphasizing the vast pool of wealth held within advised assets and the substantial opportunity a regulated Bitcoin ETF could present to tap into these resources.
"When we look ahead to the hopeful approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, it really is going to unlock the opportunity to a part of the investment community that for better or worse has been locked out for the opportunity to participate in having Bitcoin exposure in their portfolio," Sonnenshein said. "We're really taking about the advised market here in the US. Which is today, about $30 trillion worth of advised wealth that we hope the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the up-listing of GBTC, will allow for that opportunity and for those investors to partake in it as well."
According to Sonnenshein, the introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF would open the doors for financial advisors and institutional investors to participate in the Bitcoin market more seamlessly. This influx of institutional capital into the market could be substantial, representing a significant step towards mainstream institutional adoption and recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class.
As discussions around approving a spot Bitcoin ETF persist within regulatory circles, Sonnenshein's comments add weight to the potential impact such an ETF could have on the broader financial landscape. The unlocking of vast advised wealth, as envisioned by Sonnenshein, might significantly alter the dynamics of Bitcoin's market participation and pave the way for increased institutional involvement in the space.]]></summary>

Bitcoin Transaction Fees Has Observed A Sharp Increase Recently
 
As explained by analyst James V. Straten in a post on X, the Bitcoin fees have been greater than Ethereum’s recently. The “fee” here naturally refers to the transaction fee that the users on the network have to attach with their transfers as a payment for the chain validators (miners for BTC, stakers for ETH).
 
The total fees earned by the validators in a single day depend on the blockchain conditions on that day. Whenever the network is congested (that is, a large amount of users are making transfers at once), the fees can spike up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitwise, the aspiring applicant for a spot Bitcoin ETF, has unveiled a captivating commercial aimed at advocating for it's upcoming Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
"A word to the wise, from a man of few words. #bitcoinisinteresting", Bitwise said.



The commercial, appears to be targeted towards the older generations like gen X and baby boomers, with a classy and sophisticated style that those generations are used to watching on the television in between their favorite shows and sports. "You know what's interesting these days? Bitcoin," said the actor in the commercial. "Look for Bitwise, my friends."
This release arrives at a interesting moment as the SEC continues to evaluate numerous applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitwise, along with several other financial firms, has persistently pursued the establishment of a spot Bitcoin ETF, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning Bitcoin market.
While the commercial aims to familiarize a wider audience with the concept of a spot Bitcoin ETF, it is also helping garner support for their application, potentially influencing public opinion and regulatory decisions regarding Bitcoin investment vehicles.
Bitwise remains hopeful that this latest promotional effort will contribute positively to the ongoing discourse surrounding the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, potentially marking a significant milestone in the adoption of Bitcoin within traditional investment portfolios.]]></summary>
