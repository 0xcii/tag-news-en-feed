        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, the crypto community on social media site X (formerly Twitter) speculated that Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, had been released from prison a month before the end of his four-month sentence. However, recent reports have revealed a different story.
 
CZ Shifted To Long Beach Facility
 
Contrary to the circulating rumors, Zhao has not been entirely freed from incarceration. Instead, he has been transferred to an administrative facility in the Greater Los Angeles area just 38 days before his scheduled release from custody.
 
 
According to information from the US Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), Zhao is now classified as an inmate under the Residential Reentry Management (RRM) Long Beach field office, which oversees federal offenders in ce…]]></summary>

Four years after the fondly remembered DeFi summer of 2020, the total value locked (TVL) in protocols can hit an all-time high by early next year.
 
However, the return of DeFi summer rests on two key factors.
 
Lower Ethereum Fees Crucial To Attract Investors
 
Ethereum (ETH) has historically led the DeFi wave, boasting the highest TVL locked into its protocols among all other smart-contract blockchains. According to DeFiLlama, the TVL locked in Ethereum-based protocols currently stands at approximately $50.11 billion.
 
Ethereum is followed by Tron (TRX) and Solana (SOL), with a TVL of $8.27 billion and $4.99 billion, respectively. The enormous d…]]></summary>

Why Bitcoin Falls Short As A Store Of Value Claim
 
In an exclusive interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Scaramucci declared that BTC fails to qualify as a store of value in the financial sector. His critique centers around the negative impact of the crypto industry’s current regulatory framework.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin traders might be upbeat about what lies ahead. However, looking at the daily chart, the world’s most valuable coin is struggling for momentum. BTC prices are inside a narrow range, with support at around $56,000 on the lower end and a stubborn liquidation level at $63,000.
 
Even though the uptrend remains, at least considering the state of price action in the past few trading days, conservative and risk-on traders are now on the sidelines. 
 
It is only when there is a clear trend definition, either below $50,000 or above $72,000, that traders can commit. The result will be an uptick in trading volume, currently muted and way below the averages recorded on August 8.
