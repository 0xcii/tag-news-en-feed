A dangerous trend has emerged in the United States that is seeing terms like “free speech,” “censorship resistant,” “privacy” and more become co-opted by those on the political right, while tools enabling these principles are argued and fought against by those on the political left. The truth is that freedom, privacy and censorship-resistant technologies are important for everyone, regardless of political leanings and they should not be politicized, lest we head down the path toward a dystopian future with no privacy or free speech guarantees, and only centralized institutions controlled by people with the ability to censor, revoke and remove important guarantees of freedom promoted in the spirit and language …]]></summary>

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/nodal-power-secures-13-million-seed-round-to-drive-renewable-energy-transformation-at-landfills"/>
        <updated>2023-08-21T13:00:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nodal Power, who mitigates methane at landfills by powering Bitcoin mining data centers, announced that the company has successfully raised $13 million in a seed funding round aimed at aggressively curbing methane emissions from landfills while harnessing their latent energy potential, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.
A significant portion of the funds has already been deployed for the construction and operation of two power plants within the United States. The first site, located in the southeast US, channels the electricity generated from landfill gas into the local utility grid. This site features data center, enabling the efficient distribution of energy between the utility and the data center. 
The second site, located in the mountain west region, boasts a pioneering off-grid Bitcoin mining data center, powered by landfill gas. Plans are in place to allocate additional funding for the development of a third site, slated for early 2024. All three sites share the common goal of harnessing renewable electricity from the methane gas generated during the decomposition of organic waste in landfills.
“We’ve developed solutions, specifically for smaller landfills, that allow us to bring these overlooked resources to market,” said Nodal Power CEO Bryan Black. “Our technology and energy first approach have the potential to make a significant impact on local energy markets.”
Nodal Power's initiative carries the potential to substantially reduce methane emissions originating from landfills. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is known to be 25 times more adept at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The company's approach involves combusting methane gas within generators, a strategy that not only mitigates methane but also cuts down on carbon emissions when compared to traditional flaring or venting practices. This process thereby transforms a previously wasted resource into a beneficial energy source.

Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Set Another All-Time High
 
As Bitcoin is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) network, chain validators called miners compete with each other using computing power to get a chance to hash the next block.
 
The “mining hashrate” is an indicator that measures the total amount of this computing power that the miners have currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
Generally, the higher the hashrate, the more secure is the network as a 51% hack becomes much harder to perform. This is, of course, given that the hashrate is also sufficiently decentralized.
 
The indicator carries more significance than just that though as it can provid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Australian securities regulator recently revealed that the crypto lending platform Helio pleaded guilty to the allegation of falsely claiming to be a holder of the Australian Credit License (ACL). For admitting to committing the offense, Helio is said to have entered a “recognisance” of $9,560 (AUD15,000) for 12 months which is contingent on the crypto lender’s good behavior.
 
Helio Said to Be in Breach of Australian Consumer Protection Law
 
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) announced on Aug. 17 that the Melbourne-based cryptocurrency lender Helio Lending has been sentenced for falsely claiming it held a credit license. According to the regulator, such a claim is in breach of section 30 of Australia’s National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009.
 
In a statement, the Aussie securities regulator revealed that the license claim was made in an article that appeared on Helio’s website in Aug. 2019. The regulator argued that Helio portrayed itself as a licensed entity when it knew full well that it was not a holder of the Australian Credit License (ACL).
 

 
Commenting on her organization’s punishment of Helio, ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said:
 

We expect entities and individuals to provide accurate information to their customers and potential customers. Helio falsely claimed that it held an Australian Credit Licence (ACL), misleading their customers to believe that they had the protections afforded by such a licence.
 
For admitting to committing the offense, Helio is said to have entered a “recognisance” of $9,560 (AUD15,000) for 12 months which is contingent on the crypto lender’s good behavior. However, the regulator said the second charge relating to the content seen on Helio’s website has since been withdrawn.

Ethereum Accounts For Most Crypto Seizures
 
Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, accounted for the most crypto seizures, the filing showed. The FBI seized $800,000 worth of Ether, as well as Bitcoin ($147,000), Tether’s USDT ($307,000), Monero ($20,000), DAI ($469,000), SOL ($959), BNB ($423), and DOGE ($200).

ago, many publicly traded companies significantly transformed their business to  
capitalize on the growing popularity of cryptocurrency mining. Now, as the  
profitability of these operations becomes decidedly smaller, they are looking

beginning to offer access to substantial computing power from their data

sector.
Miners Move from Bitcoin

According  
to the latest report by JPMorgan published last week, the largest mining

Analysts are now finding solace in a combination of technical indicators and historical trends, underpinning their optimism about Bitcoin’s potential for a rebound.
 
Prominent crypto analyst, known by the moniker TechDev on the X platform (formerly Twitter), has drawn attention to a promising narrative. 
 
Drawing parallels from previous market cycles, TechDev suggests that Bitcoin’s recent descent to the $25,000 level might function as a springboard for a renewed expansion upward. 
 
 
Past patterns have shown that such sharp declines can often precede periods of heightened growth, presenting an intriguing outlook for the king cryptocurrency.
