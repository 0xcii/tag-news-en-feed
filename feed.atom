        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Estonian government has once again approved the extradition of the two alleged masterminds behind the Hashflare crypto mining Ponzi scheme to the United States. According to a local news report, the government has met the conditions for the men’s extradition set by the Tallinn Circuit Court. 
 
The Estonian Ministry of Justice Has Collected Sufficient Evidence as Demanded by the Court
 
The Estonian government has approved the extradition of two founders of the crypto mining platform Hashflare, who are accused of operating a Ponzi scheme that fleeced $575 million from unsuspecting investors.
 
Ivan Turogin and Sergei Potapenko were arrested in Estonia’s capital Tallinn in November 2022, in a joint operation by the Estonian police and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). They face 18 counts of fraud and money laundering charges.
 
According to a Post Timees report, Tallinn Circuit Court initially blocked the attempt to extradite the duo because the Estonian government had failed to probe the conditions of the place where Turogin and Potapenko were to be held, among other things. However, the Estonian government through the Ministry of Justice has said it has gathered enough evidence as per the court ruling.
 
 
The Estonian government now believes it has satisfied the conditions set by the court, and the men’s extradition to the U.S. would be above board. Described as one of Estonia’s high-profile fraud cases, Turogin and Potapenko’s Ponzi scheme reportedly took money from hundreds of thousands of Estonian and non-Estonian investors who were promised high returns on their investments.
 
After their arrest, a U.S. attorney suggested that Turogin and Potapenko had used the allure of cryptocurrency mining to dupe people into investing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent consumer alert, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) warned about the proliferation of scams leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to lure unsuspecting individuals into fraudulent crypto investment schemes. 
 
Specifically, these scams exploit the growing interest in cryptocurrency arbitrage trading by making “audacious claims” of generating outsized profits through AI-powered algorithms.
 
AI-Driven Crypto Investment Scams Exposed
 
According to the CFTC’s press release, these actors peddle the notion that AI-created algorithms can deliver “astronomical returns”, often ranging in the tens of thousands of percent, or boast a 100 percent success rate. These claims encompass various algorithms, including automated trading bots and signal providers.

Alex Blania, CEO and co-founder of Tools For Humanity, the company behind Worldcoin, stated that the next iteration would be akin to an “Apple product.”
 
Worldcoin Redesigns the Orb to Be “Much More Friendly”
 
Worldcoin, the biometric ID and wallet project, is making changes to the Orb, a device used to scan the irises of users wishing to prove their personhood, to make it less polarizing. Alex Blania, CEO of Tools for Humanity, explained that the current design of the Orb was agreed upon before he arrived at the company almost four years ago.
 
Blania hopes to tone down the device with a programmed upgrade, making it more appealing and adding personalization options. In a chat, Blania told Techcrunch more about this redesign. He explained:
 

The new Orb is coming and the next iterations will look quite different.
 
Furthermore, Blania clarified that this new version of the Orb will be more friendly and appealing, similar to an Apple product. He also acknowledged that the current design was polarizing, with some people loving it and some hating it due to its sci-fi-like appearance.
 
While there was no announcement of the precise date of the reveal of this upgraded Orb, Blania stated that it would be launched in the first half of 2024 and that it had already been field-tested.
 
The Wordcoin project, launched officially in June, already has more than 3 million unique users in 120 countries, registering more than 190,000 signups just in the last week. In July, Sam Altman, co-founder of the Worldcoin project, declared that the project was accelerating, reporting that there was one signup every eight seconds.
