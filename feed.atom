        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meme coins were the rave for the last couple of months following PEPE’s success. But now that the hype has finally died down, it has given the room for investors to look at the meme coins that actually carry the most promise. These older meme coins have been in the market for a while and their communities are still very active. However, not all of them have held up well price-wise, so in this report, we take a look at the meme coin that has been the best performer even through the bear market.

While some jurisdictions have embraced cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to promote innovation and economic growth, others remain skeptical and have taken a more cautious approach to regulation.
 
Against this backdrop, according to a Bloomberg report, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has voiced its concerns about the global regulatory gaps in the market. 
 
The DFSA has warned that bad actors are “exploiting” these regulatory blind spots across the world and has called for greater coordination among regulators to prevent these activities, according to a recent Bloomberg report.…]]></summary>

A report compiled by DappRadar showed that Blur’s NFT loan volumes rose from 4,200 ETH (or roughly $7.6 million) to 169,900 ETH (or $308 million) in less than a month. All loans were processed through the Blur Lending protocol called Blend that was launched on May 1, 2023.
 
Further data reveals that NFT trading volumes have been shrinking as activity shifts to lending since early May. Trackers show that more NFT holders are creating accounts and taking loans backed with their assets.

Hogan clarified that this is not a prediction but rather a pattern that has emerged in the case, , it does suggest that the case’s outcome may be decided in the coming weeks.

The “exchange netflow” is an indicator that measures the net amount of Bitcoin that’s entering into or exiting the wallets of all centralized exchanges. Its value is naturally calculated as the inflows minus the outflows.
 
When the value of this metric is positive, it means a net amount of BTC is entering the wallets of these platforms right now. Since one of the main reasons why investors would deposit their coins to the exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can h…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-05-26T17:35:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin Core version 25.0 has been released, bringing new features, bug fixes and performance improvements to the software. Users can download the latest version from the official Bitcoin Core website or update their existing installations. The release notes outline the changes and provide instructions on how to upgrade.
One notable change is the allowance of transactions of non-witness size 65 bytes and above, which opens up new use cases and enhances protections against vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-12842. Another addition is the scanblocks RPC, which allows for fast wallet rescans by returning relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors.
In terms of RPC updates, all JSON-RPC methods now accept a new named parameter called "args" for passing positional parameter values conveniently. Additionally, the verifychain RPC will now return false if checks couldn't be completed at the desired depth and level, providing more accurate feedback.
The release also includes changes to the build system, updated settings and new features. For instance, the shutdownnotify option allows users to specify a command to execute before Bitcoin Core begins its shutdown sequence. In the wallet section, new options like minconf and maxconf have been added to various RPCs, providing greater control over UTXO confirmations.
Bitcoin Core 25.0 introduces several improvements and optimizations, enhancing the user experience and security of the software. As with any release, users are encouraged to report any bugs they encounter to the official GitHub issue tracker.
Bitcoin Core is widely supported and tested on major operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and Windows. However, it is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems. Users should ensure they are running a compatible operating system before upgrading to the latest version. In addition, users are encouraged to review the release notes for a detailed understanding of the improvements in this version if upgrading.]]></summary>
