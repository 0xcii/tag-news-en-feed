        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to German broker firm Bernstein, Bitcoin (BTC) mining has the potential to be an AI survival, consolidation, and diversification game.
 
This is coming after BTC mining stocks listed in the United States witnessed substantial growth this year, with their value more than doubling after enduring a downturn in the crypto market in 2022.
 
This remarkable resurgence has been attributed to two primary factors. The first factor is the robust performance of bitcoin prices, which is because of an enhanced investor sentiment resulting from the recent filing of exchange-traded-fund (ETF) applications by prominent institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity. These filings have instilled confidence in the market and contributed to the positive trajectory of bitcoin prices.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-sol-hits-fresh-4-week-high-on-friday-ada-snaps-losing-streak/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-07T15:39:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana was one of Friday’s biggest gainers, as the cryptocurrency rose by over 11% during today’s session. The move came as markets reacted to June’s nonfarm payrolls report, which came in at 209,000, below expectations of 229,000. On the other hand, cardano ended a three-day losing streak.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rallied for a second straight session on Friday, as the token rose above a ceiling at $20.00
 
SOL/USD hit an intraday peak at $21.22 earlier in today’s session, which came in response to the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.
 
As a result of the surge, solana hit its strongest point since June 5, when the price peaked at $22.06
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a resistance level of 65.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 68.30, which is its highest level since April 14.
 
The next visible point of resistance appears to be at the 70.00 level, and in the event it reaches this point, it is likely that SOL will hit $22.50.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) rebounded in today’s session, as the cryptocurrency snapped a three-day losing streak.
 
After falling to a low of $0.278 on Thursday, ADA/USD jumped to a high of $0.2874 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw cardano rebound from a one-week low, as bulls reentered the market close to a floor at $0.2875.
 
 
One of the catalysts of this rally was the 14-day RSI, which bounced on its own support point at the 43.00 zone.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 45.25, a point that is marginally below a ceiling at 46.00.
 
Earlier gains have somewhat eased as a result of this, with ADA now trading at $0.2842.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) has raised concerns about the exclusion of decentralized finance, or DeFi, from the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The AFME’s latest commentary points towards the necessity of creating an all-inclusive regulatory framework that covers both traditional financial services and DeFi.
 
AFME, a prominent entity in European financial markets, expressed apprehension about leaving decentralized activities out of regulatory purviews. They stressed that such exclusions could potentially instigate regulatory arbitrage and dilute the effectiveness of the regulatory frameworks set to emerge.

CZ Says Binance Is Not FTX
 
One rumor that has followed the number of problems that the crypto exchange has been subject to over the last month is that Binance could be facing bankruptcy. Given the fact that the FTX exchange collapsed following massive FUD on social media that triggered a bank run, there have been speculations that Binance could go the same way.

Finance, or DeFi, has emerged as one of the financial industry's most

While the

In a new tweet, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has looked into the current profitability of the BTC miners. Naturally, to estimate the profits that these chain validators might be making, the cost of production that they incur needs to be known first.
 
To find this cost, the analytics firm has used its “difficulty regression model.” According to Glassnode, the model “is an estimated all-in-sustaining cost of production for Bitcoin (for the average miner).”
 
As its name may already imply, the model is based on the “mining difficulty” metric. The difficulty is a feature on the BTC…]]></summary>

An “over-unity” power generator (similar to the concept of a perpetual-motion machine) is a hypothetical device that produces more energy than is required to run it. Although there is quite a bit of controversy in this field, the mainstream scientific consensus is that over-unity power generation is impossible, because it defies the first law of thermodynamics. 
According to this law, energy can undergo transformations from one form to another, but the total amount of energy within a closed system remains constant. This principle is derived from empirical observations and has been validated through numerous experiments and theoretical frameworks. 
In practical terms, this means that energy can neither…]]></summary>

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to a one-week low on Friday, ahead of the upcoming nonfarm payrolls report in the United States.
 
Payrolls are expected to come in at 225,000 for June, less than the 339,000 jobs added the month prior.
 
Many believe a strong number will almost certainly guarantee that the Federal Reserve will hike rates later this month.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 

 
BTC/USD dropped to a low at $29,777.28 earlier in the session, which is its lowest point since last Friday, when price fell to $29,417.
 
Today’s sell-off came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) plunged to a floor at the 55.00 mark.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has shifted course, and now looks to be downward facing.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also plunged in today’s session, dropping below the $1,900 mark for the first time since the end of June.
 
Following a high at $1,917.61 on Thursday, ETH/USD fell to an intraday low of $1,832.03 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the lowest point ETH has hit since June 30, when the price collided with a support point at $1,820.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
ETH has since rebounded from today’s earlier low, and is currently trading at $1,862.52, as bulls have seemingly bought the dip.
 
This comes as the RSI found a floor of its own at 47.00, and has gone on to reach a present point of 49.86.
 
The next visible resistance level looks as though it is at 53.00, and if it hits that point, it is likely ethereum will be near $1,890.
