This ruling comes after FTX's legal team filed a request for

of hedging crypto assets and generating returns from staking certain digital  
assets for the estates and creditors.
Judge John Dorsey presided over the court hearing, where he not only approved the motion but also overruled objections raised by two parties opposing the plan. This pivotal decision allows FTX to initiate the process of selling, staking, and hedging its substantial crypto holdings.
