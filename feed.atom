This time around, Kiyosaki paints an incredibly bullish narrative for the digital asset over the next few years.
 
Bitcoin Will Touch $500,000 In Two Years
 
In a recent tweet, Kiyosaki told his over 2.3 million followers on Twitter that he expects the price of Bitcoin to reach $500,000 in the next two years. The author highlights this during a time when the markets remain in an uncertain position due to not knowing what the Federal Reserve will do to curb inflation.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-matic-drops-by-10-atom-hits-2-week-low/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-13T16:51:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon fell by over 10% on Feb. 13, as a red wave swept through cryptocurrency markets during Monday’s session. Volatility was high ahead of Tuesday’s U.S. consumer price index release, and with the depegging of BUSD. Cosmos also traded lower to start the week, hitting a 14-day low.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) dropped by as much as 10% to start the week, as the global cryptocurrency market cap plunged on Monday.
 
Following a high of $1.29 on Sunday, MATIC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $1.16 earlier today.
 
Today’s move saw the token fall to its lowest level since February 1, when MATIC was trading at a bottom of $1.06 .
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, Monday’s sell-off occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell below support at 55.00
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 53.53, which is its weakest reading since January 8, when polygon was valued at $0.79.
 
Should momentum continue to decline, a floor at 50.00 could be where MATIC bulls find stability, as they begin to prepare for future rallies.
 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Cosmos (ATOM) was another notable mover on Monday, as it also dropped to a multi-week low.
 
ATOM/USD fell to a floor of $12.85 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at $13.94.
 
Monday’s drop in price sees ATOM trade at its weakest point since January 30, when the token bottomed out at $12.78.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s move comes following two breakouts, first the $13.00 mark, then a move below a long-term floor on the RSI.
 
This aforementioned point of support has been the 49.00 zone, which was broken earlier today, with the index now tracking at 46.32.
 
If momentum continues to move downward over the next few days, there is a strong likelihood that ATOM could be heading to a lower support at $12.50.

As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the volatility could increase for the coin in the near future. The “Coinbase premium index” is an indicator that measures the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase Pro (USD pair) and that listed on Binance (USDT pair).
 
Since Coinbase is an exchange that’s popularly used by investors based in the US (especially large institutions), the premium index can provide hints about how the current buying behavior of American investors differs from that of Binance’s userbase (which is more global-oriented).
