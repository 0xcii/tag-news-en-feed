Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Are Sitting On 78% Of The Total Supply
 
As pointed out by an analyst on Twitter, the divergence between the long-term holders and the short-term holders is at its greatest right now. The long-term holders (LTHs) and the short-term holders (STHs) are the two main holder groups that the entire Bitcoin market can be divided into.
 
The STHs include all investors that bought their coins within the last six months, while the LTHs include those who acquired their BTC earlier than this threshold amount.
 
Statistically, the longer investors hold onto their coin, the less likely they become to sell at any point. Thus, the LTHs generall…]]></summary>

This is an opinion editorial by Austin Herbert, a producer for “The Mark Moss Show.”

How do I know that Bitcoiners suck at orange pilling? Well… we are at .01% penetration. That's just one out of 10,000 people who have been convinced to become Bitcoiners.

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell lower on Friday, as market volatility rose ahead of the latest U.S. non-farm payrolls (NFP) report.
 
Following a high of $24,091.54 on Thursday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $23,390.38 earlier today.
 
Friday’s fall comes as BTC bulls were unable to sustain a breakout of a key resistance level at $24,000.

However, these gains might be for naught as Voyager recently moved 270 billion SHIB to several exchanges, namely Binance US, Kraken, and CoinBase.
 

 
Voyager is a centralized exchange that went bankrupt due to the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund that imploded back in June last year. 
 
Recently, the exchange was slapped with a lawsuit by none other than FTX, another failed exchange that crashed this November, which is trying to gain back nearly $445.6 million in loan repayments to pay back its own creditors.
