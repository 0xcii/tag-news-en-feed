Bitcoin Miner Reserves See Sharp Decline
 
Since the year began, Bitcoin miners have been leaning more toward selling to make ends meet for their operations. This is evident in the declines that have been recorded in their balances after what seemed like a long year of accumulation back in 2022.
 
 
As a result, the current Bitcoin miner balances are sitting at about 50% lower than they did at the start of the year, and it doesn’t seem like they’re done selling. This is because data from Cryp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cosmos fell to a key price floor on Friday, as bearish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. Volatility has been high most of the week, with today seeing the global market cap drop by 0.95% as of writing. Chainlink also slipped in today’s session.
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Cosmos (ATOM) dropped to a key support point on Friday, as bearish sentiment returned to the market.
 
Following a high of $10.92 on Thursday, ATOM/USD slipped to an intraday bottom of $10.50 earlier in the day.
 
The drop in price saw the token collide with its long-term floor, with bulls opting to buy the dip from that point.
 
 
At the time of writing, ATOM is trading at $10.61, which is still almost 3% lower than yesterday’s peak.
 
From the chart, it appears that the shift in momentum came after a failed breakout of a ceiling of 48.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
The index is now tracking at 40.72, which is marginally above an upcoming floor at the 40.00 mark.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
In addition to ATOM, chainlink (LINK) also fell on Friday, extending a recent decline in the process.
 
After a recent four-day bull run, LINK/USD edged lower in today’s session, dropping for a second straight day.
 
LINK/USD hit a bottom of $6.46 during the day, which comes after a high of $6.69 on Thursday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s slippage pushed LINK close to a support point of its own at $6.45.
 
The token has since rebounded, and is currently trading at the $6.51 level, which came as the RSI also hit a floor.
 
Price strength moved to the 40.00 zone earlier in the day, but has marginally risen as the day progressed.

Bitcoin’s Difficulty Rises to Uncharted Territory, Straining Miners
 
This year, Bitcoin once again broke a record as the network’s difficulty jumped by 3.22%, rising to an unprecedented height of 49.55 trillion. The network’s difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to find a hash value that meets the required criteria for a new block to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, BTC’s social dominance has seen an uplift recently. The “Bitcoin social dominance” is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total discussions involving the top 100 assets by market cap that mention BTC.
 
What this metric tells us is how the current interest in BTC among investors compares with that of the altcoins. Historically, high interest in altcoins (meaning that the social dominance of BTC is low) has been a sign of greed in the market.

He's also figuring out how to upend what it means to be a music fan. The band launched a Deathbats Club NFT collection in 2021. That is to say: They were early. The lead singer said it was timed to give fans a chance to get comfortable with Web3 technology ahead of the group's 2023 tour, when the NFT holders can use their Deathbats for early access to tickets.
