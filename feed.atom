        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Bitcoin developer by the name of Burak recently unveiled Ark, a Layer 2 protocol designed to enable fast and secure transactions. According to a post on the Bitcoin dev mailing list, Ark offers an alternative scaling approach that allows users to send and receive funds without liquidity constraints, making it easier for recipients to get paid without an onboarding setup. Unlike other Layer 2 solutions like Lightning, Ark does not require the opening and closing of channels, reducing the on-chain footprint significantly.

This inability to settle the loan has sparked concerns, as there were previous expectations of DCG potentially defaulting on the loan, which is now under the oversight of Genesis’ bankruptcy estate.
 
Gemini is now contemplating granting forbearance to the Digital Currency Group (DCG) following its failure to repay $630 million last week. Forbearance, in this context, refers to a temporary arrangement where the borrower can either reduce their mortgage payment or temporarily halt making payments altogether.

The US District Court for the Southern District of New York is yet to deliver a judgment on the matter, but a recent submission by the SEC’s staff has led to some interesting developments in the case.
 
 
Attorney’s Claim Could Be A Game-Changer For Ripple’s Future
 
Attorney John Deaton, representing XRP holders in the Ripple lawsuit, has highlighted a footnote in Ripple’s opposition and reply briefs submitted to the court. The footnote suggests that there are “reasonable grounds” to conclude that XRP does not satisfy all elements of the Howey Analysis and may not be considered a security under federal securities law.

When the value of this metric is high, it means the investors are moving a large number of coins around the network currently. Such a trend is generally a sign that traders are active in the market right now.
