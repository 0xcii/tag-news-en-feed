        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[American  
stock exchange operator, Nasdaq, has abandoned its plan to expand its digital  
asset services by introducing cryptocurrency custody services to institutional investors. year. The launch  
of the service was initially planned as the Wall Street giant’s first major crypto project. 
Nasdaq Drops Plan to Crypto Custody Services 
Earlier in  
March, Ira Auerbach, the Head of Nasdaq Digital Assets, disclosed that the  
marketplace operator had applied for a limited-purpose trust company  
charter from the New  
York financial services regulator. The exchange sought the  
license so as to float a digital asset custody service. 
However, during  
an earnings call held today  
(Wednesday), Adena Friedman, the exchange’s Chief  
Executive Officer, told  
investors the company had decided to  
suspend the plan “considering the shifting business and regulatory environment  
in the US.” 
According  
to CoinDesk, the Nasdaq CEO, however, noted the firm  
will continue to support the digital asset industry,  
including through efforts to  
secure approval for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the  
US Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Nasdaq, one  
of the biggest stock exchanges in the world, is a global financial services  
powerhouse. During the second quarter of 2023 ended June, the company generated $1.43 billion in revenue. 
In  
September last year, the  
exchange launched its digital asset services  
division, with plans to diversify into crypto custody solutions. However, the decision to shelve the plan is a major blow to institutional clients who in recent years started showing enthusiasm for the crypto industry.
Nasdaq’s decision comes at a  
time the SEC is waging a legal battle against Binance and Coinbase, the largest  
crypto exchanges in the United States, alleging that both platforms  
are operating without permission and engaging  
in the sale of 'unregistered' crypto asset securities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana ended a three-day losing streak on Wednesday, as the token moved back above the $26.00 mark. The decline came following Friday’s move above $32.00, which took the price to an eight-month high. XRP has also rebounded today, and looks to be heading for its recent high over $0.9400.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was one of Wednesday’s notable movers, as the token ended a three-day losing streak.
 
Following a low of $25.12 on Tuesday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $26.57 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move is the first time solana has trended higher since consolidating a recent eight-month high.
 
 
From the chart, today’s rebound seems to have occurred as a result of the relative strength index (RSI) bouncing from a floor at 66.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is at 69.40, with an upcoming resistance point of 71.00 a possible destination for bulls.
 
Should this ceiling be broken, there is a good chance that solana could head back towards $30.00.
 
 
XRP
 
Sentiment remained largely bullish in XRP, formerly ripple, as traders once again attempted to push prices above $0.8200.
 
XRP/USD jumped to a peak of $0.8155 earlier in today’s session, before slipping to a current point at $0.7999.
 
Since climbing to $0.9479 last week, volatility in the token has skyrocketed, with both new buyers, and profit takers, battling for positions.
 
 
Market uncertainty has marginally faded, as a result of the RSI breaking out of a ceiling at 73.00. It is now tracking at 75.07.
 
Despite the next visible point of resistance being at 89.00, price is already overbought, which could lead to a prolonged sell-off.
 
As of writing, XRP remains largely unchanged at the $0.8000 mark.

Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Started Moving Sideways Recently
 
The “mining hashrate” here is a measure of the total amount of computing power that the Bitcoin miners have connected to the network. This metric may also serve as an indication of how secure the blockchain is, as the probability of a 51% hack to be successful goes down as the number of mining rigs goes up.
 
When the hashrate’s value increase, it can mean that new miners are joining the blockchain and/or existing miners are connecting more machines right now. This trend could suggest that these chain validators are finding the chain attractive to mine currently.
