This significant legislative effort aims to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) directive requiring banks to include customer cryptocurrency assets on their balance sheets, potentially clearing a major hurdle for the institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets.
 
The CRA resolution targets the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, issued in March 2022. This controversial bulletin demanded that financial institutions reflect an equivalent liability on their balance sheets for each digital asset held. The digital a…]]></summary>

The High Court of Singapore has rejected a motion by the beleaguered crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Cheong Jun Yoong, founder of Web3 investment firm Defiance Capital.
 
Cheong, also known as Arthur Cheong, filed the suit in April 2023, asserting that Defiance Capital investors were the rightful beneficial owners of assets held in trust by 3AC. He argued that these funds should not be used to satisfy creditor claims against 3AC.
