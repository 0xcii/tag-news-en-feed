Data provided by K33 Research showed that over 260 new firms joined the US spot Bitcoin ETF space, skyrocketing the total number of professional firms holding these ETFs to 1,199 as of the end of June.
 
Retail Vs. Institutional Investors
 
Although institutional interest is high, retail investors own most Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional investors increased to 21% of total AUM in June from 18% in Q1. This development shows that ordinary investors control the market even as institutions gain ground.
