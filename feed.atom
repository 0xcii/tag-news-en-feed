        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), known for operating one of the largest US-based futures exchanges, is planning to offer spot Bitcoin trading to its clients, according to a report by the Financial Times.
CME Expansion in Crypto Markets
Although not officially confirmed or commented on by the exchange, the plans to offer Bitcoin trading came when demand for the cryptocurrency among Wall Street money managers was surging. If launched, it would not be CME’s first foray into cryptocurrencies. The Chicago-based exchange is already operating a cryptocurrency futures exchange, which offers standard and micro futures contracts of Bitcoin and Ether. CME even ranks at the top of Bitcoin futures exchanges in terms of open interest, surpassing Binance, which otherwise dominates the spot market.

cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has experienced significant growth over the past  
year and, after five years of operation, has surpassed 20 million users.  
However, its expansion is not as dynamic in some regions due to local  
regulatory challenges.
One such  
example is France, where the local financial commission, AMF, blacklisted Bybit  
two years ago. Now, the national regulator issued a new warning to retail  
investors about the exchange, reminding of its lack of authorization in this  
part of Europe.
AMF Reminds: Bybit is  
Blacklisted in France
Under  
French law, digital asset service providers (DASPs) must register with the AMF  
before offering services connected to digital assets, including operating a crypto

He allegedly swindled investors out of CAD 40 million (about USD 30 million) with his crypto and foreign exchange Ponzi investment scheme.
The Fall of “Crypto King”
The announcement yesterday (Wednesday) by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) detailed that, along with the 25-year-old Pleterski, the authorities also charged his associate, 27-year-old Colin Murphy, with fraud. The arrest and the charges came after a 16-month-long joint investigation by the OSC and the Durham Regional Police Service (DRPS).
