“Economics I think is sort of like accounting — you know, it doesn’t immediately have any morals. You could go into welfare economics, you try to think of some human values or you go into variations.” – John F. Nash Jr., The University of Scranton, November, 2011.
This quotation from John Forbes Nash Jr. is taken from a lecture Nash gave on “Ideal Money and the Motivations of Savings and Thrift”, some 61 years after the publication of his first game theory paper simply named “The Bargaining Problem” (1950).
“The Bargaining Problem” is significant because it is believed to be one of the first examples where an axiomati…]]></summary>

XRP and Solana 2024 Price Prediction
 
Prominent crypto influencer Ben Armstrong has recently published a new crypto price prediction for XRP, the native token of the Ripple network and Solana (SOL). Armstrong made his predictions live on his YouTube channel on December 31. 
 
 
According to the crypto influencer, the price of Solana is expected to skyrocket to $1,000 and XRP to reach $7 within the year. “I believe that XRP will hit $7 and Solana will hit $1000 in 2024. That is not the top, that is not their peak,” Armstrong stated.

Outdated Global Payment Systems
 
The current state of global payments is laden with challenges. Traditional systems, largely dependent on a decreasing number of correspondent banks, are slow and costly. They take around 2-5 days for final settlements, impose transaction fees that can reach up to $100, and suffer from error rates of 4-6%.
