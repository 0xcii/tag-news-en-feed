Ripple’s CEO Slams SEC Chair Gensler Over What’s a Security
 
The CEO of Ripple Labs, Brad Garlinghouse, has criticized the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, for dictating which crypto tokens are securities. Garlinghouse tweeted Thursday:

However, the cryptocurrency retracted and returned to trading within its range formed in the last week between $27,600 and $28,500. 
 
Despite this choppy price action, a recent blog post by Justin Bennett, trader and analyst of the crypto market suggests that BTC has established “strong” horizontal levels, which are favorable for both scalpers and investors who prefer this period of range or consolidation in the market.
 
 
Will These Horizontal Levels Hold A Potential Decline In BTC’s Price?
 
Bennett further mentions that Bitcoin trades above the $28,130 pivot point on an hourly and 4-hour closing basis. Any attempt to retest this level…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin (DOGE) came into the spotlight during the 2021 bull market after mounting an impressive rally fueled by billionaire Elon Musk posting about the coin on his Twitter account. However, the meme coin has since lost most of those gains as the bear market has raged on. With Dogecoin sitting about 90% below its May 2021 all-time high, the question is now whether DOGE will ever reach $0.7 again.
 
Can Dogecoin Reclaim $0.7?
 
Dogecoin is still holding steady as one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the space but a worrying fact about the cryptocurrency is that it has an unlimited supply. Unlike Bitcoin whose supply is capped at 21 million or Ethereum which has enabled a burn mechanism to keep supply down, there is nothing keeping the supply of the meme coin down.

The signatories believe that safety programs and regulations need to be strengthened, as they assert that AI labs are currently in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy” this technology. On Thursday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong disagreed with this approach, stating that people should not “let fear stop progress.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uncle Sam made off with more than $215 million this month as it began to liquidate portions of seized bitcoin.
The United States government has been selling bitcoin confiscated from the Silk Road case in 2013. 
According to a court filing, the government sold 9,861.1707894 Bitcoin on March 14, 2023, for a total of $215,738,154.98. After transaction fees, the net proceeds for the government were $215,522,416.83. The government also revealed that there are still around 41,490.72 bitcoin left to be sold, which they plan to sell in four more batches over the course of this year.
Previously, the government has auctioned bitcoin, opting instead to proceed with open market sales this time.
The Silk Road was a darknet marketplace that was used to sell drugs, amongst other services. Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road, was convicted in 2015 and sentenced to life in prison. Ulbricht now seeks clemency, as a double life sentence without parole for entirely non-violent charges illustrates the government’s desire to make an example of those who build platforms outside their jurisdiction. 
Bitcoin Magazine recently opened an art gallery in Nashville, Tennessee, which currently houses a life-size jail cell Ross Ulbricht exhibit, including art that Ulbricht made in prison, as well as writing from ulbricht.
