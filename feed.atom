In a new Quicktake post, a pseudonymous analyst revealed that the activity on the Ethereum network has been on a decline, with gas fees touching their lowest level in recent weeks. This comes despite the upcoming approval and launch of the Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund).
 
According to data from CryptoQuant, the ETH average gas fees (Gwei) have dropped to their lowest since May 2024. As shown in the chart below, the 7-day moving average, which represents the average ETH gas price, has been on a downward trend since the beginning of June.
