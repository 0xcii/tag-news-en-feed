A mining device capable of 200 terahash per second (TH/s) with electricity expenses at $0.07 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) is poised to net an estimated $14.12 over a full day at prevailing BTC rates.

Per the insights from hashrateindex.com, the seven-day average for Bitcoin’s hashrate has soared to 474 exahash per second (EH/s). In a scenario where each miner operates at 200 TH/s, the total would be equivalent to about 2.37 million such devices in operation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin bull Cathie Wood believes gold's time has come and gone.
The CEO of Ark Invest weighed in on the enduring debate between the traditional safe haven asset and digital currency during a recent Bloomberg UK podcast, Merryn Talks Money. 
In a hypothetical scenario where Wood had to choose between holding gold, a cash deposit account, or Bitcoin for a decade, she made her stance clear.
"It's a hedge against inflation and deflation. It's digital," she began, passionately advocating for Bitcoin. Wood acknowledged the time-tested appeal of gold but highlighted a crucial difference. "Gold already has its demand; it's happened," she explained. In contrast, she emphasized that Bitcoin remains a fresh and evolving asset, with institutions only beginning to scratch the surface of its potential.
Wood's perspective aligns with the prevailing sentiment among younger investors who increasingly favor Bitcoin over gold. She pointed out that Bitcoin's allure lies in its technological novelty and the rising enthusiasm from millennials and Gen Z, who see it as a more attractive store of value compared to the yellow metal.
Intriguingly, Wood made a notable observation regarding the role of both gold and Bitcoin as hedges against deflation. However, she noted that Bitcoin's recent performance suggests that it has been outshining its traditional counterpart.
In summary, Wood's sentiment reflects the evolving landscape of investments, with Bitcoin emerging as a powerful contender.

Major Asset Classes In The Cryptocurrency Sector Continue To See Inflows
 
As pointed out by analyst Ali in a post on X, a large amount of capital is flowing into the cryptocurrency market right now. The Glassnode indicator that the analyst has cited tracks the netflows going into the sector by measuring two things.
 
First, it finds out the 30-day net position change in the “realized cap” of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The realized cap here refers to a capitalization model that calculates the total valuation of an asset by assuming that the price at which each token was last moved on the chain is its true value.

The Hong Kong regulator said it also wants to create a framework that governs banks’ provision of virtual asset custody services.
 
Hong Kong’s ‘Very Clear’ Rules
 
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is working on expanding the scope of its supervision of virtual assets to include stablecoin issuing entities, Chen Haolian, Deputy Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has said. Speaking at the recently held Hong Kong Fintech Week, Haolian also revealed that HKMA and the region’s treasury will soon ask for the public and the banking industry’s input on this matter.
 
According to a local report, the Hong Kong regulator wants to create a framework to govern banks’ provision of virtual asset custody services. Such a framework will not only ensure that customer assets are protected but it will also supposedly cement Hong Kong’s emerging reputation as a region with “very clear” rules.
 
In his speech at the weeklong event, the deputy secretary claimed that many European companies are interested in establishing a presence in Hong Kong. Such a presence will be used as a launchpad for the respective companies’ entry into China’s mainland market.
 

 
Meanwhile, when discussing the likely impact of Web3 technology on the broader economy, Haolian argued that the technology can be the basis for solving problems in finance, education and business operations. The technology could also help improve efficiency and reduce costs, and according to Haolian, “we should seize and embrace the benefits and opportunities it brings.”
 
Concerning blockchain, the deputy director revealed that Hong Kong has been promoting the use of this technology in the insurance industry and trade finance for more than four years.
