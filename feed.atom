        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is seeking  
guidance from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on  
spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
FSS Chief's 2024 Plans: Spotlight on New York and Bitcoin  
ETFs
FSS chief Lee Bok-Hyun outlined plans for 2024, including  
visits to major financial markets like New York in the second quarter. The  
purpose is to discuss various aspects of South Korean financial markets,  
including spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Lee intends to meet with SEC Chair Gary Gensler later in the  
year to discuss digital assets and spot Bitcoin ETFs. He highlighted the  
significant impact of the SEC's recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on global  
financial policies.
The announcement follows the SEC's approval of 11 spot Bitcoin  
ETFs on January 10, marking a historic decision. Previously, the SEC had denied  
spot Bitcoin ETF  
applications due to concerns about market manipulation in the crypto market.

        <updated>2024-02-05T09:39:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent ruling by the Kenyan High Court in favor of the Nigerian fintech startup Flutterwave will see it finally get access to $3 million which has been frozen since July 2022. The judge slammed the Assets Recovery Agency for continuing to hold onto the funds even after it withdrew its suit against Flutterwave. 
 
Flutterwave’s Legal Battle Against Kenyan Anti-Graft Agency Ends
 
A Kenyan court has reportedly issued an order to unfreeze $3 million belonging to the Nigerian fintech startup Flutterwave and two associated companies. This ruling is expected to put an end to a protracted legal battle over the frozen funds, which persisted even after the anti-graft agency Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) withdrew its lawsuit against the startup.
 
As reported by Bitcoin.com News in July 2022, over 50 bank accounts containing funds linked to Flutterwave were frozen at the request of the Kenyan anti-corruption agency. The ARA sought the freeze order following an investigation that tied these bank accounts to “suspicious activities.” At the time, the cumulative balance across these accounts exceeded $60 million.
 
 
Flutterwave has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and in early 2023, the startup’s CEO reportedly went to Kenya to seek the funds’ release. However, about a month later, the first case against the startup was withdrawn which resulted in the release of more than $50 million. The ARA nevertheless continued to hold on to some of the remaining funds drawing the ire of the judge.
 
“Such a litigation facade or decoy is inappropriate, an abuse of the court process, and an attempt at squandering the scarce judicial time,” the Nairobi judge reportedly said.
 
According to the report, Flutterwave will now attempt to get a Kenyan payments and remittance license.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The drop in the price of Bitcoin at the beginning of the year led to a publicly listed  
miner, Argo Blockchain (NASDAQ: ARBK), reporting a reduction in cryptocurrency

Argo Reports Lowe Bitcoin

The company  
generated mining revenue of $5.3 million in January 2024, 19% less than the  
$6.6 million in December 2023. The decline in revenue correlated with the  
decrease in Bitcoin production.
Argo's CEO, Thomas Chippas, noted  
that the lower Bitcoin output reflects a retreat of transaction fees. “Our  
Bitcoin production decreased in January as transaction fees retreated from the  
temporary spike we saw in December.”
