        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cronos rose for a second consecutive session, as the token continued to move away from a recent three-month low. Volatility in the marketplace was high on Friday, after several days of price consolidation. Stellar also surged, moving to a three-day high.
 
Cronos (CRO)
 
Cronos (CRO) continued to move away from a recent three-month low on Friday, after rising for a second straight session.
 
After trading at a bottom of $0.05072 on Thursday, CRO/USD surged to a peak of $0.05291 earlier in the day.
 
This moves comes as cronos bulls managed to avoid a full breakout below a support point at $0.0495.
 
 
One reason for this was the stability of the support point of 34.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 49.60, with the next point of resistance around 52.00.
 
In the event that price strength climbs beyond this point, CRO will most likely be trading around $0.05500.
 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
Stellar (XLM) rose to a three-day high in today’s session, as bulls continued to target a key price ceiling.
 
XLM/USD hit a high of $0.1271 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at $0.122.
 
The move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average approaches an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
This is the closest that traders of stellar have come to taking price over a resistance zone of $0.1300 since Tuesday.
 
Today’s surge came as the 14-day RSI broke free of a ceiling at 49.00, moving to a current level of 51.08 in the process.
 
Despite this, earlier gains have marginally eased, with XLM now trading at $0.1253.

Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Has Been Going Up Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, exchanges have recently received significant BTC deposits. The “supply on exchanges” refers to the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When this metric’s value goes up, the investors are depositing a net number of coins to these platforms. Generally, one of the main reasons why holders would choose to transfer their coins to exchanges from their self-custodial wallets is for selling-related purposes.

The nation aims to capture a staggering 7% of the global Bitcoin hash rate by June 2025. This is not just a lofty goal; it’s backed by data presented by Bitcoin mining expert Jaran Mellerud in his latest report.
 
Oman, traditionally an oil-centric economy, is located on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. It shares borders with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Historically, Oman has been the 6th largest oil producer per capita globally. However, the winds of change are blowing, and Oman is shifting its focus to Bitcoin mining.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After price climbing above the $26,000 level earlier in the day, bitcoin bulls have retreated from earlier positions, sending prices lower in the process. The decline comes after price collided with a key resistance point. Ethereum has also slipped, after moving closer to $1,700.
 
Bitcoin
 
Volatility was back in cryptocurrency markets on Friday, as bitcoin (BTC) bulls pushed price above the $26,000 level.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $26,414.01 earlier in today’s session, however this was short lived, as price now sits at $25,795.12.
 
Today’s move was the highest BTC has hit since last Thursday, and came following a breakout of a ceiling at $26,400.

Looking at the chart, previous bulls seem to have immediately liquidated their positions after price moved beyond this point.
 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) also hit a resistance level of its own at 45.00, before retreating to a current reading at 39.18.
 
Overall, this drop shows that market sentiment remains bearish, despite the slight spark seen earlier in the day.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also edged higher during Friday’s session, with bulls pushing price closer to the $1,700 level.
 
After trading at a low of $1,617.80 on Thursday, ETH/USD rallied to an intraday high of $1,657.30 earlier in the day.
 
Similar to bitcoin above, gains have since faded, with the world’s second largest cryptocurrency now trading at $1,626.05.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
A failed move beyond a resistance zone of 40.00 seems to be one reason for the reversal, with the RSI now tracking at 37.41.
 
Should momentum continue to slip, a floor of 35.00 could provide a stable base, and if this fails, ETH could slip under $1,600.

The crypto exchange said it expects as many as 80,000 participants and has promised a reward of just over $64 for those completing the course. 
 
Improving the Public’s Knowledge and Understanding of Cryptocurrencies
 
An Australian cryptocurrency exchange, Swyftx, said it plans to financially reward users who participate and complete learning courses offered via its crypto education platform. Known as “Earn and Learn,” the platform, which was formally launched on Sept. 6, represents the crypto exchange’s attempt to improve the public’s knowledge and understanding of cryptocurrencies.
 
According to a recent report, Swyftx’s courses will cover different cryptocurrency scams and how users can identify them. Tom Matthews, who heads the crypto exchange’s corporate affairs, said the educational initiative also seeks to make users tough targets for scammers.
 

 
As recently reported by Bitcoin.com News, cybercriminals are thought to have stolen nearly $1 billion via scams, rug pulls and exploits in just the first eight months of 2023. Criminals are believed to have used the same modus operandi to steal close to $46 million in the month of August alone.
 
Therefore, in order to help users avoid falling for similar crypto scams or compromised projects, Swyftx said its educational courses will include a checklist for evaluating tokens and crypto projects.
 
For users who complete the course, Swyftx is promising a reward of just over $64 (AUD100) while those who complete the initial fundamental analysis course will receive $3.2 worth of BTC. The crypto exchange reportedly said it is expecting as many as 80,000 participants.
