The information comes to light following an audit conducted by BDO, a renowned auditing firm, as detailed in the official auditor's report.



The audited report provides a comprehensive analysis of Tether's financial standing, including more information on its Bitcoin holdings. Tether, known for its stablecoin USDT, has consistently played a massive role in the cryptocurrency market, facilitating transactions and maintaining a peg to the US Dollar.
"At Tether, we look forward to great 2024, with many new projects and products ready to come alive," said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. "I'm really excited by Tether's expansion. While Tether is mostly known for one product (USDT), the company is becoming an investor and infrastructure builder in many strategical sectors, spacing from AI to P2P telecommunications, from Bitcoin mining to renewable energy production."
The company also had a $2.85 billion profit for last quarter, of which about $1.85 billion came from gold and bitcoin holdings. For all of 2023, Tether achieved a profit of $6.2 billion.]]></summary>

We're talking a massive leap, over 140% in value – that's huge! It's not just about topping traditional rivals like gold; it's also about leaving other cryptocurrencies in the rearview mirror.

New York Community Bancorp Shares Suffer 45% One-Day Collapse
 
In March of 2023, Bitcoin made a huge move from its bottom range on the heels of a collapse in the banking system. Back then, Signature, Silicon Valley, and Silvergate each saw extensive bank failures. The shares of each bank sank ahead of the failures, tipping off the market that something was awry. Silvergate, in particular, was later acquired by New York Community Bancorp in the aftermath.
