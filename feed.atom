        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In hindsight, all it took for real institutional adoption of Bitcoin to take place was the introduction of a risk-minimized, easy-to-use product in the form of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). In January, the SEC approved nine new ETFs that provide exposure to Bitcoin through the spot market, a strict improvement over the futures-based ETFs that began trading back in 2021. In the first quarter of trading, both the size and number of institutional allocations to these ETFs have blown away consensus expectations. Blackrock’s ETF alone set a record for the shortest time an ETF has hit $10 billion in assets.
Beyond the eye-popping AUM figures these ETFs have drawn, this past Wednesday marked the deadline for institutions with over $100 million in assets to report their holdings to the SEC throug…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. attracted $1.8 billion in inflows last week, their 18th consecutive record day of demand. The surge comes as the successful Bitcoin ETFs continue maturing.
Trading volumes across Bitcoin ETFs also rose 55% week-over-week to $12.8 billion. The past week's haul was Bitcoin funds' largest since mid-March when Bitcoin hit nearly $74,000.
Significantly, the ETFs acquired around 25,700 BTC last week, almost equal to the entire new Bitcoin supply mined during that period. This absorption of new supply is tightening the market.
The wave of inflows this month has already surpassed May's total inflows. It follows the regulatory embrace of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.K., Australia and Thailand, while political winds are also shifting positively.
With total assets under management across Bitcoin ETFs now exceeding $70 billion, the funds continue legitimising Bitcoin as an institutional asset class. Their uninterrupted demand streak further cements Bitcoin's reputation.

The past week's activity shows investors increasingly treating Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty as interest rate cuts begin in Canada and Europe. 
This institutional embrace is why Bitcoin ETFs have quickly ballooned despite launching just months ago. If current momentum sustains, more and more institutional money seem poised to flood the Bitcoin market.]]></summary>

While this is the first time a state pension has bought shares of a Bitcoin ETF, it’s not the first bitcoin investment by a pension fund. In October 2021, the Houston Firefighters' Relief and Retirement Fund acquired an undisclosed amount of BTC through institutional bitcoin services provider NYDIG.
That was before spot ETFs were available. Now that a safer, easier alternative exists to buying bitcoin outright, it’s expected that many more large pension funds will follow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has unveiled a new regulatory framework for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The guidelines, issued ahead of the upcoming Virtual Asset User Protection Act taking effect on July 19th, 2024, aim to bring clarity and structure to the burgeoning NFT market while safeguarding investors and fostering responsible innovation.
 
 
Fungibility Takes Center Stage
 
The core of the FSC’s approach hinges on the concept of fungibility – an NFT’s ability to be exchanged for another identical NFT. NFTs that are mass-produced, divisible, and function primarily as a means of payment will be classified as virtual assets and subject to regulations similar to cryptocurrencies.
