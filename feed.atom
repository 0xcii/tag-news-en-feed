The latest market data shows that HNT fell by nearly 16% since last week, leading to a flip in investor sentiment. 
 
 
HNT’s market performance in the short term is largely due to a recent development in the Helium community concerning the upcoming Helium v3 network upgrade. With the recent community uproar, we might see HNT struggle to perform in the short term.

While the network was first known for hosting gaming dapps due partly to its high scalability and low fees, it has evolved over the years. Taking to X, the analyst argues that Tron plays a critical role in banking the unbanked and the underserved in developing economies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent discussion within the XRP community has reignited speculation surrounding the token’s future price trajectory. The catalyst for this discussion was a bold prediction made by Crypto Tank, a prominent crypto analyst. He suggested that XRP could reach a $100 price target if it captures 10% of the daily transaction volume handled by SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.
 
XRP’s Ambitious $100 Price Target: A Deep Dive
 
To provide context, SWIFT processed approximately $5 trillion in daily transactions as of June 2022. If XRP were to secure 10% of this volume, it would equate to handling roughly $500 billion in daily transactions. This significant increase in transaction volume could potentially drive a substantial rise in XRP’s price.
