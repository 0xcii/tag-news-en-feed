3 Major Crypto Legislations Are Up For Vote
 
The community is closely monitoring the Senate’s upcoming vote on the repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). Initially issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, SAB 121 requires financial institutions to list on their balance sheets the digital assets they hold in custody for clients.
 
This practice diverges from traditional custodial asset handling, which does not consider custodied assets as part of a company’s own balance sheet. Critics argue that this could unjustly inflate a ban…]]></summary>

The executive order, issued on Monday, mandates the immediate cessation of operations at the facility, which is situated just a mile from the F.E. Warren Air Force Base, a key site for the control of nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles, the report said.
 
 
High-Tech Espionage Risks Highlighted
 
The cryptomining facility, operated by MineOne Partners Limited and related MineOne entities registered in Delaware, was flagged as a potential security risk due to its proximity to sensitive military installations and a nearby Microsoft data center that supports the Pentagon.

Bitcoin was once such a frontier. The early days were rife with scams, “criminals” and underground markets. The underbelly of the internet embraced it first. It was an agora filled with foreign and obscure figures. It thrived as a counterculture, void of any rules and regulations. No government to protect you from yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alexey Pertsev, a developer for the Ethereum-based crypto mixer Tornado Cash, has been sentenced to 64 months in prison after a Dutch court found him guilty of money laundering charges on Tuesday.
The judge stated that the platform was "intended for criminals" and that Pertsev should have been suspicious of the criminal origins of transactions.
The closely-watched case marks a major blow to financial privacy advocates. Many critics argue that Pertsev is being unfairly targeted as the developer of an open-source platform. 
Further, they say he did not have control over how users chose to employ Tornado Cash to obscure transaction histories on the public blockchain.
Nonetheless, prosecutors successfully argued that Pertsev did too little to prevent the mixer from being utilized for money laundering. 
They rejected claims that his obligations were lessened due to the decentralized nature of the platform's operations.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
Experts predict it will have a chilling effect on development of open-source tools that enable anonymity on Bitcoin and other blockchains. They argue it sets a precedent for holding developers liable for the actions of anonymous users.
Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in 2022 over allegations it obscured funds stolen by North Korean state hackers. Pertsev was arrested days later, dealing a major blow to the embryonic crypto privacy sector.]]></summary>
