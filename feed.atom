ETHE Discount Rapidly Closing
 
To illustrate, the CEO pointed to the ETHE chart, whose discount has been steadily closing over the past few trading months. Ahluwalia observed a 4% gain on December 22, further reducing the discount.

However, on December 11, the token experienced a slight dip, hitting $0.975 per unit. Despite some improvement in its stability, the stablecoin has still not enforced its intended goal of a $1 peg.
 
GHO’s Struggle for Stability
 
Launched by Avara (formerly known as Aave), GHO has been a noteworthy example in the realm of dollar-pegged tokens. Since its inception in mid-July, the digital currency has consistently failed to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar, persistently falling short of this mark. Despite a low point of $0.917 on October 24, 2023, GHO saw an upswing towards the end of November, reaching $0.98 per coin.
