Launching with a reported market cap of $73 million according to SolScan, the coin’s legitimacy and provenance remain mired in mystery as the crypto community seeks clarity.
 
Real Or Fake? Trump Memecoin Sparks Frenzy
 
While DJT shares the initials of Donald Trump’s media company (NASDAQ: DJT), there is no official confirmation linking the former US President to the coin. The assertion originated from The Pirate Wires’ X account this Monday, where it was momentarily tagged with a “community note” identifying it as “fake news”—although, at the time of this report, that tag has since been removed from the tweet.
