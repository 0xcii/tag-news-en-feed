The leaked diary was published by the New York Times, shedding light on Ellison’s personal musings and her role as a key witness in Bankman-Fried’s upcoming trial. Ellison had previously pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the alleged fraud at FTX and agreed to cooperate, shortly after the exchange’s collapse.
 
 
The DOJ contends that Bankman-Fried’s intention behind this leak was to discredit Ellison and undermine her credibility as a witness, given her cooperation agreement with the prosecution.
