Investigators suspect a private key leak may be to blame, raising concerns about the security of the entire crypto ecosystem.
 
 
On July 3rd, Bittensor co-founder Ala Shaabana announced a network shutdown via a social media post. This drastic measure came after attackers siphoned off at least $8 million worth of TAO, Bittensor’s native token. The incident follows a similar theft just a month prior, where another wallet hemorrhage resulted in a loss of $11 million.

KuCoin, a prominent global cryptocurrency exchange, announced a new tax policy.  
Starting July 8, the cryptocurrency exchange will impose a 7.5% value-added tax (VAT) on transaction  
fees for users with Know Your Customer (KYC) information registered in Nigeria.
KuCoin Introduces VAT for Nigerian Users
In a post on X, KuCoin informed its Nigerian users  
that the new tax only applies to the fee charged per transaction and not the  
overall transaction amount. For instance, buying 1,000 USDT worth of Bitcoin  
incurs a fee of 1 USDT (0.1%), and the VAT on this fee would be 0.075 USDT,  
making the net transaction amount 998.925 USDT.

The court’s decision in the Binance case on June 28, 2024, ruled that the SEC had not adequately demonstrated that secondary market transactions of BNB tokens constituted securities transactions. This is particularly relevant for Ripple, as it draws a parallel to its own legal challenges.
