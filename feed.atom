The move aims to tap into the growing demand among Wall Street money managers seeking exposure to the crypto sector. 
 
The move marks a significant step for major Wall Street institutions to enter the digital asset space, following the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January.

As part of his analysis, the analyst predicted that Ethereum would likely kickstart the rally these crypto tokens are expected to record once the Altcoin season begins.

Marks remarked in an X (formerly Twitter) post that a new all-time high (ATH) for Ethereum could be of “major service in many Altcoin progressions.” The analyst made this statement while highlighting a bull flag that had formed on Ethereum’s chart. He claimed that a breakout from that flag could spark a massive rally for Ethereum, which would, in turn, positively affect other Altcoins.
