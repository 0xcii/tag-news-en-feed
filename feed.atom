        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) price declined by 2.7% in the past 24 hours as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) looks poised to initiate its widely anticipated rate-cut cycle this week.
 
Why Did Bitcoin Decline Ahead Of Rate Cuts?
 
Hovering around $60,000 throughout most of the weekend, BTC price experienced a slump of 2.7% ahead of the Fed’s expected rate cuts likely to begin this week. Interestingly, the price action exhibited by the largest cryptocurrency by market cap aligns with the prediction by former BitMEX exchange CEO, Arthur Hayes.
 
 
Assuming the Fed decides to initiate rate cuts this week, it will be the first in 4 years that interest rates will be slashed amid easing inflation to stimulate the economy. 
 
Data from Polymarkets indicates that bettors are giving it a 57% chance that the Fed cuts …]]></summary>

The former president said he is out of danger, and officials have held a man in custody.
 
 
Secret Service agents found an armed suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, hiding in bushes near the golf course. He was armed with an AK-style rifle and was 300 to 500 yards away from Trump. The agents opened fire at him, and he fled. Eventually, he was caught on the I-95 highway.

Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Seen A Steep Drop Recently
 
The “Mining Hashrate” is an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that the miners as a whole have connected to the Bitcoin network. The metric is measured in terms of hashes per second (H/s) or, more practically, in terahashes per second (TH/s).
 
As BTC runs on a consensus mechanism based on the Proof-of-Work (PoW), miners naturally connect this computing power in order to solve mathematical puzzles and compete against each other to get a chance to add the next block to the network.
 
 
The incentive for competing on the network in this way is that the miner who add…]]></summary>
