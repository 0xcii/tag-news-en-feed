        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-sol-rebounds-from-recent-losses-atom-5-higher-on-friday/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-20T17:08:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cosmos raced higher for a second straight session, after recently snapping a four-day losing streak. Friday’s move saw the token move closer to a key resistance level of $12.50. Solana also moved higher earlier in the day, as price bounced from a key support point. 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Cosmos (ATOM), was one of Friday’s notable gainers, as the token moved closer to a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $11.70 on Thursday, ATOM/USD raced to an intraday peak of $12.38 earlier today.
 
As a result of this move, cosmos moved towards a resistance point at the $12.50 level, which was last hit on Monday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also hovering near a ceiling of its own, at 66.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 65.85, which could lead to marginal consolidation, with earlier bulls opting to liquidate their positions.
 
However, should this aforementioned ceiling be broken, then it is likely that ATOM could move towards $13.00.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Like ATOM, solana (SOL) also edged higher, as the token continued to move away from a support point at $20.00.
 
SOL/USD rose to a high of $21.77 earlier in the session, and followed on from a low of $20.53 the day prior.
 
Today’s rally sees solana in a bullish attempt to regain market momentum, following recent declines in price.
 
 
As can be seen on the chart, the move took place despite the RSI remaining below its own ceiling at 68.00.
 
Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as traders seemed to be preparing for another reversal.
 
Currently solana is trading at $21.43, with longer-term bulls still likely targeting an exit at the $24.00 mark.

The latest Genesis bankruptcy filing raised even more concerns and conspiracy theories among crypto community members, with some believing all of the now-bankrupt crypto firms are somehow potentially connected. 
 
Though crypto lender Genesis Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing did not result in any significant move in the global crypto market, it’s beginning to create and encourage more skepticism and disbelief in the overall crypto industry as influencers and crypto analysts have started sharing thoughts and opinions related to the recent bankruptcy filing in the crypto industry.

The report titled “Retail Investor Beat” showed that cryptocurrencies happen to be the second most owned asset by women after fiat currency or cash.
 
Crypto undoubtedly had its worst year in 2022, with the overall global ownership increasing from just 36% to 39% in a quarter, despite that, the adoption of this particular asset class grew substantially among women.
 
 
The report shows that women’s ownership of digital assets rose from 29% in the third quarter of 2022 to 34% in the last quarter of 2022. This implies that somewhere, investing in cryptocurrencies has made more sense to women than investing in or possessing traditi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin crept back up to the $21,000 level on Friday, as volatility in the cryptocurrency market remained high. After falling by nearly 4% in Thursday’s session, the global market cap is up by 1.14% as of writing. This comes despite the news that crypto lender Genesis has recently filed for bankruptcy. Ethereum was also in the green, as it rebounded from Thursday’s lows.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) climbed higher on Friday, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency rebounded from Thursday’s losses.
 
The rally comes despite the news that crypto lender Genesis has filed for bankruptcy, following the likes of FTX.
 
BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $21,175.24 earlier in today’s session, which comes following a low of $20,689.88 on Thursday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s rebound in price came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved back above the 80.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is at the 80.40 level, with the next visible resistance level at the 88.00 zone.
 
Many expect that BTC could make another attempt to break out of a key resistance point at $21,400.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also rebounded during today’s session, with prices continuing to move away from a recent floor.
 
Following a low of $1,515.79 on Thursday, ETH/USD raced to a peak of $1,559.55 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s surge comes as ethereum continues to move away from a recent support point at the $1,500 level.
 
 
Similar to BTC, the move comes following a dead cat bounce on the RSI indicator, with price strength rebounding from a recent low.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at a level of 74.64, which is marginally higher than the aforementioned floor at 70.00.
 
ETH bulls will likely now be targeting a resistance level at the $1,600 level.
