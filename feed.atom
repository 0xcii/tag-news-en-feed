        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trial of the former CEO of defunct crypto exchange FTX Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has taken full shape with just less than a week before it commences. In preparation, the court has released the trial calendar, which shows how long the case is expected to last. 
 
A Close Look At The Calendar
 
According to the court document dated September 28, the trial is set to begin on October 4 and end on November 9. Although the first court session is set to occur on October 3, that day is solely set for Jury selection and not when the hearing will commence. 
 
Once that is done, Judge Kaplan, the judge in charge of SBF’s case, alongside the Jury, will begin hearing the Prosecution’s case against Sam Bankman-Fried on October 4. SBF’s lawyers are also expected to open their defense at some point.
