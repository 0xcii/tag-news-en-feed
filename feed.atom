        <updated>2022-12-11T21:07:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arbitrum-based lending platform Lodestar Finance was exploited on Dec. 10, 2022, according to a tweet from the project’s Twitter account on Saturday. Community reports detail that Lodestar lost roughly $6.9 million from the vulnerability. 
 
Lodestar Finance Loses $6.9 Million in an Exploit, TVL Drained, LODE Drops by 53%
 
Another decentralized finance (defi) platform, Lodestar Finance was hacked for $6.9 million in an exploit, a number of reports detail. “[The] protocol was exploited and deposits have been drained,” Lodestar’s official Twitter account said. “We have set all interest rates to 0 so that supply and borrow balances are not moving while we weigh recovery options.”
 
Lodestar says the hacker “manipulated the exchange rate of the plvGLP contract” and then “supplied plvGLP collateral to Lodestar and borrowed all available liquidity.” This allowed the exploiter to cash out “what they could.” However, a “collateralization ratio mechanism prevented them from fully cashing out the plvGLP,” the team noted on Saturday.
 
 
Via the team Discord channel, Lodestar team members explained that they had paused borrowing and liquidation activity. Data from defillama.com indicates that the total value locked (TVL) in Lodestar was drained from close to $7 million down to a mere $11.06. The project’s native cryptocurrency lodestar (LODE) has dropped 53% in value against the U.S. dollar in the last 24 hours.
 
LODE recently tapped an all-time high at $0.718 per unit, 18 days ago on Nov. 23, 2022. LODE’s value is now down 76.1% from that value and has seen a 24-hour price range of around $0.13 to $0.369 per unit. At press time, LODE is exchanging hands for $0.173 per coin.

Before its fall, the SBF-led crypto exchange got several operational approvals in many countries. Its expanded active regions accounted for its large customer base in the industry.
 
However, the sudden collapse of the exchanges led to the closedown of almost all its branches in many countries. However, the Japanese local regulatory authorities approved the FTX subsidiary in the country to continue some operations. In addition, they permitted the crypto exchange firm to tidy up its withdrawal issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uniswap was in the green to start the weekend, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly consolidating. The token rebounded from losses suffered on Friday, moving closer to a key resistance level in the process. Dogecoin, on the other hand, fell lower on Saturday as traders attempted to find a stable point of support.
 
Uniswap (UNI)
 
Uniswap (UNI) was one of Saturday’s notable movers, as prices rebounded from declines suffered the day prior.
 
After sinking to a bottom of $6.10 on Friday, UNI/USD marginally rebounded, climbing to a high of $6.27 in the process.
 
As a result of this, the token moved closer to a key resistance level of $6.35, which was last hit December 5.
 
 
In order to recapture this point, UNI bulls will first need to rise beyond a ceiling of 56.70 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Currently, the index is tracking at a level of 54.75, which has contributed to the current market volatility, with traders unsure if they should maintain previous positions.
 
However, should we see price strength surge beyond the aforementioned resistance at 56.70, then it is possible that UNI bulls could send prices towards the $7.00 mark.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) on the other hand remained in the red, following a failed breakout of a key resistance point on Friday.
 
Following a move to a high of $0.09858 yesterday, DOGE/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.096 on Saturday.
 
The move comes as the meme coin was unable to surge past its ceiling of $0.0990 during Friday’s session.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this point of resistance coincides with another ceiling — that of the RSI.
 
As of writing, the index is currently tracking at 51.96, which is marginally below a ceiling of 53.00.
 
Should we see this wall broken, it is likely that the meme coin could head back towards the $0.1000 region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the weekend trading above $17,000, as traders prepare for next week’s U.S. Federal Reserve interest decision. Markets now expect that the Fed could continue hiking rates, following a higher than expected increase in producer prices. Ethereum mainly consolidated on Saturday, as prices moved back towards a key price floor. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) remained above the $17,000 level to start the weekend, despite crypto markets mostly consolidating.
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $17,100.84 during Saturday’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $17,280.55.
 
As a result of today’s decline, BTC continued to move below its recent resistance level of $17,200.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it now appears as if bitcoin could be moving towards a floor of $16,750, which comes as market volatility remains high today.
 
The turbulence came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to move between a floor of 50.00 and a ceiling of 52.00.
 
In order for bulls to fully regain market sentiment, a breakout of the 52.00 mark must occur, which could then lead to the return of upwards momentum.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Like bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also consolidated to start the weekend, with price moving close to a key point of support.
 
Following a peak of $1,290.06 on Friday, ETH/USD moved to a bottom of $1,260.82 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s drop, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moved closer to a recent floor of $1,230.
 
 
From the chart, it seems that today’s consolidation comes as bulls failed to break out of a resistance point at $1,300.
 
As of writing, ethereum now seems as though it is heading for its aforementioned floor at the $1,230 point.
 
This comes as the 10-day (red) moving average now appears to have halted recent gains, and is slowly shifting downwards.
