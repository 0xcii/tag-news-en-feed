The reality is that all of them are wrong, in the sense that all of them are just a partial description of what Satoshi Nakamoto started. That second word, “is,” is where the problem is. Even though Bitcoin is all of them, if you say only one of them, you are limiting your understanding of it. The only true answer: Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

a large portion of a London lawsuit, valued at up to 10 billion pounds ($12.8  
billion), over allegations of collusion to "delist" the Bitcoin  
Satoshi Vision (BSV) cryptocurrency.
London Lawsuit Targets Binance and Kraken
The lawsuit, brought to London's Competition Appeal Tribunal  
(CAT) on behalf of over 200,000 BSV owners, targets Binance and other exchanges  
including Kraken. The suit, filed by BSV Claims, accuses the exchanges of  
anti-competitive behaviour in delisting BSV in 2019. 
The plaintiffs argue that  
this action caused the value of BSV to drop significantly and hindered its

Delving into the significance of this development, cryptocurrency analyst and trader YG Crypto has emphasized that Bitcoin must break above the level and maintain that break in order for the digital asset to regain its bullish momentum.
 
The $70,000 Price Mark Is Crucial For Bitcoin
 
The analyst’s findings underscore the possibility of large price swings if this barrier is overcome and sustained, which coincides with the resurgence of interest in BTC among institutional and individual investors.

Binance’s compliance issues with Nigerian authorities.
