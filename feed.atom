In the realm of high achievers, success is not a solo journey. It is a symphony, where the harmonious blend of motivation, mentorship, and like-minded individuals sets the stage for greatness. Have you ever wondered what separates millionaires, athletes, and thriving entrepreneurs from the rest? It is their secret: the power of a community that fuels their ascent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was a notable mover on Monday, as the meme coin fell by as much as 5% to start the week. Today’s decline comes as traders moved away from high-risk assets, in favor of safe-havens like gold. XRP also dropped in today’s session, hitting a three-week low in the process.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) fell to a multi-month low to start the week, as markets slipped due to growing tensions in the Middle East.
 
SHIB/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.000006894 on Monday, less than 24 hours after price peaked at $0.000007221.
 
Today’s decline saw the meme coin fall to its weakest point since June 16, which is the last time the cryptocurrency slipped below a floor at $0.00000690.
 
 
The relative strength index (RSI) also dropped below a support point of its own at the 37.00 mark.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 34.90, and appears to be moving towards the 30.00 region.
 
Should it drop below this point, SHIB will enter the oversold zone, which could then prompt bulls to potentially buy the dip.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was another notable mover on Monday, falling by over 4% in today’s session.
 
After reaching a high of $0.5218 on Sunday, XRP/USD plunged to a bottom at $0.4975 earlier in the day.
 
This resulted in the world’s fifth largest cryptocurrency moving to its weakest point since September 18.
 
 
Monday’s move occurred as the RSI retreated towards a support level at the 43.00 mark for the first time in three weeks.
 
As of writing, the index is now at a reading of 43.60, with ripple trading at $0.5014, following a three-day losing streak.
 
In the event that the RSI falls under 43.00, XRP will likely edge below $0.5000 in the upcoming days.

cryptocurrency has long been a source of interest and contention, with  
supporters applauding its potential for financial innovation and detractors

Recognizing  
the Fentanyl Crisis
Before getting  
into the potential links with cryptocurrencies, it's critical to understand the  
gravity of the fentanyl problem. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is far  
more potent than natural opioids such as heroin and morphine. Its widespread

Bitcoin Progress Towards Next Halving Has Now Hit 86%
 
In a post on X, the BTC cycle analyst Root posted an update on the halving progress of the cryptocurrency. The “halving” is a periodic event on the Bitcoin blockchain where the block rewards of the asset are cut exactly in half.
 
The “block rewards” here refer to the rewards that miners receive as compensation for solving blocks on the network. These rewards serve as the only way to mint new BTC, so the rate at which miners solve blocks can be thought of as the production rate of the asset.
 
 
The reason the halving exists is so that this production rate continues to go down over time. If…]]></summary>

Crude oil prices rallied from a six-week low, climbing by over 4% overnight. Bitcoin gave up recent gains, as traders fled to more traditional safe-haven assets.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) slipped for a second straight session on Monday, with traders retreating from high-risk assets, as tensions in the Middle East escalated.
 
Following a peak of $27,999.55 on Sunday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,445.89 earlier in the day.
 
Overall, bitcoin has been edging lower since Friday, after bulls failed to orchestrate a break out above a ceiling at $28,300.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Looking at the chart, it now appears that momentum has shifted bearish, with bitcoin heading for a support point at $27,000.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has also been on the decline, moving away from its resistance of 60.00, and is now tracking at 54.35
 
A target of 45.00 on the RSI will likely need to be hit, if bears are to push BTC below the $27,000 level in the coming days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) suffered heavy losses to start the week, with the price falling under the $1,600 zone.
 
ETH/USD moved to a bottom at $1,590.34 earlier in today’s session, which came a day after peaking at $1,638.90.
 
Overall, it appears that sellers are looking to push the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency to a floor at $1,560, before possibly taking profits.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Ethereum is now trading at a two-week low, with the RSI also hovering around its weakest point since late-September.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 41.65, after recently slipping below a point of support at the 43.00 level.
