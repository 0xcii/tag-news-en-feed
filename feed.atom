This comes after the highly anticipated Chang hard fork was completely, moving the Cardano blockchain to a new governance. This supposedly gives it superiority over its fiercest rival so far in the game, which happens to be Ethereum.
 
Cardano Solving The Major Problems
 
Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson attended the Token2049 Conference in Singapore, which hosts some of the brightest mind in crypto. In an interview with CoinTelegraph at the conference, the founder explained the benefits of Cardano over the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

While stock indices responded positively to China’s economic policies, the crypto market has yet to see a similar surge. However, QCP Capital believes the next phase of stimulus from China’s central bank could fuel bullish sentiment in risk assets, including crypto.
 
 
Potential For Crypto Market Upsurge
 
In a post uploaded earlier today on its Telegram channel, QCP Capital noted that the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is expected to roll out additional stimulus, which, combined with easing from other major central banks, could inject more liquidity into global markets.

China Injects Economic Stimulus, Will Bitcoin Benefit?
 
In an announcement on September 24, 2024, the Chinese central bank stated it had slashed the RRR by 50bps. The move bears semblance to a similar step taken by the US Federal Reserve on September 18, when it initiated interest rate cuts with 50bps. 
 
According to cryptocurrency analyst Jamie Coutts, reducing RRR by 50bps will add $113 billion of liquidity to the Chinese equity market. This fresh liquidity could effectively establish a “stock stabilization fund,” potentially lowering borrowing costs on approximately $5.3 trillion in mortgages.
