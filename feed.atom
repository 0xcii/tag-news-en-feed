This pullback represents a notable retracement from its recent peak of $115 on January 3, prompting market observers to closely analyze the factors influencing this correction.
 
Interestingly, while the price may have experienced a temporary dip, the fundamental indicators within the Solana ecosystem paint a contrasting picture of strength and growth.

The police also apprehended 14 other participants in the fraud scheme and recovered more than $7 million in both cash and virtual currencies.
 
Worthless Virtual Currencies
 
Taiwanese police recently arrested two executives of what has been described as one of the region’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, ACE Exchange. The arrests followed an investigation which concluded that the duo had helped trick 100 individuals into buying “worthless virtual currencies.”
 
According to a Liberty Times Net report, Lin Nan, one of the executives, used the promise of quick riches to lure unsuspecting people into investing. Lin Nan’s alleged accomplice, Pan Nan, reportedly listed the fake virtual currencies on ACE to boost their credibility. The duo was able to perpetrate the scam for three years before law enforcement agencies caught up.
 
 
In addition to arresting the duo, police also apprehended 14 individuals at 15 locations spread across Taipei, New Taipei, and Taichung. A raid on Lin Nan’s residence saw the police recover more than $3.6 million (111.52 million yuan) in cash and virtual currency worth just over $3.4 million. The Taiwanese police estimate the total value losses associated with Lin Nan and Pan Nan’s fraud scheme at over $36 million.
 
After their interrogations, Lin Nan, Pan Nan, and the 14 other individuals were taken into custody. They are set to be charged under the region’s Criminal Code, the Money Laundering Prevention Act, and the Banking Act.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the initial week of 2024, the digital currency solana experienced a sharp decline, shedding over 6% in value. This downturn has relegated the crypto asset to the fifth position in market rank, as it oscillates beneath the $100 threshold on Saturday, Jan. 6, 2024.
 
2024 Brings Chill to Solana’s Market Performance
 
After surging by over 700% in 2023, solana (SOL) has experienced a cool-off period. In the last week, SOL dipped slightly more than 6%, yet it still boasts a 46% increase against the U.S. dollar over the preceding month.
 
As of Jan. 6, 2024, SOL’s intraday value fluctuated between a high near $100 and a low of $92.23, trading at $96.75 per unit at 12:51 p.m. Eastern Time. Notably, SOL commands significant influence in South Korea’s market, trading at $99 on Upbit and $98.81 on Bithumb, surpassing the global average of $96 per unit as noted on aggregate market sites.
 

 
Tether (USDT) is SOL’s primary pair, constituting over 67% of all solana trades, followed by the U.S. dollar and Korean won, contributing 14% and 8% of SOL’s trade volume respectively, according to data from cryptocompare.com.
 
Behind them, BTC and the stablecoin FDUSD represent 3.35% and 2.68% of SOL’s trading activity. Currently, Solana ranks fifth in global trade volume, reaching $2.287 billion in the last 24 hours, though this figure has dipped over 30% from the previous day.
 
 
SOL’s market capitalization stands at $41.30 billion, accounting for 2.387% of the total $1.73 trillion crypto market value. Despite a commendable 621% rise over the past year, SOL is still trailing more than 63% below its peak of $259 per unit on Nov. 6, 2021.
 
As the crypto asset navigates the volatile market, its future trajectory remains uncertain, leaving investors to wonder if it will continue as a leading performer in 2024.

The survey’s findings demonstrate that financial advisors are generally skeptical of the commission’s decision to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).
 
There are several reasons for this lack of assurance. The SEC’s cautious and conservative past handling of cryptocurrency-related items is the first and most important factor.

Financial advisors appear pessimistic about the SEC’s approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF this year, based a survey conducted by Bitwise and VettaFi.
