        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu, the second largest meme coin, has been undergoing a sideways price movement in the past 30 days, with an emphasised decline in the past seven days. On-chain data indicates this decline might continue in the short term as selling pressure continues to increase.

Timmer’s reasoning is built on the concept of “fiscal dominance,” where the government moves to expand the money supply, threatening the purchasing power of the currency. He notes the inflation in the works, as confirmed by the historical M2 money supply/CPI relationship.
