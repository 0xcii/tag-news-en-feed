While the crypto market experiences a positive shift in sentiments due to Bitcoin’s recent rally, different altcoin narratives and unconfirmed rumors are seen to be pushed by rumor mongers and scammers who engage in these daily activities for selfish gains and attacks.
 
However, the Shib ecosystem continues to evolve in development and innovation within the meme crypto space, but the question remains, is there currently an official token for the Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain? Shytoshi Kusama has this to say.
