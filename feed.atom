        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to trade higher on Jan. 13, with prices racing above the $19,000 level, hitting a two-month peak in the process. The latest surge comes as traders continued to react to Wednesday’s U.S. inflation report, which dropped to 6.5%. Ethereum also rose today, hitting a fresh multi-month high.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a two-month high earlier in today’s session, as prices climbed above the $19,000 mark.
 
Following a low of $17,995.20 on Thursday, BTC/USD moved to a peak of $19,031.80 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed to its strongest point since November 8, when price was above $20,000.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose to a peak of 82.00, which was its highest mark in over a year.
 
In addition to this, the upwards trend on the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages continued to mature, thus extending bullish momentum.
 
Despite this, prices are now well beyond overbought, which could mean that bears are lurking and preparing for reentry.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Like BTC, ethereum (ETH) also significantly rose on Friday, with price moving above the $1,400 mark.
 
ETH/USD hit an intraday high of $1,432.28 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after trading at a bottom of $1,378.42.
 
As with bitcoin, this spike in price has pushed ethereum to its highest point since November 8, when it hit a high of $1,580.
 
 
From the chart, prices of ETH are now deep in overbought territory, with the RSI index tracking at a level of 75.54.
 
Earlier gains have already begun to slip, as previous bulls have begun taking profits in anticipation of a reversal in momentum.
 
As of writing, ETH/USD is trading at $1,410.60.

Even though the statements come a bit late – one prediction has already come true – there is one prediction in particular that is causing a stir. In a tweet, the lawyer deeply involved in the litigation wrote:
 

1) The Ripple case does not settle until AFTER we get a decision from Judge Torres; 
2) An exchange (maybe more than one) is sued for selling unregistered securities;  
3) Investigation into SBFraud meetings uncovers bad stuff;

However, David Schwartz, Ripple CTO, appears displeased about it. In a recent tweet, he claims the current holding rules for Flare tokens lack incentive. As a result, Schwartz enjoined the airdrop receivers to sell their Flare tokens quickly.
