An advisor to several Bitcoin and energy organizations, Cross’s post not only defended BTC but also exposed gaps in Greenpeace’s stance, prompting the post to make waves in the community.
 
Lyn Alden, a prominent figure in the macro world, commented, “I think this is the most politely brutal post I have ever read on this app. Like, every time I thought it might start to wrap up, the constructive savagery only grew.” Echoing Alden’s sentiments, Jamie Coutts of Bloomberg Intelligence labeled Cross’s post as a “supremely articulate take down.”

Cryptocurrency

The IRS  
considers cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to be property rather than cash.  
This classification has major ramifications for taxation. It is a taxable event

As had been done with Ellison and Wang, the first thing the prosecution did was to ascertain from the witness whether or not he had partaken in the crimes he was about to testify about. Singh admitted guilt relating to his involvement in fraud and campaign finance violations alongside SBF, Ellison, and Wang.
