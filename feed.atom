Disclaimer: BTC Inc. is the parent company of the Bitcoin Conference and Bitcoin Magazine.
Gamma.io, Xverse and Bitcoin Magazine are collaborating to launch an initiative aimed at highlighting the new medium of art, settling on the longest-running and most secure blockchain, Bitcoin. 
The three companies will be showcasing emerging visual artists at Bitcoin 2023's Ordinals Alley, which is the first-ever fine art gallery for Bitcoin inscriptions, presented at the world’s largest gathering of Bitcoiners. The conference is taking place in Miami Beach, May 18-20. The gallery's curation is being co-led by Dennis Koch, art gallery director for Bitcoin Magazine, and Hugo Pouchard, art curator and advisor for Gamma and Xverse.
“Ordinals protocol is a remarkable technology empowering artists and their works in the long run. The gallery will explore the evolving relationship between the art world, the medium, and the crypto community," said Pouchard.
In addition, the press release highlights the Artist Open Call, describing it as “an opportunity for rising artists to showcase their work to a global audience.” Six showcased artists will be selected by a curation committee consisting of members from Art Blocks, 6529, Bright Moments, The Medici Collection, and others, with experience in traditional art and auction houses.
Gamma Founder and CEO, Jamil Dhanani said that "Gamma's focus, from day one, has been to empower creators with simple and powerful tools to launch their works on Bitcoin. Together with Xverse, we're bringing even more visibility and exposure to emerging artists from web3, and those interested in Bitcoin for the first time."

The "Bitman" collective, a group advocating for the adoption of Bitcoin, illuminated the Eurotower and the European Central Bank (ECB) building with the Bitcoin logo and the words “study bitcoin,” on the evening of March 29. 
The goal was to encourage people to inform themselves about Bitcoin and its advantages compared to fiat money. A spokesperson said in a message to Bitcoin Magazine that many institutions, including the ECB, deliberately discredit Bitcoin and knowingly misinform citizens to strengthen their own position. In light of this, it is especially essential to do research using one’s own tools.



The collective believes that Bitcoin has many advantages and that it is vital for people to educate themselves about its benefits. It is a decentralized currency that provides financial freedom to users and can be sent to anyone, anywhere, in the world without any restrictions or intermediaries. 
 
         
         
         
         
    
According to a spokesperson, "We want to encourage people to form their own opinion about what we consider to be the best money in the world." The group hopes that illuminating the ECB building and the Eurotower will encourage people to explore Bitcoin's potential and its advantages over fiat money, citing “endthefud.org” as a source for information on Bitcoin that addresses common concerns.]]></summary>

BitGo, a leading provider of digital asset custody solutions, has introduced a new security solution for protecting Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions from accidental transfers, also enabling users to inscribe their own content onto the Bitcoin blockchain. 
Ordinals inscriptions allow people to inscribe text, images, and videos directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. However, given that they are still a relatively new technology for Bitcoin, most wallets cannot yet easily receive, send or store them, which puts potentially high-value inscriptions at risk of being accidentally transferred or sent to mining fees.
