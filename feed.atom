        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, March 5, the Appellate Court of Montenegro has overruled the decision of the High Court of Podgorica, which had approved the extradition of Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon to the United States for criminal prosecution. The decision, dated March 5, 2024, nullifies the prior approval dated February 20, 2024, and mandates a retrial at the first-degree court, throwing a wrench into the international legal proceedings against the crypto entrepreneur.
 
Do Kwon Avoids US Extradition For Now: Here’s Why
 
The Appellate Court’s ruling came after identifying “significant violations of the provisions of criminal procedure” in the initial extradition order. The court highlighted a lack of “clear and valid reasons for decisive facts regarding the order of arrival request letter,” casting…]]></summary>

Envisioning a decentralized world, where people could express themselves in a new and inventive way, Kusama drew parallels to the lasting impact of the dot-com legacy, a period during the late 1990s to 2000, where investors made large-scale investments into internet-based businesses in the hopes of making profits.

I know this piece will come across as annoying to some, especially because I have only been bullish on bitcoin with some gusto for the last couple of months (though I first pointed it out to my readers in December 2022), but as a newfound member of the church of bitcoin community, I’d be remiss if I didn’t try out my voice a bit.
I apologize in advance for opining on things that many members of planet bitcoin have talked about and debated ad nauseam for the last decade. But, one way or another, I have to get myself up to speed, and I do that best cathartically through writing. As a result, you, the rea…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin marked a historic milestone after its price  
surpassed $69,200 today (Tuesday), according to Coinbase's data. This surge followed  
a broader trend of heightened interest and investment in Bitcoin, driven  
notably by the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the  
United States.
Bitcoin's ascent to new heights is mostly due to the  
influx of investment from the latest wave of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds  
(ETFs) in the United States, Cointelegraph reported. These ETFs have emerged as  
a pivotal driver of the cryptocurrency's price appreciation.
The Impact of the ETFs
Despite its unprecedented surge to new all-time  
highs, Bitcoin remains susceptible to significant volatility, particularly in  
light of the upcoming halving event. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of Bitcoin has  
jumped 18% in the past week and 1% in the past 24 hours to trade at $67,242 at  
the time of this publication.
The impending halving, a key feature of Bitcoin's  
protocol that reduces block rewards by half approximately every four years,  
poses a challenge and uncertainties for investors navigating the cryptocurrency  
landscape.
As Bitcoin's price surges past its all-time high, institutional investors are seizing the opportunity to dive into the cryptocurrency market through ETFs, Finance Magnates reported. Last week, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF experienced a record-breaking inflow of $520 million, underlining the escalating frenzy surrounding Bitcoin.

TradFi Is In “For A Shock”: Analyst
 
Citing events in the Bitcoin Macro Index, the analyst contends that even with BTC breaking records as it climbs higher, it is not backed by “full fundamentals.” This outlook is because BTC prices remain below a crucial level on the index. If this level is broken, Woo warns, the traditional market will be in “for a shock.”
