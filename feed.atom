        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US senators believe that the President’s bodyguards could do more than just wield high-powered pistols and don sleek dark glasses. The lawmakers have presented a measure that would give the Secret Service the power to look into and prosecute crimes using digital assets in a bipartisan effort.
 
 
Aimed at curbing the growing menace of illicit money and crypto use by criminals, the Combating Money Laundering in Cybercrime Act of 2024 has been proposed.
 
Specifics Of The Proposed Law
 
Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) introduced the bill, which would grant the Secret Service greater investigative powers to look into crimes involving digital assets, such as financial institution fraud, structured transitions, and unlicensed money tra…]]></summary>

The edited segment was part of Ripple’s new podcast series titled “Exploring Ripple’s New Stablecoin Ripple USD (RLUSD)”, featuring CTO David Schwartz and Ripple President Monica Long discussing the upcoming launch of the stablecoin and various aspects of the XRP Ledger ecosystem.
