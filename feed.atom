        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that demand for Bitcoin from HODLers is currently outpacing miner issuance for the first time in history and by quite a lot.
 
Bitcoin Demand From Accumulation Addresses Is Higher Than Miner Issuance
 
As CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno explained in a new post on X, the demand for the asset has recently been growing at an unprecedented rate. Below is the chart shared by the analyst showing the demand from the “permanent holders.”
 

 
 
The “permanent holders” here refer to the owners of the “accumulation addresses,” which are defined as wallets that have only a history of buying BTC and never of selling it.
 
 
Since these investors aren’t known to sell, it’s possible that the new supply that they accumulate would also become similarly illiquid in the future.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a CNBC report, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuers have expressed skepticism that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve similar spot Ethereum ETFs. 
 
Market participants, including asset managers BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, eagerly await approval for Ethereum ETF products, but some issuers are uncertain about the SEC’s green light.
 
Uncertainty Looms For Ethereum ETFs
 
The report notes that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s emphasis on crypto assets subject to federal securities laws has further complicated matters for an Ethereum ETF. Gensler has asserted that most crypto assets are investment contracts, consistent with the SEC’s perspective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent consumer survey by Deutsche Bank revealed a split sentiment regarding the future trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. While grim, this outlook comes when Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride.
 
The asset has recently achieved a new all-time high and declined significantly following that, but it has rebounded by nearly 10% in the past week.
 
 
Bitcoin Survey Sends Shivers
 
Respondents noted a notable level of pessimism about the cryptocurrency, with some predicting a potential drop below $20,000.
 
This unexpected sentiment suggests uncertainty in the market, particularly after BTC reached record highs in mid-March.
 
The survey, which polled over 3,600 participants, highlighted a divergence of opinions. Approximately one-third anticipate BTC’s value plummeting to levels last seen …]]></summary>

However, is it advisable to sell your Dogecoin holdings at this level?

The Dogecoin price, while it rallied in the past month, is far from achieving the expectations for the coin. A number of factors plays into driving a rise in the DOGE price and none of that have happened so far, leaving room for speculation that the meme coin has yet to begin its bull market movements.

XRP, being one of the largest crypto assets by market cap, has been included in this increase. Although modest compared to its counterparts, XRP pushed to $0.6257 in the past 24 hours, representing a 5.88% price increase.  
 
According to popular XRP analysts, the recent move looks like the start of an extended bullish action for the cryptocurrency. Particularly, analyst EGRAG crypto has identified a three-camel hump pattern that could launch XRP to a target zone around $1 to $1.3.
