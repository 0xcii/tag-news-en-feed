        <updated>2024-07-08T13:25:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The German government continued shifting portions of its massive Bitcoin trove to exchanges on Monday, transferring over $56 million worth across multiple transactions.
According to blockchain data, addresses linked to the German government moved a total of 500 BTC to Bitstamp and Coinbase (250 BTC each), worth about $27.9 million, at 14:48 UTC+8 today, and transferred 500 BTC to an unmarked address.

JUST IN: 🇩🇪 German Government sends another 1,000 #Bitcoin worth $56 million to exchanges 👀 pic.twitter.com/zsxg3q2tkV
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 8, 2024
  
  
  
Germany originally seized nearly 50,000 Bitcoin back in 2013 from the operators of the now-defunct piracy website Movie2K. The stash is estimated to be worth around $2.3 billion at today's prices.
This comes after the government shifted around $390 million in Bitcoin to various platforms since mid-June.
The steady flow of transfers to exchanges signals Germany's potential intentions to liquidate parts of its reserves. While reasons remain uncertain, the sales have fueled volatility in Bitcoin's price, which dipped below $55,000 last week.
However, the amounts shifted so far equate to a relatively small portion of Germany's massive holdings. After the latest transactions, the government still possesses around 40,000 bitcoins valued at nearly $2.2 billion.
Nonetheless, the remaining reserves represent a significant share of daily Bitcoin trading volumes. As such, experts caution the threat of further turbulence lingers as long as Germany stays active in reducing exposure.
The liquidations come just as long-awaited creditor payouts from Mt. Gox's 2014 collapse appear set to begin. This timing might compound selling pressure on Bitcoin amid an already bearish macro environment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metaplanet, a Japanese public company that started as a hotel operator, announced it purchased another ¥400 million ($2.5 million) in Bitcoin. This continues the firm's strategy of adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.

JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japanese public company Metaplanet buys another ¥400 million worth of #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/mT4cPKEcSP
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 8, 2024
  
  
  
Despite the slumping Bitcoin market, Metaplanet revealed it acquired 42.466 more Bitcoin on July 8th. This brings its total holdings to around 203 Bitcoin purchased for ¥2.05 billion ($12.7 million) — an average price of ¥10 million ($62,000) per coin.
Metaplanet is mimicking MicroStrategy, the U.S. software firm's Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has amassed over 200,000 Bitcoin, now worth $15 billion, making it the largest corporate holder.
Its stock price has often mirrored Bitcoin's fluctuations, with investors using it as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure. 
The Japanese company said buying Bitcoin helps minimize exposure to the weakening yen amid prolonged low interest rates. This approach also provides domestic investors Bitcoin access through a public firm with preferable tax treatment.
The yen has tumbled dramatically in 2022, dropping to lows against the dollar and euro not seen in decades. The Bank of Japan has maintained a loose monetary policy in contrast to global tightening.
While amounts remain small so far, its continued purchases show commitment even amid market turmoil. As "Asia's MicroStrategy," Metaplanet is positioning itself to ride future waves in Bitcoin adoption.

Although there were signs of recovery over the weekend, the value tumbled this morning (Monday) as the Asian markets opened. What is the cause of this dip?

A Bloody Week
Bitcoin peaked at almost $74,000 earlier this year, boosted by the approval of the long-awaited spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. However, due to periodic volatility, the cryptocurrency is trading around $57,500, down by around 23 percent.
