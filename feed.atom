        <updated>2023-02-01T17:01:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin raced to a nine-month high on Feb. 1, following a breakout of a key resistance level. The surge in price comes as the global cryptocurrency market cap rose marginally higher today, and is up by 0.57% as of writing. Cosmos was another notable mover, with prices up for a second straight session.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) surged to a nine-month high on Wednesday, as prices rose past a key resistance level.
 
LTC/USD hit a peak of $97.73 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $93.05.
 
As a result of the surge, litecoin rose to its strongest point since May 5, when prices were at a high of $106.86.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move took place following a breakout of a ceiling at $95.50, and came as the relative strength index (RSI) collided with a resistance of its own.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 65.96, which is marginally below a resistance level at 66.00.
 
Since approaching this point, earlier gains have somewhat declined, with LTC now trading at $95.58.
 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Cosmos (ATOM) was another notable mover in today’s session, with the token climbing for a second straight day.
 
Following a low of $13.15 on Tuesday, ATOM/USD moved to a peak of $13.84 earlier in the day.
 
Wednesday’s rally saw cosmos move above a ceiling at $13.50, nearing its highest point since November 8 in the process.
 
 
Whilst this resistance level was broken, the 14-day RSI was approaching one of its own at 66.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 61.77, after it bounced from a support point at 58.00
 
Should this ceiling at 66.00 be hit, it is likely that ATOM could be trading above the $14.00 mark.

Dogecoin Whale Transactions And Active Addresses Have Surged Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, a couple of DOGE on-chain metrics are at two-month highs right now. The relevant indicators here are the whale transaction count and the daily active addresses.
 
The “whale transaction count” measures the total number of Dogecoin transfers taking place on the blockchain that is worth at least $100,000 in value. When the value of this metric is high, it means whales are actively trading the asset right now.

Bitcoin Spot Trading Volumes Have Stabilized Above $10 Billion
 
As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, usually, the volumes drop when the BTC price starts to range. The “daily trading volume” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin being transacted on the Bitwise 10 exchanges on any given day.
 
Even though the metric only accounts for the Bitwise 10 exchanges, the indicator can still be used as a decent approximation for the trend in the entire spot market. These platforms also provide the most reliable data in the sector, so the picture painted by them is more accurate than just assessing the entire market’s data.

The attorney managed to elicit from the SEC, “live and on tape,” that it does not consider secondary sales of the LBC token as securities. In addition, the New Hampshire District Court judge confirmed that he would clarify in the final remedy that he does not rule on the secondary market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum was marginally higher on Feb. 1, as markets prepare for the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting results. Many are expecting that the U.S. Federal Reserve will increase rates by 25 basis points, taking current rates to 4.75%. Bitcoin was in the green on Wednesday, as prices rose above $23,000.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was back above $23,000 in today’s session, as traders turned their attention to this afternoon’s FOMC meeting.
 
After recording a low of $22,874.43 on Tuesday, BTC/USD moved to an intraday high of $23,225.02 earlier today.
 
Today’s move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency briefly move past an interim ceiling at the $23,200 level.
 
 
However, with volatility today higher due to the Fed meeting, prices have since moved back below this point and are currently trading at $23,045.02.
 
This took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to hover close to a floor at 68.00
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 69.83, and could remain around this mark until after the Fed meeting concludes.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rose marginally higher on Wednesday, with prices moving closer to the $1,600 zone.
 
ETH/USD rose to a peak of $1,598.52 earlier in the day, which comes following a move to a bottom at $1,569.04 the day prior.
 
Like with bitcoin, ETH bulls were unable to push prices above resistance, with earlier momentum easing as of writing.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the shift in sentiment has come as the RSI was unable to move past its own ceiling at 58.00
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 57.64, with the 10-day (red) moving average also changing its trend, and now downward facing.
 
Should this sentiment continue, it is highly likely that ETH will fall to a floor at $1,550.
