        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fees collected in a single block of Bitcoin transactions have surpassed the block reward, a testament to the growing demand for block space as a result of Ordinals and BRC-20. Given that this is the first time this has happened without the price of bitcoin being in a significant bull market, it is a milestone in the evolution of Bitcoin, as it reinforces the growing potential for transaction fees to sustain the network's operations.
According to Dustin Trammell, CEO of Trammell Venture Partners, the first time that the fees in a block surpassed the block reward was in block 500,521 in 2017. 
The rise in transaction fees can be attributed to the introduction of Ordinals and BRC-20. Inscriptions, sets of data inscribed utilizing the Ordinals protocol, already pumped up the fee market and…]]></summary>

In a recent tweet, Armstrong commended the UAE for being the first country to have a dedicated crypto regulator, publishing a clear rule book, and creating a business-friendly environment with strong customer protections.
 
Armstrong’s comments come amid the ongoing crypto crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and speculations that Coinbase may be eyeing a move to the Middle East. 
 
The UAE has attracted many crypto companies with favorable regulations and a business-friendly environment. In February, the Central Bank of the UAE announced plans to launch a digital currency, which could further boost the country’s crypto industry.

to Estonia’s anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financial of  
terrorism (CFT) regulation has  
resulted in a dramatic drop in the number of licensed cryptocurrency service  
providers. As of May 1, 2023, there were only 100 crypto firms with operating

is an 80% drop from 489 as of March 15, 2022, when the amended Money

According to the Estonia  
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a total of 389 operating licenses have been withdrawn  
either voluntarily or based on its action. Of this number, nearly 200 were  
withdrawn by the companies while about the same number were revoked by the

Check out this DXY versus BTCUSD comparison you cannot afford to miss and see why it could signal the official end of crypto winter.
 
Bitcoin Price Consolidates Below Resistance
 
Bitcoin price is currently trading at just below $28,000. Despite a lack of continued momentum at resistance, there has also been a distinct lack of a rejection.
 
In a market as volatile as crypto, prices rarely linger in a tight range very long. And when they do, the release in volatility is always worth the wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp plunged to a six-week low on Monday, as cryptocurrency markets moved further into the red. The global crypto market cap fell by over 3% to start the week, which comes days ahead of the upcoming U.S. inflation report. Solana also declined, hitting a multi-week low.
 
XRP
 

 
Xrp, formerly known as ripple, fell by as much as 5% on Monday, with the global market cap slipping by over 3% in the day.
 

 
XRP/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.4333 to start the week, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $0.4606.
 

 
As a result of this decline, XRP moved to its lowest point since March 25, breaking out of a floor at $0.4360 in the process.
 

 

 

 
Looking at the chart, the slippage came as the relative strength index (RSI), broke out of a floor at 39.00.
 

 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 36.04, with XRP at a level of $0.4365.
 

 
Overall, the token is down 5.11% as of writing.
 

 

 
Solana (SOL)
 

 
Solana (SOL) remained in the red, as the token extended its own recent declines to a third session.
 

 
Following a high of $22.74 on Sunday, SOL/USD fell to a low of $21.01 earlier in the day.
 

 
Monday’s drop in price has sent SOL to its long-term support point at $21.00, resulting in its lowest level since April 26.
 

 

 

 
The token has rebounded from earlier lows, as the RSI found a floor of its own at the 44.00 mark.
 

 
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 44.57, with a ceiling at 49.00 a potential target for bulls.
 

 
If momentum does rise, and more bulls reenter the market, that could lead to SOL climbing back above $22.00.
