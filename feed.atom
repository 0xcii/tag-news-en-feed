        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-dot-drops-to-6-week-low-on-tuesday/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-02T15:45:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polkadot was one of Tuesday’s biggest movers, as the token dropped to a six-week low in today’s session. Prices fell for a long-term support point of $5.60, as the global crypto market cap was once again 1% lower today. Avalanche also hit a price floor on Tuesday.
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) was down for a second straight session on Tuesday, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remained bearish.
 
DOT/USD dropped to a low of $5.61 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $5.82.
 
As a result of the move, polkadot slipped to its weakest point since March 12, when price was trading at $5.47.
 
 
Today’s decline saw DOT near a floor at $5.60, with bulls so far rejecting a breakout below this point.
 
At the time of writing, the token is trading at $5.68, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped from a floor of its own.
 
The index rebounded from a floor at 36.00, and as of writing, is tracking at 37.52.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
In addition to DOT, Avalanche (AVAX) was another notable mover on Tuesday, as the token fell to its own level of support.
 
Following a high of $17.06 to start the week, AVAX/USD sunk to a bottom at $16.53 earlier today.
 
Tuesday’s decline saw bears attempt to take avalanche to a long-term price floor at $16.30, however they were unsuccessful, thus far.
 
 
Looking at the chart, and similar to what occurred with DOT, the breakout was rejected as the RSI remained above a floor of 41.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 41.27, with a ceiling of 43.00 a possible target for bulls looking to extend the current rebound.
 
Should this occur, there is a chance that AVAX could reach $17.00

industry has been shaken up by blockchain technology, which has also changed  
how money is transacted. In this article, we'll talk about the advantages,  
difficulties, and potential uses of blockchain technology in financial  
transactions.
How does  
blockchain technology work?
Blockchain  
technology is fundamentally a decentralized digital ledger that securely and  
openly records transactions on numerous machines. Every transaction is  
documented in a block, which is subsequently added to the chain of blocks  
(thus, "blockchain"), one block for each transaction.
It is  
impossible to change or remove a block once it has been added to the chain,  
making it a safe and impenetrable record of all transactions.

He expressed his belief that a sell-off could be imminent, and that this could occur as a result of U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell’s upcoming remarks on Wednesday. Furthermore, there has been a great deal of conjecture surrounding the possibility of the central bank cutting the federal funds rate multiple times throughout the year. However, Wilson believes that investors who are expecting this outcome will ultimately be disappointed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below the $28,000 level on Tuesday, as markets continued to prepare for tomorrow’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision. The Fed is expected to increase rates by 0.25%, despite the U.S. economy slowing down. Ethereum also remained lower, moving close to a breakout below $1,800. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $28,000 on Tuesday, as markets prepared for the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision.
 
BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $27,680.79 earlier in today’s session, which came less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $28,626.28.
 
As a result of this move, bitcoin nearly collided with its recent price floor at $27,600, hitting a six-day low in the process.
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
Looking at the chart, the latest decline comes as the relative strength index (RSI) moved below a floor of its own at 50.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 46.17, with the next visible point of support at 43.00.
 
Bitcoin has since moved back above $28,000, and is currently trading at $28,176.91.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also lower in today’s session, with prices also falling to a key level of support.
 
Following a high of $1,851.19 to start the week, ETH/USD plunged to a bottom at $1,809.19 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s drop saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency move below its long-term price floor at $1,830.
 
 
 
 
 

ETH has since rebounded from this floor, as sentiment remained relatively stable, despite the earlier decline.
 
 
 
This happened despite the RSI trading under a support point of its own at 45.00, with a current reading of 44.30.
 
There could be more moves on Wednesday following the Fed decision, with a potential move above $1,900 still on the cards.

CoinJar has been in business since 2013 when Bitcoin was relatively unknown to many. The platform has demonstrated high resilience, surviving several ups and downs in the crypto ecosystem.

Now Marco Santori, the company's chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
