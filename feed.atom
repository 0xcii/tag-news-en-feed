The approval sets the stage for a significant overhaul following the tumultuous financial whirlwind that ensnared the firm. 
 
The Long Road to Reorganization
 
After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 13, 2022, for most debtors, and on December 7, 2022, for the GK8 debtors, Celsius has maintained its business decisions under the court’s supervision. Two months ago, Alex Mashinsky, the ex-CEO of Celsius Network, submitted a request for the dismissal of the lawsuit brought against him by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Crypto Analyst’s Prediction For XRP
 
Cryptoary took to his official X (formerly Twitter) handle to share his recent prediction on the price movement of XRP. The X post was accompanied by a short video clip to further elaborate on his prospects.
 
The crypto analyst’s prediction was fueled by the recent price decline of XRP from its highest point of $0.73 this week and believes that the token price fell due to the rejection at the $0.70 key resistance.
 
 
“For XRP, we’d be very cautious here. Price has moved into a major resistance at $0.70 and has initially been rejected from this level. Alongside this, …]]></summary>

A transfer deemed high-priority, which formerly cost an average of $3.38, now demands a fee of $8.46. This significant increase was recorded on Thursday, November 9, 2023, at precisely 9:52 a.m. Eastern Time. This upsurge coincides with a backlog exceeding 200,000 pending transactions in Bitcoin’s mempool, a situation attributed to both the escalated fees and a recent spike in Ordinal inscriptions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blackrock may be taking steps toward obtaining approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the near future. This comes on the heels of the company’s application for an Ishares Ethereum Trust with the Delaware Division of Corporations on Thursday.
 
Speculation Rises on Blackrock’s Preparations for Spot Ether ETF Launch
 

 
As the world’s largest asset manager by assets under management, Blackrock has formally recorded its Ishares Ethereum Trust with Delaware’s Division of Corporations. The document, dated November 9, 2023, identifies the trust as statutory and acknowledges Blackrock Advisors as the filing party.
 

 
James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, called attention to the filing on the social platform X, verifying its authenticity. “Multiple people asking ‘is this real’ — yes it’s real,” Seyffart confirmed. “An entity with this name was indeed registered in Delaware. That’s all we can really confirm at this time. Those images are real and from the State of Delaware website.”
 

 

 

 
Market watchers speculate that Blackrock is positioning itself to introduce a spot ether ETF, subsequent to regulatory consent for its spot bitcoin ETF initiative. Blackrock’s submission for a spot bitcoin ETF was made on June 15, 2023, and the firm is currently awaiting the SEC’s decision.
 

 
In the meantime, ethereum’s (ETH) value has seen an uptick of over 5% in the last 24 hours, temporarily crossing the $2,000 mark per unit. The surge was a lot more pronounced following the circulation of the Blackrock story across social media networks. However, only time will reveal Blackrock’s next move with the Ishares ETH trust.
