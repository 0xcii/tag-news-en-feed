The below chart shows what the price action of the cryptocurrency has looked like recently.
 

 
 
During this latest plunge, BTC briefly slipped to a low under $57,000 before seeing a small rebound to the current $57,500 mark. This is the lowest that the asset has been since late February.

Scratching the Surface: Bitcoin Scripts Limitations
To understand covenant proposals like OP_CAT, it's crucial to grok the fundamental limitations of Bitcoin Script as it is today.
