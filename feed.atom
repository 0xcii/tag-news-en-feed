The extension of Gambaryan’s remand was granted by the Nigerian court yesterday (Tuesday) amid opposition from federal prosecutors to the appeal for bail. The crypto exchange’s executive has already pleaded not guilty to charges of tax evasion and money laundering.
Gambaryan holds the position of Head of Financial Crime Compliance at the crypto exchange. He and another fellow Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, who holds the position of its African Regional Manager, traveled to Nigeria in an official capacity earlier this year but were detained by local authorities.

By accepting donations in crypto such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets, non-profits are witnessing a surge in contributions, streamlining processes, and reaching new donor demographics.
 
 
This year alone, the two largest US charities have reportedly raised over $2 billion through crypto donations, according to a recent report by Bankless Times. This represents a massive leap from the $125 million collected in donations throughout 2022. The Giving Block, a platform facilitating digital currency donations for charities, has been instrumental in this shift.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The tides are shifting in the Bitcoin sea. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant, a blockchain analytics firm, paints a picture of a changing investor landscape, with a new breed of “whales” – high-volume crypto holders – entering the fray and established players holding their ground.
 
 
This influx of fresh capital is significant. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju reports that these “new whales,” likely hailing from traditional finance and entering through Bitcoin ETFs, have amassed a staggering $111 billion worth of Bitcoin. This edges the holdings of established, “long-term whales” whose collective stash sits at $67 billion.

The filing clarified that its US-based ODL services have shifted from using XRP to Tether (USDT) as a bridge currency.
 
Why Ripple Chose USDT
 
This strategic pivot was a response to the summary judgment in the SEC lawsuit which found that institutional sales fell under the US security laws. Since the ruling, non-US entities have been the sole contracting parties for XRP sales contracts to ODL customers. The filing highlights that “the company’s remaining ODL business in the United States uses a non-XRP bridge currency.”
