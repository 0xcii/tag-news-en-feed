        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto community was initially baffled by the massive fee of 83.65 BTC, originally attributed to a costly mistake. However, recent revelations paint a darker picture. According to a social media account on X called “@83_5BTC,” hackers stole the funds from the unnamed individual and immediately swept the bitcoin to a different wallet. 
 
Alleged Hacking Incident Tied to Bitcoin’s Massive 83.65 BTC Fee Error
 
The alleged victim, @83_5BTC, revealed that after transferring 139 BTC to a new cold wallet, the funds were immediately swept to another wallet by the attackers. The transaction split the sum, sending 55.77 BTC to the hackers’ wallet, while the rest, a staggering 83.65 BTC, was paid as a transaction fee. This incident surpasses the previous high-fee record of 19.8 BTC.
