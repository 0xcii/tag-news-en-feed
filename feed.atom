        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the fast-paced world of crypto, where trends come and go like the tides, one memecoin has managed to capture the attention of enthusiasts and skeptics alike: Shiba Inu. However, investor sentiment has deteriorated massively in recent months, as the price of the SHIB token has been in a descending trend channel since the beginning of February.
 
But there is new hope: since mid-May, there have been some positive trends for Shiba Inu: the network is growing strongly, and there is also a dwindling supply on the exchanges.
 
On-chain analysis firm Santiment has shed light on the remarkable surge in new daily addresses created for Shiba Inu, surpassing a staggering 2,500 per day (on average) over the past couple of weeks. This surge in activity has propelled SHIB into the spotlight, making i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The market share of the top cryptocurrency exchange  
Binance, and its US affiliate, Binance.US, has declined, the latest market data shows.  
The decline is anticipated to be due to the recent lawsuit filed against the exchange by the  
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The market share of  
Binance.US had dropped the most. According to the cryptocurrency data provider,  
Kaiko, as quoted by Reuters, the market share of the purportedly independent  
exchange dropped from 22% to 0.9% between April and June.    
Regulatory Troubles
Binance.US was dealt a  
blow when the SEC sought  
court orders to freeze

temporary freeze of the exchange’s assets would protect investors from losing  
their funds. However, th…]]></summary>

On May 25, Binance initially suspended the deposit of 10 Multichain-bridged tokens due to days-long delays in transaction time on the Multichain protocol.
 
A few days later, the debacle worsened when Multichain announced it could not contact its CEO Zhaojun.
 
As a result of its CEO being inaccessible, the team behind Multichain stated they couldn’t obtain the necessary server keys for the maintenance of some nodes, which affected the cross-chain operations of various networks, including ONUS, Omax, Findora, etc.
