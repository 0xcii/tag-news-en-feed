        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gemini, the prominent American cryptocurrency exchange, has made a significant announcement that’s sending ripples through the Canadian crypto community. Users will have a very short 90 days to request a withdrawal due to this move.
 
Gemini will shut all customer accounts in Canada with limited exclusions effective December 31, 2024, according to an email. Users who have depended on Gemini for digital asset transactions may be concerned about the future of crypto trading in Canada and the consequences of this sudden shift.
 
 
Regulatory Pressures Prompt Exit
 
Gemini withdrew its services once the CSA passed fresh rules. To keep serving consumers, the CSA mandated that all Canadian cryptocurrency trading platforms submit a pre-registration undertaking by February 22, 2024.

This drop follows Bitcoin’s recent two-month peak of $66,500, achieved just last Friday, which had ignited bullish sentiment among investors looking forward to the last quarter of the year. However, a series of geopolitical developments, particularly rising tensions in the Middle East, may test the resilience of risk assets like Bitcoin.
