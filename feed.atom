        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new malware has been identified by security experts, which specifically targets MacOS devices. The malware aims to steal confidential information such as saved passwords, credit card numbers, and data from more than 50 cryptocurrency browser extensions. This has raised significant concerns about the security of MacOS devices.
 
Reports suggest that cybercriminals are now able to purchase a new malware specifically designed for macOS called ‘Atomic’ (also known as ‘AMOS’) through private Telegram channels. This malware is being sold via a subscription model, where cybercriminals can access the malware for $1,000 per month.
 
 
The fact that the malware is being sold through private channels also makes it difficult for security agencies to track its distribution and take necessary action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brink, a Bitcoin development community, will use the donation to finance an annual salary of a developer contribution to Bitcoin.
Samara Asset Group, an alternative asset manager with a focus on Bitcoin, has donated $150,000 to Brink, a charitable Bitcoin development community. The donation will be used to finance the annual salary of a developer contributing to the growth and development of the Bitcoin network. Samara has committed to continuing this donation for the next three years.
The Bitcoin protocol is unique in that it has no foundation or corporate entity supporting its development. The pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared roughly a decade ago, leaving the Bitcoin community to oversee its development. Charitable organizations, such as Brink, have become a popular method for donors to contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
“At Samara, we believe the future of global capital markets are decentralized and democratized, with Bitcoin playing a vital role in the development of this inclusive financial world,” said Patrick Lowry, Samara CEO. “We are proud to back Bitcoin builders, not only by investing in many of the world’s best companies building infrastructure for Bitcoin, but now by donating to Brink to finance a developer for the next three years."
Mike Schmidt, Executive Director of Brink, expressed his gratitude for Samara's contribution to the Bitcoin community. "Bitcoin development is a common good and relies on organizations like Samara and individuals like Patrick to recognize the importance furthering the security, stability, and advancement of the Bitcoin software that underpins much of the entire industry," he said.
Samara's donation demonstrates its commitment to seeing the Bitcoin community thrive. The company is reportedly exploring an international listing in order to increase trading liquidity and reach new prospective shareholders.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
