users can deposit their coins to earn rewards,  has intensified  
competition among exchanges in South Korea, The Korea Times reported. This service has  
expanded the scale of staking into trillions of dollars and introduced  
service brokerage fees as a new source of income for exchanges.
Crypto Staking Gain Momentum
Staking services, where investors deposit their coins  
to validate blockchain networks and receive rewards, have recently gained traction in  
the cryptocurrency market. Unlike traditional bank deposits, exchanges do not  
manage the coins but act as proxies and charge brokerage fees for the service.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 13, 2024
 
 
 
The platform is hosted at bitcoin.gob.sv, provides real-time data on the nation's bitcoin reserves. 
Using public information from Bukele's tweets and blockchain data, the site details how the country has accumulated over 5,748 BTC worth roughly $360 million. 
This stash has been built up since 2021 through daily purchases of 1 BTC, larger bulk buys, and mining via geothermal energy.
Earlier, Bukele had released a Bitcoin address for people to monitor the nation's holdings. Now, the new website validates this information and offers public proof of reserves. 
Launching this platform represents a major step towards financial transparency in government operations.By leveraging Bitcoin's innate audibility, El Salvador continues leading the way.

Despite short-term fluctuations, the country already sits on $57 million in unrealized profit due to effective dollar cost averaging.
El Salvador's Bitcoin treasury tracker promotes openness and confidence in its pioneering Bitcoin strategy. 
This economic experiment and embrace of Bitcoin set an example for other nations to follow. The website should also help attract further Bitcoin investment and innovation in El Salvador.]]></summary>
