When this indicator’s value goes up, the miners are connecting more mining rigs to the network. Such a trend can indicate that these chain validators are now finding the coin attractive to mine.
 
On the other hand, the metric’s value decreasing suggests some miners disconnect from the blockchain, possibly because they aren’t making any profits.
