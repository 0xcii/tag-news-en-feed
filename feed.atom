I grew up in Germany as the oldest of four brothers. My father worked at the local energy company but outside of that he was always politically active. Aged 16, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) — equivalent to the Democrats in the USA. His

It has proven versatile and stable across upheavals and social changes. It even became a vital tool in global trade and currency exchange as we know it today.
In the 19th century, gold was the backbone of the global monetary system. Nations relied on the gold standard until the Great Depression and World War I. These events were significant inflationary catalysts, and economies, in a decades-long transition, abandoned the gold standard. 
This process culminated in 1971 when the Federal Exchange could no longer exchange US dollars for gold. In 1976, the gold standard was abandoned entirely, and gold became a free asset.

The Role of Ordinals in Bitcoin
Bitcoin ordinals refer to the unique identification numbers assigned to each satoshi on the blockchain. They serve as a timestamp and help establish the order in which satoshis occur. Ordinal theory enables participants to verify the chronology of satoshis, ensuring that the network reaches a consensus on the state of the blockchain.
When a Bitcoin transaction takes place, it is recorded on the blockchain, which is essentially a decentralized ledger. Each satoshi is assigned a unique ordinal number, which acts as a digital fingerprint. This ordinal number is generated using complex cryptographic algorithms, making it virtually impossible to tamper with or forge.

MicroStrategy's journey into Bitcoin began in August 2020 when it first announced its entry into the world of digital assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that showcases the expanding demand for Bitcoin, St. Galler Kantonalbank (SGKB) has become the latest major Swiss bank to offer Bitcoin and crypto buying services.
Announced Thursday, SGKB partnered with SEBA Bank to offer its retail customers cryptocurrency trading and custody services, a venture that marks another step in the expanding world of crypto adoption within the Swiss banking sector.
SGKB already enabled the service for high net worth clients.
The partnership between SGKB and crypto bank SEBA was forged earlier this year, and after a swift implementation phase, SGKB is now facilitating the trading and custody of digital assets, starting with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).
This move follows Zuger Kantonalbank's recent launch of a similar crypto offering in late October and Luzerner Kantonalbank, which debuted its service in August.
Falk Kohlmann, Head of Market Services at St. Galler Kantonalbank, expressed enthusiasm for the development, stating: "We are pleased to offer access to digital assets and the digital economy to a select group of customers."
It's important to note that, initially, SGKB's crypto offerings are limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, upon request, clients may explore investments in other cryptocurrencies. According to SEBA's website, the crypto bank provides cold storage for a range of digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, and others.
Looking ahead, the move enables SGKB clients to manage their cryptocurrencies alongside existing investments, a development that could become increasingly common in the years ahead.
With SGKB, the fifth largest cantonal bank, joining the Bitcoin fray, the path to mainstream adoption becomes increasingly clear.]]></summary>
