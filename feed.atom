Bitcoin's (BTC) mixed summer performance, one of Wall

Wall Street Bitcoin Miner  
Riot Increases Production
According  
to Riot's report published  
this week, BTC mining in July reached 370 tokens, growing significantly  
from the 255 reported in June when Bitcoin prices were falling sharply.  
Although this is 10% less than in July 2023 (410 BTC), considering the average  
prices from these two periods, Riot would earn much more from the smaller  
number of Bitcoins mined last month.

The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator devised by Alternative that basically tells us about the sentiment the average trader holds towards the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market right now.
 
 
This indicator determines the sentiment using data of the following five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends.
