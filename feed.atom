This trial stems from charges related to the catastrophic collapse of TerraUSD (UST) and Luna (LUNA) cryptocurrencies in May 2022, an event that erased approximately $40 billion from the cryptocurrency markets.
 
Do Kwon Continues To Oppose Extradition To The US

In the last day, the meme coin’s price has risen by over 50% amid wild speculation and bullishness as the Bitcoin price touched $57,000 for the first time in more than two years.
