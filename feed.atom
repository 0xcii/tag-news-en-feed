The report states, “The multi-chain era has had a sweeping impact on the distribution of illicit crypto volume as a whole, where Bitcoin’s share plummeted from 97% in 2016 to 19% in 2022. In 2016, two thirds of crypto hack volume was on Bitcoin; in 2022, it accounted for just under 3%, with Ethereum (68%) and Binance Smart Chain (19%) dominating the field. And while Bitcoin was the exclusive currency for terrorist financing in 2016, by 2022 it was all but replaced by assets on the TRON blockchain, with 92%.”

The current price of ether stands at $2,247, with a 24-hour range fluctuating between $2,246 and $2,284. Despite its substantial market capitalization of $270 billion, ether trading volume remains modest, hinting at possible investor wariness.
 
Ethereum
 
The hourly chart of ethereum (ETH) paints a picture of a volatile ether market. Prices swing from $2,246 to $2,284, signaling opportunities for short-term trading or day traders.

According to CoinGeko, Jupiter has recorded over $510 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours, surpassing Ethereum’s Uniswap V3 and V2, which recorded $455 and $76 million respectively.

The cash holding almost doubled from $2.3 billion at the end of October, according to Chapter 11 monthly operating reports.
Selling Crypto for Cash
First reported by Bloomberg, the bankruptcy administrators of the crypto exchange sold its crypto assets to raise $1.8 billion last month. The figure only considers the four largest affiliates, including FTX Trading Ltd and Alameda Research LLC, meaning it could go higher if all the affiliates are considered.
The exchange additionally confirmed trading derivatives to hedge exposure on its digital asset holdings and earned extra yield.
