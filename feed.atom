of a record number of clients, as well as outlined the exchange's plans for 
2024.
Bitget’s Spot Trading

Although 
Bitget originally focused on crypto derivatives, the company reopened its spot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has issued a directive,  
instructing banks to deny virtual asset providers (VASPs) the status of  
merchants for credit card transactions. This move signals Taiwan's cautious  
approach to cryptocurrencies, creating a significant ripple in the global  
financial landscape. As a result, credit card usage for cryptocurrency  
purchases is effectively blocked in Taiwan, prompting discussions on the  
broader implications for the payments industry.
FSC's Concerns and Equations with High-Risk Transactions
The FSC's directive, circulated to the Banking Association, highlights  
concerns over the speculative and high-risk nature of virtual assets. The  
regulator emphasizes that credit cards should primarily serve as consumer
