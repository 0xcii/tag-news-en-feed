Binance's plans to adhere to the UK's new crypto marketing regulations. This  
occurred after its partner in the UK, Rebuildingsociety.com, was barred from approving  
crypto advertisements in the country.
The cryptocurrency exchange, not being registered  
with the FCA, had partnered with Rebuildingsociety.com just ahead of the  
implementation of new crypto promotion rules. This partnership was aimed at  
securing approval for the crypto exchange's communications and advertisements. 
FCA's New Crypto Marketing Rules
The new rules mandate crypto firms to register with the FCA  
to independently approve their promotions and advertisements. However, the  
rules allow unregistered crypto firms to seek approval from authorized  
entities.

Drawing upon a mix of legal stances, technological advancements, and market dynamics, he crafted a detailed discourse on why he believes the token’s future is luminous.
 
Bullish On XRP: Reasons #1 And #2
 
The first reason to be bullish on the cryptocurrency is the legal standing in the US “Only digital asset in the US with legal clarity,” he began, further elaborating, that it’s the “only digital asset officially declared not a security.” His statements allude to the unique position of XRP in the crypto market.

According to the seven-day simple moving average (SMA), it touched an impressive 440 exahash per second (EH/s). Notably, less than 200 days remain until the next block reward halving, equating to being roughly 28,468 blocks away.
 
Amid Global Tensions, Bitcoin Miners Navigate Record Hashrates and Halving Countdown
 
The countdown to Bitcoin’s halving is ticking away. As of now, 197 days remain, positioning the event on or about April 25, 2024. Yet, some trackers project an earlier date of April 21, 2024, and there’s even calculations showing a March 2024 occurrence.

Judge Kaplan Displeased At Defense’s Repetitive Questions
 
On October 5 (Day 3 of SBF’s trial), Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers cross-examined Adam Yedidia, a close friend of SBF and former employee of FTX. During the proceedings, the judge seemed frustrated at the defense’s line of questioning as he stated, “You’ve made your point. Move on. We’ve been up and down this mountain.”
 
 
Still, on the cross-examination, the defense tried to lay a foundation that SBF wasn’t vain or lavish when they asked Yedidia if they knew what k…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon fell for a fourth straight session on Tuesday, as traders pushed the cryptocurrency to a ten-day low. The decline comes as the global market cap remained in the red, having fallen by 0.37% at the time of writing. On the other hand, cosmos rebounded from its lowest point since mid-September.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) extended a recent losing streak in today’s session, as price fell for a fourth consecutive day.
 
Following a high of $0.5396 to start the week, MATIC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.5241 earlier in the day.
 
This move resulted in the cryptocurrency falling to its weakest point since September 29, when price bottomed out at $0.5163.
 
 
From the chart, it seems as though sellers are attempting to push MATIC to a support point at $0.5070.
 
In order to achieve this, the relative strength index (RSI) will need to hit its own floor at 40.00. It is currently sitting at 43.75.
 
Bulls may also be waiting to reenter the market, the closer polygon gets to the aforementioned support.
 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
After finding its own level of support to start the week, cosmos (ATOM) rebounded strongly on Tuesday.
 
ATOM/USD jumped to a peak at $7.14 earlier in today’s session, less than a day after trading at a low of $6.63.
 
Monday’s bottom was the lowest level that cosmos had hit since September 15, which is the last time price broke out of a floor at $6.65.
 
 
Today’s bounce comes as bulls rejected this downward sentiment, and they now look to be targeting a resistance zone of $7.60.
 
A upcoming ceiling at the 48.00 level on the RSI indicator will likely pose a big threat to this prospect occurring.

Ethereum Has Declined Under The $1,600 Mark Recently
 
Around the start of this month, Ethereum enjoyed some sharp upward momentum as the cryptocurrency reached the $1,750 level. Since that peak, however, the coin has struggled, as its price has now declined again under the $1,600 mark.
 
Yesterday, ETH even retested a brief $1,550, but the asset quickly found a rebound and has so far held above the level, as the chart below shows.
 

 
 
The bounce has been small, however, meaning that Ethereum could be in danger of making another retest of the $1,550 level in the coming days. Something that may hold hints regarding if more decline is coming could be the investor…]]></summary>

cryptocurrency exchange FTX enters its second week, his legal team has sought  
permission from Judge Lewis Kaplan to cross-examine Gary Wang, the Co-Founder of  
FTX, about the legal advice he received regarding loans obtained from Alameda  
Research. 
In a letter addressed to Judge Kaplan yesterday (Monday), prosecutors  
have already questioned Wang about the substantial loans he allegedly received  
from the hedge fund, which he used for venture investments and to buy a house in the  
Bahamas. SBF's defense argues that Wang believed these loans were legitimate  
and had been structured by lawyers. This perspective aims to challenge the idea  
that these loans were intended to conceal the source of the funds.
