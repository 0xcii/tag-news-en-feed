Crypto analyst BitLuxe revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin was trading near crucial support between $0.146 and $0.151. He then suggested that it may be time to go long on the foremost meme coin, although with a tight stop loss, possibly due to the uncertainty that is still in the market.

As pointed out by analyst James Van Straten in a post on X, the Bitcoin transaction fees have once again flipped that of Ethereum. The “transaction fees” here naturally refer to the fees that all senders on any network have to attach their transfers as a reward for the validator who handles them.
 
The fees on the blockchain are generally related to the activity it’s serving at the moment. During times of high traffic, the mempool can become congested. As the validators only have a limited capacity to process transactions, transfers can remain stuck waiting…]]></summary>

The end goal of the cartoon was to propose a new mechanism for moving in and out of scaling layers built on top of Bitcoin. To disentangle that actual proposal from the cartoon, we’ll have to break down the two pieces involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin halving event, a pivotal occurrence, is scheduled for April, 19 2024. This quadrennial event will reduce the block subsidy for Bitcoin miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, thereby halving the reward that miners receive for their efforts. Such events have historically led to profound shifts in the mining landscape, potentially influencing various economic and operational facets of Bitcoin mining.
Economic Outlook and Market Predictions
After the halving, the immediate impact is a considerable decrease in miner revenue due to the reduced block subsidy. This could lead to a decline in the hashrate as less efficient miners may turn unprofitable and exit the network.
