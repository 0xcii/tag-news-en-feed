        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trust will utilize three separate key holders to offer the benefits of multisignature custody to institutional investors.
Onramp Bitcoin has launched the first-ever spot bitcoin trust product that employs multi-party custody. This product is tailored to high-net-worth individuals, corporations and institutions seeking to gain exposure to bitcoin, according to a press release. 
The trust product will utilize three institutional-grade key holders, a qualified custodian named Kingdom Trust, and Bitcoin custody service firm Unchained Capital, to ensure that the custody of client bitcoin has no single point of failure. 
Onramp is the first trust to leverage a multi-signature setup, requiring a quorum to move funds. The product is designed for those who want exposure to bitcoin without the tradeoffs of full third-party custody, but who are not yet ready to take on the responsibility of full self-custody.
According to the press release, Onramp's solution is also intended to address the limitations of existing Bitcoin fund vehicles, including single-point-of-failure custody, taxable events on withdrawal and lack of Bitcoin focus and education. 
The trust will have a “Bitcoin-only focus with a commitment to education and advisory services to help clients excel during periods of volatility,” the press release describes.
The product will also offer segregated accounts with the ability to take possession of the underlying bitcoin without incurring a taxable event.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ada-surges-to-7-month-high-as-xrp-extends-recent-gains/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-14T15:43:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano rose to its highest level in seven-months on April 14, as cryptocurrency markets remained bullish. The global crypto market cap rose by as much as 2.25% on Friday, with bitcoin moving above $31,000. Xrp was another notable gainer, as the token hit a two-week high.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) rose for an eighth straight session on Friday, with today’s gains sending the token to a seven-month high.
 
ADA/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.4441 earlier in today’s session, after trading at a low of $0.4115 on Thursday.
 
Friday’s surge in price saw cardano climb to its strongest point since September 27, when prices hit a high of $0.4631.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s jump came following a breakout of a key resistance level of $0.4230.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) also moved beyond its own ceiling at 65.00, and is currently tracking at 71.06.
 
An upcoming ceiling at 72.00 now awaits ADA bulls, and should they fail to move past this point, earlier gains may fade.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was once again in the green, as the token continued to move away from a recent price floor.
 
Following a low of $0.5092 on Thursday, XRP/USD rose to a high of $0.5438 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s move in price, XRP moved to its highest level since March 29, when the token hit a then eleven-month high of $0.5848.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that one catalyst for the move was the 14-day RSI bouncing from a floor at 57.00.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 62.97, which is marginally below a point of resistance at the 63.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5274, which is slightly lower than its earlier peak.

Each winner of a Historic Cover inscription will also receive a physical copy of the Bitcoin Magazine issue they purchased, further highlighting the unique history and scarcity of these publications.
David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, said, "We're experimenting at the edge of Bitcoin innovation and venturing into uncharted territory.

Stablecoins Purport to Be Money
 
According to the Bank of England (BOE) governor, Andrew Bailey, stablecoins can only function as money if they attain the characteristics of “inside money” and when they are regulated as such. Bailey also claimed the BOE had determined that stablecoins lack the “assured value” the public expects to see in digital money.
