The settlement, which addressed allegations of money laundering and sanctions evasion, marked a pivotal moment for Binance.
 
Since November 21, when the settlement was reached, Binance has experienced a surge in net inflows, amounting to roughly $4.6 billion. This data, revealed in a post by Satoshi Club on X, shows the platform’s resilience amid these challenges.

Earlier in the month, the much-anticipated Bitcoin spot ETFs finally gained approval from the US SEC. The BTC spot ETFs are financial instruments that allow investors to gain indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency’s price movements.
 
This means that, with the spot ETF, traders don’t need to own the asset itself to gain exposure to it. ETFs trade on traditional exchanges, so they may be a preferable option for traditional investors.
