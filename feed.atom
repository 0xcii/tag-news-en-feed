Instead, the administration aims to collaborate with Congress to establish a “comprehensive and balanced” regulatory framework that promotes responsible development and innovation in the crypto assets and payment sectors.

Pizza Day is often viewed with a sense of regret.
The well-known story goes like this: many years ago, Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John’s pizzas, and in return, some fortunate person received 10,000 BTC.236 This tale resembles that of Peter Minuit purchasing Manhattan Island for a mere $24. It’s hard to believe such a transaction took place, considering the current value.
The story has several intriguing aspects. It marked the first real-world good or service purchased with Bitcoin. It also established Bitcoin’s price; since the two pizzas cost around $41, one BTC was…]]></summary>

Bitcoin, Not Blockchain
Bitcoin, not blockchain. This has been a prominent meme throughout the past two epochs, guiding noobs towards a Bitcoin-only way of life, away from the fraudulent “cryptos” promising greater “blockchain tech”. Yet, here we are, more focused than ever on the blockchain. But this time it’s different: The whole world has a laser-eyed focus on the Bitcoin blockchain. The driving force for this attention is a new meta protocol — a protocol that rides on top of the Bitcoin protocol — called Ordinals. Ordinals is a …]]></summary>
