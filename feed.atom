His recent comment after a member of the XRP community dug up past remarks that the Cardano founder had made on this same subject.  
 
Why ADA Will Not Work With XRP
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Hoskinson explained that the reason ADA will not partner with XRP is because of the “two years of daily harassment” by the XRP community. He also highlighted the “lack of technical overlap” between both tokens and the “different product market fit” as other reasons why a partnership is unlikely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an appearance on CNBC today, the CEO of Grayscale Investments, Michael Sonnenshein, shared insights regarding the potential impact of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) on the cryptocurrency market. Sonnenshein highlighted that a spot Bitcoin ETF could "unlock" around "$30 trillion worth of advised wealth."



Sonnenshein discussed the significance of introducing a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States, emphasizing the vast pool of wealth held within advised assets and the substantial opportunity a regulated Bitcoin ETF could present to tap into these resources.
"When we look ahead to the hopeful approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, it really is going to unlock the opportunity to a part of the investment community that for better or worse has been locked out for the opportunity to participate in having Bitcoin exposure in their portfolio," Sonnenshein said. "We're really taking about the advised market here in the US. Which is today, about $30 trillion worth of advised wealth that we hope the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the up-listing of GBTC, will allow for that opportunity and for those investors to partake in it as well."
According to Sonnenshein, the introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF would open the doors for financial advisors and institutional investors to participate in the Bitcoin market more seamlessly. This influx of institutional capital into the market could be substantial, representing a significant step towards mainstream institutional adoption and recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class.
As discussions around approving a spot Bitcoin ETF persist within regulatory circles, Sonnenshein's comments add weight to the potential impact such an ETF could have on the broader financial landscape. The unlocking of vast advised wealth, as envisioned by Sonnenshein, might significantly alter the dynamics of Bitcoin's market participation and pave the way for increased institutional involvement in the space.]]></summary>
