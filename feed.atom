        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While to the greater Bitcoin culture, Bitcoin halvings are seen as a celebratory event, for miners, things tend to be a tad stressful. As Bitcoiners around the world gather to celebrate block 840,000, miners are hunkering down and preparing for their reward for mining blocks to decrease by 50%, while the cost of their operations remains the same.
With the next bitcoin halving scheduled to occur on April 19, one might imagine that Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining company in the world, might be worried. But after sitting down with Thiel just days before the halving, he doesn’t appear to be breaking a sweat.

Bitcoin ETF Buyers Will Soon Bail Out
 
Being known for holding unconventional opinions, investors are drawn to Peter Schiff‘s cautious approach, which raises the possibility of market instability. According to Schiff, the price of Bitcoin is currently trading below 26 ounces of Gold, which is a 30% drop from its record high witnessed approximately 2 and half years ago.
 
 
He further noted that the long-term bear market for Bitcoin is picking up speed again, and all the new investors of BTC ETFs will be riding along for the tri…]]></summary>

This debate comes at a time when Bitcoin’s status as a crisis hedge is being challenged due to a recent drop in its price while gold and silver experienced gains.
 
 
Bitcoin is down nearly 4% today while gold and silver are up nicely today.
 
That’s further confirmation that Bitcoin is a risk asset (like high-flying, speculative tech stocks) rather than a crisis hedge, which is why i…]]></summary>
