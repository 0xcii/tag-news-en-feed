        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polkadot (DOT) bulls were in luck this week. After overcoming a hot sell pressure zone, they’ve been able to push the crypto up by 70%, building on the impressive upswing in the last month.
 
Here’s a quick glance at how DOT has been performing lately:
 
 
DOT price up by 0.43%
 
Polkadot bulls eyeing $8
 
DOT upside potential is at 35%
 
 
 
DOT has been trading under $6 for much of February, but last week it broke above the range and hit $7, the supply zone at which it would have likely fallen into a correction. But instead of falling into that trap, DOT bounced back from $7 and flipped resistance into support.

Gemini Co-Founder on Next Crypto Bull Run
 
Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, believes that the next crypto bull run will come from the East. He tweeted Sunday:
 

My working thesis [at the moment] is that the next bull run is going to start in the East. It will be a humbling reminder that crypto is a global asset class.
 
“The West, really the U.S., always only ever had two options: embrace it or be left behind. It can’t be stopped. That we know,” he emphasized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency ranked by market cap. A recent Merge “upgrade” to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and other changes raised discussion of a possible “flippening” — a situation where Ethereum unseats Bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency in the market. 
 
Instead, Ethereum’s dominance could be in “grave” danger, if an ominous-sounding Japanese candlestick pattern is a prelude of what’s to come across the crypto market. 
 
Lagging Performance Against Crypto Leaves ETH.D Exposed To Danger
 
While Ethereum might be up by 90% from its bear market low compared to Bitcoin’s 50%, when comparing year-to-date returns BTC’s 50% gain against USD beats ETH’s mere 40%. From this metric alone, it’s obvious that Ethereum has been lagging behind Bitcoin.

Galois joins the ranks of BlockFi, Sequoia Capital, Genesis and other firms that have been caught in the FTX crossfire.
 
It takes time for dominos to fall, and despite FTX’s collapse being nearly 4 months in the making, Galois’ collapse is not a surprise for some. Let’s review what’s been revealed in the early stages of the firm’s shutdown.
 
Early Stages: What We Know So Far 
It’s a large fall from grace from what was one of crypto’s largest hedge funds; Galois at one point managed nearly a quarter of a billion dollars worth of assets at it’s peak. In November, immediately following FTX’s fall, it was largely believed that G…]]></summary>

Crypto Hedge Fund Shuts Down Due to FTX Collapse
 
Crypto hedge fund Galois Capital is shutting down as nearly half of its assets are trapped on FTX, the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange which filed for bankruptcy in November last year. “Galois Capital is a crypto hedge fund that specializes in over-the-counter trading and algorithmic market-making,” its website describes.

As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, previous BTC rallies saw the metric increase in value. The “active addresses” is an indicator that measures the daily total number of Bitcoin addresses involved in some transaction activity on the chain.
 
The metric accounts for both the senders and receivers and counts unique addresses. It means that if an address has made multiple transactions throughout the day, it will still be included only once.
 
When the indicator is high, it often means many addresses are participating in some network activity. Such a trend implies that the blockchain i…]]></summary>
