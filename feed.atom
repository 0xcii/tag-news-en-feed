In exchange for the work they do securing the network, they are rewarded by the same network they protect. This sound and elegant design by Satoshi is surely one of the most remarkable aspects of Bitcoin.
What is increasingly being forgotten, however, is that there is more to mining than merely hashing.
A person engaging in the entire process must run a node to get reliably updated on the most recent state of the blockchain, then begin construction of a new block. This involves verifying the validity of the previous block, discovering unconfirmed transactions and usually selecting the most lucrative of them, constructing a generation transaction in which they pay themselves, building multiple merkle trees of these transactions, an…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, is set to step down from his role from the company as he plead guilty to money laundering violations, according to the Wall Street Journal. Binance, as a company, will also plead guilty and pay $4.3 billion fine.
This news arrives in the wake of the conclusion of a criminal investigation around the cryptocurrency exchange. The investigation centered on alleged regulatory breaches and illicit activities within Binance. And now, the finale of this probe seems to have prompted a leadership transition.
The investigation's official outcome is happening today, as earlier this morning Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is announcing Binances' settlement later in the afternoon. This came right after the DOJ announced major cryptocurrency enforcement actions will be taken today as well.
CZ has been a massive figure in the cryptocurrency world, steering Binance's meteoric rise to become the globe's largest crypto exchange platform by trading volume. His departure from the helm of Binance could mark a significant shift in the industry.
Amidst this wave of news, Binance has not yet officially confirmed CZ's departure plans, and CZ himself has so far refrained from commenting publicly on the matter.]]></summary>

Bitcoin 7-Day MA Puell Multiple Has Surged Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Puell Multiple is currently at the second highest level for the year. The “Puell Multiple” is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the daily Bitcoin miner revenue and the 365-day moving average (MA) of the same.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the miners are currently earning more than the average for the past year. On the other hand, the indicator being below the mark suggests these chain validators are making less than usual right now.

He ran on a platform promising substantial reforms: cutting spending, reducing government intervention, addressing inflation, and eliminating the central bank.
Milei's path to victory was unexpected. In the general elections, he secured second place with 30% of the vote, trailing Sergio Massa of the Peronist establishment, who garnered 37%. Patricia Bullrich, former Minister of Security under President Macri's administration, obtained 24%. These results forced Balotaje, or a run-off election between Massa and Milei.
