        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) has raised concerns about the exclusion of decentralized finance, or DeFi, from the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The AFME’s latest commentary points towards the necessity of creating an all-inclusive regulatory framework that covers both traditional financial services and DeFi.
 
AFME, a prominent entity in European financial markets, expressed apprehension about leaving decentralized activities out of regulatory purviews. They stressed that such exclusions could potentially instigate regulatory arbitrage and dilute the effectiveness of the regulatory frameworks set to emerge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jesse  
Powell, the Co-Founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken who stepped down  
as CEO last year, recently faced an investigation by the Federal  
Bureau of Investigation (FBI). According to the New York Times, the probe was based on allegations that he hacked and cyber-stalked a non-profit arts centre he established  
in  
2007.
Powell Faced Federal Investigation
The Times,  
citing unnamed sources, reported yesterday (Thursday) that the Verge Centre for the  
Arts, the California-based non-profit organization, accused Powell of disrupting its  
computer accounts and preventing access to emails and other messages. Powell’s  
lawyer confirmed the investigation to CoinDesk today (Friday).
Furthermore, the Times  
in its report said the FBI and the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of  
California have been probing Powell since at least the last fall. As part of  
the investigation, FBI agents reportedly searched the crypto entrepreneur's home in Los Angeles earlier in March and confiscated electronic devices. However, the Kraken Co-Founder has not been  
accused of any crimes.
In 2022,  
Verge removed Powell from its Board of Directors, saying the former Kraken CEO  
contravened its ‘guiding principles’, The Times reported, citing a court document. To counter the move, Powell filed a lawsuit against Verge last month, claiming that remains a Board Member of the non-profit organization, Brandon Fox, Powell’s  
lawyer told CoinDesk in a statement. 
The crypto entrepreneur also claimed that he owns and has  
‘rightful access’ to Verge's email accounts. However, Fox pointed out that the case  
is not related to the entrepreneur’s activities 'in the cryptocurrency  
arena'. He added that Powell 'did nothing wrong'.

However, the exchange and its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao seem to be unfazed by this. While the negative news spreads it has mostly been limited to social media platforms, while the exchange itself continues to thrive.
 
CZ Says Binance Is Not FTX
 
One rumor that has followed the number of problems that the crypto exchange has been subject to over the last month is that Binance could be facing bankruptcy. Given the fact that the FTX exchange collapsed following massive FUD on social media that triggered a bank run, there have been speculations that Binance could go the same way.

Finance, or DeFi, has emerged as one of the financial industry's most  
transformational and disruptive forces. DeFi protocols, which are based on  
blockchain technology, aim to eliminate middlemen, and allow open,  
permissionless access to financial services. 
While the  
potential benefits of DeFi are significant, its rapid rise has created legal  
and regulatory issues that must be addressed. In this article, we'll look at  
the legal and regulatory ambiguities surrounding DeFi, as well as the attempts  
being made to manage them.

DeFi and Its Applications
Decentralized

Bitcoin Difficulty Regression Model Puts Cost Of Production At $22,900 Per BTC
 
In a new tweet, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has looked into the current profitability of the BTC miners. Naturally, to estimate the profits that these chain validators might be making, the cost of production that they incur needs to be known first.
 
To find this cost, the analytics firm has used its “difficulty regression model.” According to Glassnode, the model “is an estimated all-in-sustaining cost of production for Bitcoin (for the average miner).”
 
As its name may already imply, the model is based on the “mining difficulty” metric. The difficulty is a feature on the BTC…]]></summary>

An “over-unity” power generator (similar to the concept of a perpetual-motion machine) is a hypothetical device that produces more energy than is required to run it. Although there is quite a bit of controversy in this field, the mainstream scientific consensus is that over-unity power generation is impossible, because it defies the first law of thermodynamics. 
According to this law, energy can undergo transformations from one form to another, but the total amount of energy within a closed system remains constant. This principle is derived from empirical observations and has been validated through numerous experiments and theoretical frameworks. 
In practical terms, this means that energy can neither…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin dropped below the $30,000 level on Friday, ahead of the upcoming nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report in the United States. Today’s report comes as private sector jobs rose by 497,000 in the last report, double the expected number. Friday’s NFP is projected to come in at 225,000. Ethereum hit a one-week low today. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to a one-week low on Friday, ahead of the upcoming nonfarm payrolls report in the United States.
 
Payrolls are expected to come in at 225,000 for June, less than the 339,000 jobs added the month prior.
 
Many believe a strong number will almost certainly guarantee that the Federal Reserve will hike rates later this month.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 

 
BTC/USD dropped to a low at $29,777.28 earlier in the session, which is its lowest point since last Friday, when price fell to $29,417.
 
Today’s sell-off came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) plunged to a floor at the 55.00 mark.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has shifted course, and now looks to be downward facing.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also plunged in today’s session, dropping below the $1,900 mark for the first time since the end of June.
 
Following a high at $1,917.61 on Thursday, ETH/USD fell to an intraday low of $1,832.03 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the lowest point ETH has hit since June 30, when the price collided with a support point at $1,820.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
ETH has since rebounded from today’s earlier low, and is currently trading at $1,862.52, as bulls have seemingly bought the dip.
 
This comes as the RSI found a floor of its own at 47.00, and has gone on to reach a present point of 49.86.
 
The next visible resistance level looks as though it is at 53.00, and if it hits that point, it is likely ethereum will be near $1,890.

While the specific cryptocurrency being mined remains undisclosed, it is worth noting that Bitcoin (BTC) continues to reign supreme among mining operations, particularly after Ethereum made the momentous shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism last year.
