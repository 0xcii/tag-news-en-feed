        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was one of the standout gainers during a quiet session, as the meme coin raced to a multi-month high. Prices rose as traders continued to react to a recent tweet from Elon Musk. Another notable gainer was polkadot, which rose nearly 7% higher.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was a notable mover during Friday’s session, as the meme coin climbed to a multi-month high. This occurred as price continued its reaction to a recent Elon Musk tweet.
 
Following a low of $0.06855 on Thursday, DOGE/USD surged to an intraday peak of $0.07639 earlier today.
 
This resulted in dogecoin hitting its strongest point since May 6, when its price peaked above $0.0800.
 
 
One of the catalysts behind today’s move was a breakout of the 62.00 level on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is now at 64.24, with an upcoming resistance point of 66.00 a possible target for buyers.
 
Earlier momentum has marginally faded, with DOGE now trading at $0.074.
 
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Additionally, polkadot (DOT) also rallied to end the week, as the token rose by as much as 7% in today’s session.
 
DOT/USD jumped to a high of $5.69 on Friday, which was a day after the price fell to a bottom at $5.15.
 
As a result of this rally, polkadot peaked at its highest level since last Friday, when it reached a then two-month high of $5.74.
 
 
The token edged lower after bulls were unable to extend gains towards a key resistance level of $6.00.
 
Overall, this appeared to come as price strength failed to surge past its own ceiling at the 60.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the indicator is now closing in on this point, and in the event it breaks beyond this zone, DOT will likely climb past the $6.00 mark.

In its latest insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has looked into the various indicators of the asset to see what the near future outcome of its price might be.
 
The first metric of relevance here is the “social dominance,” which, in short, tells us what percentage of discussions on social media platforms related to the 100 largest assets by market cap in the sector are coming from Ethereum alone.

Recent allegations by prominent crypto researcher @ErgoBTC and a tweet by Adam Cochran have raised serious questions about the backing of TRC-20 Bitcoin on the Tron network.
 
With approximately 60,000 Bitcoin potentially unbacked, the Bitcoin community and the wider crypto industry are left wondering about the true state of affairs. The controversy centers around a potentially unbacked mint of 60.000 BTC TRC20 (worth $1.2billion) by Justin Sun and a transfer to JustLend, a decentralized lending platform on the Tron blockchain, for a 600 million USDC loan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin dropped below the $30,000 level on Jul 21, as market sentiment continued to trend lower in today’s session. This comes a week after cryptocurrency markets surged following the XRP ruling, however momentum has since faded as a result of profit taking. Ethereum was also down on Friday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) remained in the red on Friday, as the cryptocurrency moved back below the $30,000 level.
 
After hitting a high of $30,406.45 on Thursday, BTC/USD fell to a bottom at $29,638.10 earlier in the day.
 
This decline resulted in bitcoin moving near Tuesday’s floor at $29,525, which was a one-month low.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 
The latest sell-off came as the relative strength index (RSI) dropped below a key support point at 49.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 48.09, with the 46.00 mark a potential target for sellers.
 
Additionally, the 10-day (red) moving average has begun separating from its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could be a sign of an upcoming downturn.
 
 
Ethereum
 
After making a strong rebound on Thursday, ethereum (ETH) was largely lower in today’s session.
 
ETH/USD edged to a bottom at $1,879.73 earlier today, which comes a day after peaking around $1,920.
 
Friday’s sell-off briefly sent ethereum below a support level of $1,880, however bulls have since moved to stabilize this floor.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Unlike with BTC, ethereum’s 10-day (red) moving average remains upwards facing, which could be a sign of sentiment in the market being bullish.
 
In order to validate this theory, there will first have to be a breakout on the RSI, in particular of a ceiling at 52.00.
 
The index is currently tracking at 49.86.
