A recent report by CoinKickoff demonstrates the failures of various altcoin projects throughout the years, and how bitcoin is the standout survivor. 
According to their data, 91% of the coins that were present for the 2014 cryptocurrency market crash are now entirely abandoned. A large portion of coins that are now dead were created in 2017, with 704 now-dead coins being created that year. The crown for the single most deadly year in cryptocurrency history goes to 2018, during which 751 coins became defunct.

On the other hand, declining dominance suggests the coin is losing steam as not many holders are trading it compared to the rest of the market.

N.Y. Attorney General James believes that the Celsius co-founder and former CEO gave false statements to his customers. Mashinsky allegedly lied about the company’s financial situation and purposely concealed information from his customers.
 
Consequently, Celsius investors lost millions of dollars while the company took “risky investments” with their funds. In the meantime, Mashinsky advertised the platform as being “safer than a bank.” According to the report and the lawsuit:
