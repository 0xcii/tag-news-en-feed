Stake’s Alleged $41 Million Hack
 
The platform which allows users to deposit, bet on sports games, and play games with cryptocurrencies, experienced several unusual transactions which ultimately led to the alleged hack on Monday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has announced that it now accepting Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a payment option through PayPal for Coloradans to renew driver's licenses, identification cards, and vehicle registrations.
“At the DMV, we’re always looking for ways to better serve Coloradans and leverage technology to offer our services,” said Senior Director Electra Bustle. “This new online cryptocurrency payment option is yet another way the DMV is providing innovative and convenient service delivery to our customers.”
Here's how it works: customers just have to select the cryptocurrency payment option, and they will be redirected to PayPal, where they can choose their preferred cryptocurrency to complete the transaction. The selected cryptocurrency is then converted into dollars, covering the total amount due along with applicable fees, before being remitted to the DMV.
However, it's important to note that there is a service fee associated with using cryptocurrency, amounting to $1 plus 1.83% of the total DMV charges. Additionally, PayPal may apply its own fees. As of now, PayPal is the sole cryptocurrency provider accepted for online DMV payments.

There are a large number of problems with drivechains, from the rationale for supporting them, to claims about how they don't affect incentives being inaccurate, and even reasons for why they may actually hurt miner income instead of increasing it. In this piece I'm going to focus solely on the issues regarding incentives for brevity's sake.

Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Surged Back Towards High Levels
 
The “mining hashrate” refers to the total amount of computing power that the miners have attached to the Bitcoin blockchain. This metric can tell us about the interest in mining the asset among these chain validators.
 
If the indicator trends up, it signals that new miners are coming into the blockchain and/or old ones are expanding their facilities, likely because they are finding the network profitable to mine on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After six consecutive days of trading in the red, dogecoin rose higher on Tuesday, after bouncing at a key price floor. The meme coin was a notable gainer in today’s session, despite market sentiment mostly tracking lower. Polygon was also in the green, extending recent gains in the process.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin ended a six-day losing streak on Tuesday, as prices rebounded from a recent point of support.
 
Following a low of $0.06246 on Monday, DOGE/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $0.06422 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move comes as the meme coin surged from a floor at $0.0620, with bulls now likely targeting a ceiling of $0.0680.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the bounce in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose from a floor at 39.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 42.66, with the next point of resistance around 47.00.
 
In the event that this is broken, there is a good chance that DOGE will move back towards $0.07000.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was also trading higher in today’s session, with price climbing for a fourth straight day.
 
MATIC/USD peaked at $0.5634 on Tuesday, which comes following a low of $0.5406 to start the week.
 
As a result of the move, polygon climbed to its strongest point since last Thursday, when the price reached a high of $0.5885.
 
 
Overall, with this current uptrend, it appears that MATIC could be heading towards a key resistance point of $0.6000.
 
In order to get there, the RSI, which is tracking at 40.08, will first need to move past an upcoming ceiling at the 41.00 level.

India took on its G20 presidency in December 2022 and is set to hand over the leadership to Brazil in November this year.
 
Throughout this period, Indian officials, including the finance minister and prime minister, have consistently advocated for the establishment of a common global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and decentralized digital assets. 
 
However, Garg told Hong Kong blockchain news publication Forkast that the situation remains largely unchanged since India assumed the G20 presidency.

How Litecoin Saved Dogecoin
 
Belew tweeted that Dogecoin merged mined with Litecoin in 2014, with the blockchain network ultimately implementing an auxiliary-proof-of-work (AuxPoW) consensus mechanism in the process. 
 
 
Merged mining is when a miner can mine multiple cryptocurrencies on different blockchains. A miner can do this without sacrificing performance and maintaining a high-security level. S it is believed that Belew was referring to Dogecoin being able to tap into Litecoin’s security …]]></summary>

With a long history of contributions to the Bitcoin development conversation, Shinobi will seek to enhance the publication’s ability to elevate ongoing technical discussions at a time when navigating the extensive variety of proposals is more difficult than ever. 
Shinobi has previously received a grant from Bitcoin payments startup Strike, and has served as Technical Advisor to the popular industry podcast What Bitcoin Did. 
“Bitcoin Magazine's decision to bring Shinobi on board as Technical Editor underscores its dedication to providing readers with accurate, timely, and in-depth coverage of the evolving technical landscape of Bitcoin,” said Editor-in-Chief Mark Goodwin. 
Shinobi's work to date has involved exploring privacy solutions such as CoinJoin and other techniques that obfuscate the origin and destination of Bitcoin transactions. Further, his work has shed light on how Bitcoin transactions can be made more private and fungible, crucial qualities for a digital currency aiming to be widely adopted.
“I am very excited and looking forward to the opportunity to help steer the conversation in the community away from memeing and infighting and towards constructive consideration of the many options we have to solve Bitcoin’s engineering challenges,” Shinobi said. 
Overall, Bitcoin Magazine remains committed to maintaining an open platform for discourse on Bitcoin, meaning Shinobi will be tasked with ensuring consistent Editorial standards are applied to all community submissions on a go-forward basis. 
Bitcoin Magazine is open to all contributors interested in joining the Bitcoin discussion, with our editors able to be reached at editors@bitcoinmagzine.]]></summary>

The discourse was ignited by Saul, a prominent figure in the XRP community, who drew an analogy between XRPL and Nokia, suggesting that Xahau might play the role of Apple, potentially overshadowing XRPL in the same way Apple did to Nokia.
 
Ripple CTO Comments On Xahau
 
Schwartz’s response to this analogy was both insightful and comprehensive. He began by drawing parallels to the early days of Bitcoin. “I remember in the early days of bitcoin everyone thought that no cryptocurrency could ever overtake Bitcoin because Bitcoin had first mover advantage and a technical advantage was impossible,” Schwartz remarked.
