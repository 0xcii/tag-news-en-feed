In recent court filings by the U.S. Department of Justice against Avraham Eisenberg, the DoJ refers to two cryptocurrencies as commodities. Eisenberg, who exploited the decentralized finance platform Mango Markets and made $67 million, was arrested yesterday in Puerto Rico and charged with market manipulation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Argo Blockchain, a Bitcoin mining and technology company, has been making desperate attempts to parry the effects of high energy costs and falling BTC prices – both kryptonites to its business.
 
In fact, during the early days of December, the company admitted it is crossing its fingers to avoid filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy by engaging in what it termed as advanced negotiations.
 
On the other end of the negotiating table is an unnamed party Argo Blockchain hopes will support its business as it is dealing with insufficient funding to continue its operations.
 
At that time, among those being considered by the company to make ends meet were selling some of its assets and securing equipment financing to buff its thinning balance sheet and improve its liquidity.

This is an opinion editorial by Shinobi, a self-taught educator in the Bitcoin space and tech-oriented Bitcoin podcast host.
Channel jamming is one of the most threatening outstanding problems with the Lightning Network. It presents an open mechanism to denial-of-service attack nodes on the network to prevent them from routing, losing them money while their liquidity is locked up and unable to forward payments that will earn them fees. An attacker can route a payment through other nodes from themselves to themselves, and refuse to finalize the payment. This makes that liquidity useless for forwarding other payments until the hashed timelock contract (HTLC) timeloc…]]></summary>

As Bitcoinist reported last week, SBF was granted a $250 million bail. When his family posted their house as collateral, the former FTX was allowed to await trial under house arrest. The FTX founder was allegedly involved in a scheme that cost his clients over $8 billion in losses.
 
In that sense, the U.S. court’s leniency and the fact that SBF’s parents supposedly failed to meet the criteria to make bail raised several concerns regarding the legal process. Across social media, users expressed their concerns and distrust about the c…]]></summary>
