Bitcoin Holders Choosing To Hold Their Coins
 
A new report from Santiment has revealed that there are now more Bitcoin long-term holders compared to a year ago. More investors are just now content to hold on to their coins instead of selling at every move and this trend has seen a steady increase since the year began.
 
 
In the graph shared by Santiment, the rate of acceleration over the last couple of months is eerily similar to what was seen from January to April 2021 during the bull market. Traders were more int…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was consolidating in today’s session, following a volatile few days of trading last week. The meme coin rose by nearly 30% last Monday, before losing these gains as the week matured. Shiba inu was largely unchanged. 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) moved marginally higher on Monday, as prices began to settle following recent volatility.
 
Last Monday saw the meme coin jump by nearly 30%, hitting a four-month high in the process.
 
Since then, prices have fallen lower, with the meme coin hitting a bottom of $0.08204 earlier in today’s session.
 
 
DOGE/USD has gone on to reach a peak of $0.08383 on Monday, which came as the relative strength index (RSI) moved closer to a ceiling at 55.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 52.83, which comes after bulls rejected a breakout below a floor at 51.00.
 
Should the RSI move towards the 55.00 mark, there is a good chance that DOGE will be trading above $0.0850.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was largely unchanged to start the week, as the meme coin continued to consolidate on Monday.
 
Following a low of $0.00001085 on Sunday, SHIB/USD rose to a peak of $0.00001099 in today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, SHIB continues to trade below an interim resistance level of $0.00001100.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the price uncertainty comes despite a recent upwards cross between the 10-day (red) moving average, and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the RSI remains below a key ceiling at 50.00, which seems to be another reason for current volatility.
 
In order for bulls to recapture market sentiment, a breakout of these level will need to occur.

Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Hasn’t Yet Reached Its 4-Year MA
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the recovery phase in the asset’s price isn’t over yet. The “Market Value to Realized Value” (MVRV) ratio is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and realized cap.
 
The “realized cap” here refers to a capitalization model for BTC that measures the total cap of the asset by taking the value of each coin in the circulating supply as the price at which it was last moved on the blockchain.
 
This metric aims to find a “fair value” for the cryptocurrency. Since the MVRV ratio compares the market cap (that is, the normal p…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the end of the prolonged XRP lawsuit case with the United States (US) Securities Exchange and Commission (SEC) is still very much uncertain, on April 9, a partner at the law firm of Hogan & Hogan and a lawyer took to his Twitter with a series of tweets to oppose the SEC claims on Ripple.
 
Initiating a lawsuit, this claim on the Ripple company which owns XRP involved that the company has been selling the XRP tokens as “unregulated security.” However, according to the lawyer Jeremy Hogan, XRP is nothing close to “security.”2
 
Why XRP Is Not A Security?
 
With the XRP lawsuit case still ongoing, Hogan was eager to present his opinion backed up with references and details linked to code sections.

This is an opinion editorial by Hannah Wolfman-Jones, author of “System Override: How Bitcoin, Blockchain, Free Speech, & Free Tech Can Change Everything” and founder of We The Web.
Can academia fairly consider Bitcoin?
No. Or at least, not yet.
Academia has a huge and inherent bias against Bitcoin that it has yet to acknowledge. Academics — particularly academic economists — are the central planners who advise and run fiat monetary institutions. As such, they are often blind to the drawbacks of decentralization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week climbing back above $28,000, as markets returned from the Easter holidays. The move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency briefly break out of a key resistance level of $28,500. Ethereum was also higher, as it closed in on the $1,900 level. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was back above $28,000 to start the week, as market sentiment shifted towards the bulls following the Easter break.
 
BTC/USD rose to a high of $28,532.83 earlier in today’s session, after trading at a low of $27,828.48 the day before.
 
As a result of the move, BTC/USD marginally moved past a ceiling at $28,500, however momentum has since shifted.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Initially, today’s rally came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a recent floor at 58.00
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 61.07, with the next visible point of resistance at the 65.00 mark.
 
BTC is trading at $28,327.63 at the time of writing.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also higher on Monday, with prices closing in on the $1,900 level.
 
Following a low of $1,828.78 on Sunday, ETH/USD climbed to a peak of $1,873.06 to start the week.
 
Today’s jump in price came as bulls re-entered the market, after a brief breakout below a floor at $1,830.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Earlier gains have since eased, which comes as a result of the RSI nearing a key resistance point of 62.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is at a reading of 58.83, with the index closing in on a ceiling at 62.00.
 
Should ETH move beyond this point, it is likely that prices will surge above $1,900.
