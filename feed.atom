Neutronpay, a Bitcoin and Lightning company, has announced the release of its mobile app in Canada. According to the company, Neutronpay aims to provide a fast, secure and low-cost solution for cross-border remittances using Lightning.
The app allows users to send and receive Bitcoin and Lightning payments, and it comes with a range of features, including a Lightning Network explorer, QR code scanner and a customizable address book. It also allows users to exchange Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies, such as Canadian dollars, and vice versa.
In addition to the release of the app, Neutronpay has announced its first Canadian partnership with DitoBanx, a Bitcoin and Lightning app in El Salvador. The partnership aims to facilitate cross-border remittances between El Salvadorian-Canadians and their families in El Salvador. Neutronpay's Lightning-powered app will allow Canadians to send and receive money to and from DitoBanx instantly and transparently.
"Cross-border remittances over Lightning are truly keeping more money in the hands of the people who need it the most, all while happening instantly and transparently," Neutronpay said in a statement. "We look forward to supporting El Salvadorians and each new community which comes next for us, so stay tuned!"
El Salvador was the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, and it has been attracting attention from bitcoin companies around the world. According to Neutronpay, Canada has the second largest El Salvadorian community outside the country making it a perfect market for this technology.]]></summary>

This is an opinion editorial by Nozomi Hayase, Ph.D., who has a background in psychology and human development.
On April 15, 2023, Bitcoin Magazine conducted its first-ever Ordinal inscriptions auction, putting its historic covers collection on sale. Some were excited by this new experimentation, which sought to provide buyers with a trust-minimizing experience, while others were not so happy.
David Bailey, the CEO of BTC Inc, the parent company of Bitcoin Magazine, tweeted that the world’s first Bitcoin-only magazine received harsh reaction from the Bitcoin community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
