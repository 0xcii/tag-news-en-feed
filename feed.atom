crypto exchange FTX, may be staring at a "very long sentence" if  
convicted of fraud. The judge overseeing the trial starting next week expressed  
uncertainty about Bankman-Fried's future, suggesting serious consequences. 
The comments by US District Judge Lewis Kaplan came in  
response to a request from the 31-year-old former billionaire, who sought  
temporary release from jail during the trial to facilitate closer coordination  
with his defense team. 
"Flight Risk"
Kaplan denied this request, deeming Bankman-Fried a flight

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, meme coins have been occupying a smaller part of the trader interest in the cryptocurrency sector recently.
 
The relevant indicator here is “social dominance,” but to understand it, the social volume, a metric that it’s based on, must be looked at first. The “social volume” is basically a measure of the amount of discussion around a given coin that users on the major social media platforms are participating in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase has received a regulatory stamp of approval to start offering perpetual futures trading to retail crypto traders outside the U.S., opening up access to the $5.5 trillion global derivatives market.
 
Coinbase Extends Perpetual Futures Trading to Retail Traders Abroad
 
The Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) granted Coinbase International Exchange, the company’s new non-U.S. exchange, a license last week to extend its futures trading services to retail investors across the world, except residents in the U.S. With the approval, Coinbase is poised to expand its derivatives services to more customers globally through its Coinbase Advanced platform in the coming weeks.
 
“As the most trusted and safest name in crypto, Coinbase will operate with maximum transparency, employ a robust risk framework, and meet the high-bar regulatory and compliance standards of the BMA,” the Coinbase announcement said.
 
The company sees regulatory approval as an opportunity to further its mission of updating the global financial system by providing users around the world with more access to regulated derivatives. The announcement discloses that Coinbase will follow rigorous risk management and compliance standards set by Bermuda regulators.
 
 
The move comes as other exchanges face increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States by regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase said its futures contracts have already seen over $5.5 billion in notional trading volume since launching earlier this year.
 
The San Francisco-based company said its futures trading services will only be available to eligible retail investors outside the U.S. after passing the company’s assessment checks. Coinbase said its futures accounts will be backed by usd coin (USDC) reserves and managed by an experienced risk team.

Given Brazil’s significant increase in crypto adoption, the governor emphasized the need to heighten scrutiny on crypto and related activities.
 
Crypto Adoption Increased By 44% 
 
Brazil has witnessed increased adoption amid a high inflation rate. This could be because most people have resorted to digital assets to hedge against inflation and evade tax. Moreover, many believe demand has shifted from fiat currency to stablecoins–cryptocurrencies pegged to USD and other real-world assets.
