        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has announced somewhat of an ambitious plan to hire 1,000 new employees this year, much of which will be driven by efforts to strengthen its compliance efforts.
 
 
Facing rising regulatory scrutiny, especially from the United States, Binance is going to zero in on compliance roles, seeking at least 20% of those new positions to be filled by professionals with a dedicated focus on compliance.
 
Binance Increases Spending On Compliance
 
The urgency to make these hires stems from Binance’s annual spending on compliance, now over $200 million, which has dramatically surged from just a few million a few years ago—quite an investment toward doing things the right way.
 
It’s something the company’s chief executive, Richard Teng—an individua…]]></summary>

Prosecutors Alleged Breach Of Agreement
 
As reported by CNBC, Salame, who previously pleaded guilty to charges related to campaign finance and money-transmitting offenses, has petitioned a New York federal judge to invalidate his guilty plea. 
 
His defense team contends that prosecutors breached a top aspect of the plea agreement by resuming an investigation into his domestic partner, Michelle Bond, for alleged campaign finance violations despite assurances to the contrary.

JUST IN: 🇭🇰 Hong Kong #Bitcoin ETFs saw $15 million in inflows today, the highest in a month.
Slowly and steadily 🙌 pic.twitter.com/Q83tjbS0ML
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 22, 2024
  
  
  
The ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF took in 274 Bitcoin worth around $15 million on August 22nd, its biggest single day of inflows since July 12th. The other two Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs - Bosera Hashkey and Harvest saw no flows today.
Hong Kong approved its first three spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, following the launch of similar products in the U.S. and Europe. The ETFs allow investors to be exposed to Bitcoin prices without having to handle the asset directly.
While Hong Kong's Bitcoin ETF volumes pale compared to those in the U.S., inflows have been steadily climbing. The ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF is the largest of the Hong Kong products, with over $141 million in net assets. Bosera Hashkey and Harvest Bitcoin ETFs have around $99 million and $30 million, respectively, under management.
The total assets under management across the three Hong Kong Spot Bitcoin ETFs is approximately 4,450 BTC worth around $270 million. 
While still modest, the growing inflows indicate increasing bitcoin interest and adoption among Asian institutional investors. As Bitcoin matures into an established asset class, Asian and global investors are seeking regulated exposure through products like spot ETFs.]]></summary>

This comes just a day after Salame made a last-ditch effort to have his conviction vacated or blocked.
 
DOJ Cracks Down On FTX Connections
 
According to the US Attorney’s Office in Manhattan, Bond, who unsuccessfully ran for a congressional seat in New York last year, allegedly used $400,000 from the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, where her partner was an executive, to finance her campaign. 
 
 
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) deemed Bond’s actions a clear violation of laws prohibiting corporate contributions to political campaigns. US Attorney Damian Williams said:

The speculation is rampant about the potential implications for monetary policy and the broader financial landscape.
 
Notably, the Jackson Hole symposium comes on the heels of yesterday’s historic US Bureau of Labour Statistics US job revision. US job additions were revised lower by 818,000, the largest revision since 2009. This major revision underscores a softening labor market—a crucial factor for monetary policy considerations, just as inflation rates began to show signs of abating, with the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropping from 3.9% in December 2023 to 3.2% in July.
