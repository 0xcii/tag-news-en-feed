Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Dived Down Recently
 
As the Bitcoin network works on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, validators called miners have to compete with each other using computing power to get a chance to add the next block to the chain.
 
The total measure of this computing power that’s currently connected to the BTC blockchain is known as the “mining hashrate.” This metric can directly correlate to the security of the network, since if a malicious entity has to succeed in an attack, it has to take over at least 51% of the total computing power.

This strategic decision marks a pivotal juncture in El Salvador's Bitcoin journey since the introduction of the Bitcoin Law, which has drawn both admiration and skepticism worldwide.
Amidst a cacophony of critiques ranging from allegations of human rights violations to inadequate modern infrastructure, El Salvador has stood committed, weathering storms of disapproval from traditional finance stalwarts and even fervent Bitcoin maximalists on Twitter (X) Spaces.

The HSM server has introduced functionality to support atomically swapping two statechains, as well as enforcing an atomic exchange of a statechain for a Lightning payment. This is the first example of concretely defined and built interactions between statechains and the Lightning Network. Synergy between both protocols has been postulated since the concept of a statechain was originally proposed by Ruben Somsen, specifically as a way to solve the limitation of having to transfer a whole statechain UTXO at once.

This has also led to a massive rebound for SHIB’s price, which suffered a sharp correction in the past week due to a wave of profit-taking.
 
Shiba Inu Burns Increase By Over 2,300%
 
According to Shiba Inu’s burn tracker, Shibburn, SHIB’s burn rate increased by over 2,300% in the last 24 hours, with 195 million SHIB tokens burned during this period. This development has also provided a much-needed recovery to the meme coin’s price, which declined by over 18% last week. 
 
 
SHIB has been on the rise in the past few weeks, even climbing to the number 10 spot of largest crypto tokens by market cap. However, its run was halted last week by a wave of profit-taking f…]]></summary>

        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e74ca3a7ec7</id>
        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/150000-standard-chartered-bitcoin-price-forecast-2024"/>
        <updated>2024-03-18T14:27:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Global banking giant Standard Chartered has upped its bitcoin price prediction for the end of 2024 to $150,000, a significant increase from its previous forecast of $100,000.
In a new report, Standard Chartered analysts cited strong inflows into recently launched spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. as a primary driver of their bullish outlook. The bank believes these "sticky" institutional flows will continue propelling Bitcoin's price.
Standard Chartered has emerged as one of the more Bitcoin-friendly legacy banks, with an active research team covering Bitcoin. Previously, the bank's analysts had predicted Bitcoin would reach $100,000 by the end of 2024.
But with Bitcoin's strong performance in early 2024, the team is now forecasting that it will hit $150,000 within the next nine months. 
Standard Chartered Bank analysts led by Geoffrey Kendrick wrote: "For 2024, given the sharper-than-expected price gains year-to-date, we now see potential for the price to reach the $150,000 level by year-end, up from our previous estimate of $100,000."
They expect the rally to continue into 2025, with Bitcoin potentially trading as high as $250,000 next year before settling around $200,000.
The updated price prediction comes as spot bitcoin ETFs got approved in the US earlier this year. Standard Chartered believes these regulated investment vehicles are bringing significant institutional demand.
Combined with Bitcoin's fixed supply and other positive fundamentals, the bank sees room for substantial additional upside. Based on increasing mainstream adoption, Standard Chartered expects new highs.
Their bold call illustrates a growing willingness among major financial institutions to make ambitious bitcoin price forecasts. If achieved, a climb to $150,000 would mark a 120% gain from current levels near $68,000. For Standard Chartered, bitcoin's status as "digital gold" continues to strengthen.]]></summary>
