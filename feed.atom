Bitcoin NUPL Has Been At Overheated Levels For Weeks Now
 
In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about a bearish development that has recently occurred in the Bitcoin “Net Unrealized Profit/Loss” (NUPL) indicator.
 
As its name already suggests, the NUPL keeps track of the net amount of unrealized profit or loss that the investors of the cryptocurrency as a whole are holding right now. This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each token in circulation to see what price it was last moved at.
 
 
With the assumption that the previous transfer for any coin was the last point it changed hands, the metric subtracts the price at its …]]></summary>

One such solution is a hardware wallet, a physical device that allows you to securely hold the keys to your bitcoin. But hardware wallets aren’t the only option for storing your bitcoin keys—there are also software wallets, paper wallets, and even “brain wallets.” So why specifically choose a hardware wallet?
1. Keep your keys offline, protected from remote attacks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Palladium and Botanix Labs have announced the launch of a new stablecoin, PUSD, on Bitcoin's first EVM-equivalent Layer 2 network, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.
The PUSD stablecoin, developed by Palladium Labs, boasts a unique feature of being over-collateralized by 110%, a strategic measure aimed at enhancing its resilience against potential risks inherent in DeFi infrastructure. Importantly, the stablecoin's algorithmic monetary policy attempts to remain immune to governance changes or manipulation by administrator keys, aiming to ensure its integrity and reliability.
“To realize the true value of decentralized finance, crypto needs to break free from infrastructure that is susceptible to exploits and manipulation,” stated Palladium Labs CEO Akash Gaurav. “At Palladium, we designed this stablecoin for resilience and reliability. By leveraging the unique capabilities of the Botanix EVM, we can radically increase the security and reliability of stablecoin access for millions of people using Bitcoin.”
Operating on the Botanix EVM, which has been in development since early 2023, Palladium leverages the capabilities of this platform to enhance the security and accessibility of stablecoin transactions for Bitcoin users. The Botanix EVM's underlying sidechain protocol, known as the Spiderchain, plays a pivotal role in safeguarding funds transferred from the Bitcoin base layer to the EVM network.
“The importance of native stablecoins to the technological renaissance happening on Bitcoin cannot be overstated,” said Willem Schroe, inventor of the Spiderchain and co-founder of Botanix Labs. “We are thrilled to support the Palladium team in launching their over-collateralized stablecoin on our EVM network.”
With the launch of PUSD on Bitcoin's first EVM Layer 2 network, Palladium and Botanix Labs aim to meet the growing demand for secure and efficient DeFi solutions, seeking to pave the way for a new era of financial innovation on the Bitcoin blockchain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MicroStrategy has continued expanding its bitcoin holdings, announcing the purchase of approximately 9,245 bitcoins for around $623 million in cash today.
According to the company's new press release, it acquired the bitcoin between March 11 and 18, using proceeds from its recent convertible senior notes offering and excess company cash. The average purchase price was approximately $67,382 per bitcoin.
This latest acquisition comes just after MicroStrategy raised $603.75 million through a private offering of 0.875% convertible senior notes due in 2031. The company upsized the planned offering from $500 million after seeing strong demand.
With the new 9,245 BTC purchase, MicroStrategy now holds an aggregate total of approximately 214,246 bitcoins acquired at an average price of $35,160 per bitcoin. The company has spent $7.53 billion to accumulate its Bitcoin treasury reserves.
Led by CEO Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy continues to aggressively execute its bitcoin strategy even amid Bitcoin market volatility. 
The company aims to hold Bitcoin as its primary corporate treasury asset, taking on debt and issuing equity to raise funds for further accumulation. MicroStrategy now own more than 1% of Bitcoin total supply.
While sceptics argue that bitcoin-backed loans introduce balance sheet risk, Saylor remains staunchly confident in bitcoin's long-term trajectory. With its latest buy enabled by the upsized note offering, MicroStrategy is doubling down on its Bitcoin play.]]></summary>
