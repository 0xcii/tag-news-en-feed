On the other hand, Mayhew claims the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as event tickets allows buyers in the secondary market “to easily verify if the ticket is actually valid and owned by the seller.” For Mayhew, that is how the blockchain and smart contracts in particular “can help eliminate two of the biggest symptoms of the troubled event economy.…]]></summary>

Laser Digital’s Bitcoin Adoption Fund
 
Nomura’s digital assets subsidiary, Laser Digital, announced the launch of its Bitcoin Adoption Fund on Tuesday. Nomura Group is Japan’s largest investment bank and brokerage group.
 
The announcement explains that Bitcoin Adoption Fund will be the first in a range of digital adoption investment solutions that Laser Digital Asset Management will bring to the market. Laser Digital emphasized:
 

The Laser Digital Bitcoin Adoption Fund provides long-only exposure to bitcoin whilst being one of the most cost-effective and secure investment solutions.
 
“To secure the fund’s assets, Laser will use Komainu, which was founded in 2018 by Nomura, Ledger, and Coinshares and delivers a regulated custody solution for institutional digital asset investors,” the announcement adds.
 
Headquartered in Switzerland, Laser Digital was formally launched by Nomura in September last year. The company explained at the time that it will focus on three core areas, namely “Secondary Trading, Venture Capital, and Investor Products.”
 
 
Commenting on the launch of Bitcoin Adoption Fund, Sebastien Guglietta, head of Laser Digital Asset Management, said:
 

Bitcoin is one of the enablers of this long-lasting transformational change and long-term exposure to bitcoin offers a solution to investors to capture this macro trend.
 
“We’re delighted to now launch our Bitcoin Adoption Fund, which allows institutional investors a secure path into digital asset investment that is backed by established finance, with the highest levels of risk management and compliance,” said Fiona King, Laser Digital Asset Management’s head of distribution.
