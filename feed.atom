The entrepreneur, who was the founder of the Suriname Palace Casino, an establishment he co-owned with CCA Companies Incorporated (Conserver Corporation of America), was shot two times in the chest and once in the neck in a drive-by shooting, resulting in his death at the age of 36.
Preceding the shooting, Parbhoe had blown the whistle about how millions of dollars were being siphoned out of his business’ bank account at De Surinaamsche Bank (DSB), the largest bank in the country aside from the country’s central bank.
He had gone to the head of the DSB, the Central Bank of Suriname, the country’s Foreign Exchange Commission, the Minister of Justice (the current President of Suriname) and even the CIA to report that his funds w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) has announced, in a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, that her re-election campaign now accepts cryptocurrency donations. This move comes as Blackburn's campaign recently launched a page dedicated to Bitcoin donations.
“Our campaign is committed to meeting supporters where they are,” said Senator Blackburn. “As a growing number of Americans utilize digital currencies for everyday transactions, we are excited to take this next step and stay on the cutting edge of the 21st-century digital world.”
This announcement follows a recent trend of Bitcoin adoption among U.S. politicians. Just yesterday, Blackburn chaired the RNC Platform Committee that passed their 2024 platform draft, committing to defend the right to mine and self-custody Bitcoin. Congressman Matt Gaetz recently introduced a bill allowing federal income tax payments in Bitcoin. Additionally, former President Donald Trump also started accepting Bitcoin Lightning payments for campaign donations.
Earlier this year, Senator Blackburn told Bitcoin Magazine that the freedom and privacy aspects of Bitcoin are a "very good thing", while advocating strongly against central bank digital currencies (CBDC), saying they are spy tools for the government to use against their citizens.

Senator Blackburn is also set to speak at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville at the end of the month, further signaling her support for Bitcoin.

Why Mt Gox’s 47,000 BTC Move Won’t Affect Bitcoin’s Price
 
In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Ki Young Ju outlined three possible scenarios for Mt Gox’s Bitcoin transactions to explain why it won’t affect its price.
