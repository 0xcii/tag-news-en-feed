        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin has had quite a few days of intriguing price action coupled with intense volatility. Notably, Dogecoin, which ended the last days of September on a bullish run, has since reversed those gains and is back where it left off just above $0.10. 
 
According to a technical analysis of the Dogecoin price action, the meme coin broke above a multi-month downtrend last week. However, as it stands, a recent correction in the past 48 hours has seen DOGE reversing to retest the breakout point. As noted by a crypto analyst, this retest is crucial to DOGE’s performance in the coming weeks and months. A bounce or a break below could make or break the meme coin’s price.
