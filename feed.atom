        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-sellers-scupper-rebound-as-ltc-remains-near-3-week-low/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-20T15:39:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin rebounded from Wednesday’s drop, with the meme coin briefly climbing back above $0.090 in today’s session. However as the day progressed, bearish sentiment heightened, with price declining. Litecoin was also down today, and continues to trade near a multi-week low.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was volatile on Thursday, as prices moved back into the red, after an earlier rebound.
 
DOGE/USD fell to an intraday low of $0.08685 in today’s session, following an earlier high of $0.09297.
 
The meme coin has been volatile in recent sessions, after a week-long bull run was snapped on Wednesday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s candlestick has printed a large doji, with dogecoin now trading close to its open price.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) has found a floor at the 53.00 mark, which has helped maintain the uncertainty.
 
Should this floor give way, there is a good chance that DOGE will move towards a support point at $0.08000.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) traded near a three-week low in today’s session, as the token moved below $100.00.
 
Following a high of $101.95 on Wednesday, LTC/USD plunged to a low of $89.38 earlier today.
 
This is the lowest level that litecoin has hit since March 31, with bears now potentially targeting a long-term floor at $86.00.
 
 
As a result of today’s decline, the RSI has fallen to a point of support of its own at the 45.00 mark.
 
If price strength were to fall below this point, it is likely that LTC could head closer to $80.00.

Now, the country’s central bank is reportedly planning to establish new organizations to mine crypto assets and settle foreign payments, as reported by the local media.
 
Officials at the country’s central bank were cited this week by the state news agency TASS as saying that they were working on experimental legislation that would allow the usage of cryptocurrencies in export-import negotiations.
