However, the Bitcoin Mining Council, initiated by Michael Saylor, tries to disprove that this is only half the truth with its quarterly reports.
 
Bitcoin is powered by almost 60% green energy. But even on a small scale, BTC mining can do big wonders, according to a new report from MIT Technology Review that was shared by Saylor via Twitter.
 
Virunga National Park is the first national park in the world to recognize the potential of Bitcoin mining, supporting nature, the park’s endangered mountain gorillas, and the resident community.
 
As the report discusses, the Bitcoin mine is powered by the giant hydroelectric plant on the same mountain that makes the national …]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-eth-consolidate-following-recent-highs/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-16T13:34:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated on Jan. 16, as U.S. markets closed in celebration of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday celebration. Traders have seemingly moved to secure recent gains, after the world’s largest cryptocurrency rose above $21,000 for the first time since November. Ethereum also retreated from recent highs in today’s session. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated to start the week, as prices failed to break out of a key resistance level.
 
Following a high of $21,345.25 on Sunday, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $20,681.98 earlier in today’s session.
 
This drop comes as the world’s largest cryptocurrency was unable to move beyond its long-term ceiling at $21,400.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this was somewhat expected, due to the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovering in overbought territory.
 
As of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 86.65, after failing to move north of the 90.00 mark.
 
It is likely that further declines could be on the cards this week, with a floor of $20,000 a potential target for sellers.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also retreated from recent highs, which comes after a failed breakout of its own.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,529.79 earlier today, which comes after trading at a high of $1,579.48 on Sunday.
 
Ethereum failed to sustain a move above a ceiling at $1,580, giving way to a resurgence of some bearish sentiment.
 
 
Like with bitcoin, ethereum prices were significantly overbought, with the index at its highest point since January 2021.
 
Now tracking at 83.46, the next visible floor seems to be at the 70.00 mark, which if hit, could see ETH trading near $1,475.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea’s supreme court has upheld the ruling for Bithumb, the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, to pay damages to more than a hundred customers who filed a lawsuit claiming they suffered financial losses resulting from the exchange’s service outage.
 
Bithumb Ordered to Pay Customers Over Service Outage
 

 
The South Korean supreme court has issued a final ruling in a case involving a service outage at Bithumb, the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Yonhap reported.
 

 
The court has ordered Bithumb to pay damages totaling 251.4 million won ($203,120) to 132 investors who filed a lawsuit against the crypto exchange operator following the service outage, officials said Friday.
 

 
The plaintiffs claimed that they suffered financial losses due to steep price drops in a number of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin cash (BCH) and ethereum classic (ETC), on Nov. 12, 2017, when the service outage occurred. According to the lawsuit, during the service interruption, the average number of orders per hour doubled, causing transaction flows to significantly slow down.
 

 

 

 

 

 
A district court initially ruled in favor of Bithumb against the investors. However, the decision was subsequently overturned by an appellate court, which ordered Bithumb to pay damages ranging from 8,000 won to 8 million won to each of the 132 investors. The supreme court upheld this ruling Thursday.
 

 
According to the appellate court:
 

The burden or the cost of technological failures should be shouldered by the service operator, not service users who pay commission for the service.
