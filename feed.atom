        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bad news for Ripple and XRP? The U.S crypto regulation landscape, already mired in uncertainty, has been thrown into further turmoil yesterday following diverging judicial opinions about the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities. However, Ripple Labs’ Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty has held firm, insisting that a recent controversial ruling against Terraform Labs has no bearing on the Ripple case.

Brandt claimed that while the top cryptocurrency’s correlation to other markets is a non-starter, bitcoin’s position on “top of [the] food chain” is the only thing that matters.
 
Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval ‘Inevitable’
 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt has said the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event is likely to be a non-event because “markets discount in advance.” In his July 27 tweet, Brandt said he believes the “inevitable OK of a $BTC ETF [exchange traded fund] in the U.S. will be [a] non-event.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decentralized exchange (DEX) LeetSwap, a protocol native to Coinbase’s Base network, has halted its operations due to fears of a possible exploit. This follows reports that about 30 meme coins were recently rug-pulled on the Base network. 
 
BALD, a meme token inspired by the Coinbase CEO, is the most notable of the rugged coins. According to on-chain data, the project’s developer removed 6,800 ETH ($12.5 million) from the liquidity pool on LeetSwap, causing an 85% nosedive in price.

The BALD memecoin, humorously named after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, launched on July 30 and took off on an unbelievable 290,000% gain within its first 24 hours. However, it wasn’t long before the euphoria turned sour as the anonymous deployer of BALD withdrew 10,705 ETH ($20 million) and 224.6 million BALD from liquidity, causing the token’s price to plummet by over 90%. Despite allegations of a ‘rug pull’, the deployer denied these accusations.
