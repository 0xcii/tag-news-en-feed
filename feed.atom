SBF Lawyers Into The Loan’s Legalities
 
Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the now-defunct FTX exchange, seems to be in a tangle over the loans given out by Alameda Research. Lawyers on his team are eager to question Gary Wang about the details and the legal counsels involved in the loans he received from the trading firm.
 
 
Last week, during the trial, the prosecutors delved deep into Wang’s financial activities. They pointedly asked about what they described as “a series of personal loans” that ranged from roughly $200-$300 million.

Amid the chaos, the spotlight turned to Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, as the last remaining tycoon in the crypto world after the swift fall of Sam Bankman-Fried. 
 
With a grand vision to rescue struggling startups, Zhao rallied industry leaders to raise a minimum of $1 billion. However, according to Bloomberg, the Industry Recovery Initiative (IRI) fell short of expectations nearly a year later, leaving the crypto market starved for cash and companies on the brink of collapse.

The upheaval has been marked by financial struggles at major companies and notable leadership changes that are raising questions about the stability and future of the digital currency market.

One of the most alarming indicators of the current turmoil is the recent decision by Bitmain, a prominent Bitcoin application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) manufacturer, to suspend employee salary payments for September and beyond. 
 
This news comes as a significant blow to the morale of Bitmain’s workforce, which has also had to contend with the elimination of bonuses and incentives.

Before we get

Among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, opinions on CBDCs vary widely, ranging from viewing them as powerful tools for government surveillance and control to seeing them as desperate attempts by traditional fiat systems to maintain relevance. In this essay, we will explore the assertion that CBDCs are unlikely to attain widespread adoption, while bitcoin is poised to emerge as the dominant digital currency. Three pivotal factors support this argument: Bitcoin's open and permissionless nature, its first-mover advantage, and its user-centric monetary policy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone has heard about the 4-year cycle that Bitcoin is going through, but have you ever thought of the idea that Bitcoin might be going through a bigger cycle?
