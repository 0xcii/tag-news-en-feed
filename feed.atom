        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese billionaire Jack Ma recently agreed to give up control of Ant Group as part of changes to the fintech’s corporate structure, which will supposedly not have an impact on “the economic interests of any shareholders of Ant Group and their beneficiaries.” Once the process is complete, no single shareholder will have control over Ant Group, the fintech said in a statement.

Billionaire and Chinese fintech giant Ant Group’s controlling shareholder, Jack Ma, recently agreed to an arrangement that dilutes his shareholding and his voting rights. As a result of these changes, Ma, who directly and indirectly controlled more than 50% of Ant Group, will see this influence whittled down to just 6%.

For Grayscale, however, the current battle is also about continuing to fight on the front lines against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Craig Salm, chief legal officer (CLO) at Grayscale, revealed in a Twitter thread today that Grayscale will “soon” file the next brief in its lawsuit against the SEC, which is refusing to convert Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF.

The legislative framework for a Bitcoin-backed bond, known as the “Volcano Bond,” will be used to reduce government debt and support the establishment of a planned “Bitcoin City” in the country.
 
The National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador (ONBTC) tweeted the news on January 11, stating that the law had been passed on Thursday.
 
Exactly one year after the unveiling of the plan, El Salvador’s Minister of the Economy Maria Luisa Hayem Brevé proposed the measure as the next step towards achieving this goal.
 
The nation is now a significant step closer to bringing the crypto bonds into existence as a result of the approval.

As Bitcoinist reported yesterday, they have managed to recover around $5 billion in liquid assets. “We have located over $5 billion of cash, liquid cryptocurrency and liquid investment securities,” Andy Dietderich, an attorney for FTX said Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.
 
Massive Crypto Dump Coming?
 
What may have been even more noteworthy was Dietderich’s statement that FTX plans to dump non-strategic holdings with a book value of $4.6 billion, which could lead to tremendous selling pressure in the crypto market.
