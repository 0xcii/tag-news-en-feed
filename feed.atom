        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a tweet this week, crypto advocate Nic Carter took aim at those who claim to be bitcoin enthusiasts but have been applauding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement actions. Carter accused these individuals of turning Bitcoin into a “secular cult” and argued that the “vast majority” of them are actually newcomers to the cryptocurrency space. His criticism highlights the growing divide within the Bitcoin community between those who prioritize decentralization and those who welcome regulatory oversight.
