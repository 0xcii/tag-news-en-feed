Bitcoin Whale Rises From Hibernation
 
One such whale recently emerged from the depths, a digital leviathan that hadn’t breached the surface for nearly 12 years. This behemoth, with a treasure trove of 500 BTCs initially acquired in 2012 for a measly $4,000, has transferred its entire stash, now valued at a staggering $35 million, to multiple new addresses. The resurfacing of this whale, and others like it, has cast a long shadow over th…]]></summary>

On Friday, March 29, the Prisma Finance hacker transferred some of the proceeds from the theft to crypto mixer Tornado Cash in multiple transactions. According to PeckShield, $2.7 million in ETH was moved in one transaction and $3.8 million in another.
 
What’s most interesting is the hacker sent an on-chain message barely six hours after the attack through one of the addresses linked to the heist, claiming they are a “white hat hacker.” And the exploiter has continued to send on-chain messages to Prisma Finance’s team since the theft occurred.

Worldcoin’s system hinges on a unique approach. Instead of traditional signup methods like name and address, users submit iris scans to create a digital ID.
 
This anonymity is incentivized by offering free WLD cryptocurrency tokens. The program has garnered over 4.6 million users globally, but concerns about data privacy have dogged it from the start.

CryptoQuant, a prominent on-chain data analytics firm, recently revealed a staggering increase in Bitcoin demand. Over the past month, monthly demand skyrocketed from 40,000 BTC to a whopping 213,000 BTC. This meteoric rise is attributed to a perfect storm of factors, including the launch of new Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and aggressive accumulation by high net worth investors, often referred to as “whales.”
