If it wasn‚Äôt clear already following the slew of new protocols birthed by the Ordinals‚Äô movement, the release of Lightning Labs‚Äô Lightning-native Taproot Assets protocol feels like a consecration to the phenomenon. 
More than two years after the protocol was originally announced, users and developers can now open channels denominated in a unit of account of their choice and leverage the existing Lightning Network infrastructure. Though Taproot Assets was leapfrogged in its effort to bring assets to Bitcoin by more naive protocols such as BRC-20 or Runes, patience has been rewarded as advocates of the protocol contend it is superior in all aspects, from scalability to security.

The betting odds presently, however, point just to a 26% possibility of such a declaration by July 28. Reflecting a major change in market mood, this stands a sharp contrast to the 76% likelihood originally attributed to the concept.
