Part of these secrets include the alleged illegalities that went on in FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research. 
 
FTX Offered To Pay Whistleblower $5 Million
 
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), FTX had offered to pay $5 million to LedgerX Chief Risk Officer Julie Schoening, whose team is reported to have discovered the backdoor that allowed Sam Bankman-Fried to siphon funds from the crypto exchange to Alameda Research.
 
 
However, that deal for the $5 million settlement never materialized, as WSJ reported that the paperwork wasn’t completed before FTX collapsed in November. Schoening is believed to have been off…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, 19 distinct bitcoin addresses from 2012 awakened, moving coins that had remained untouched for over 11 years. Fast forward to this month, and we’ve already seen four such transfers from 2012. This Sunday, at block heights 811,239 and 811,244, two addresses from that vintage year collectively transacted 227 BTC, a sum equivalent to $6.34 million using current bitcoin exchange rates.
 
Sleeping Giant Awakens With $6 Million Bitcoin Move After 11 Years
 
The trend of transferring old bitcoins persists in October 2023, following an intriguing set of transactions on October 4 and 6. On these dates, 86 addresses from 2014 transferred 860 bitcoins, an address from 2013 shifted 504.99 bitcoins, and two addresses from 2012 moved a combined 426 BTC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum plunged below the $1,600 level to start the week, as global markets reacted to the escalating tensions in the Middle East. Crude oil prices rallied from a six-week low, climbing by over 4% overnight. Bitcoin gave up recent gains, as traders fled to more traditional safe-haven assets.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) slipped for a second straight session on Monday, with traders retreating from high-risk assets, as tensions in the Middle East escalated.
 
Following a peak of $27,999.55 on Sunday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,445.89 earlier in the day.
 
Overall, bitcoin has been edging lower since Friday, after bulls failed to orchestrate a break out above a ceiling at $28,300.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Looking at the chart, it now appears that momentum has shifted bearish, with bitcoin heading for a support point at $27,000.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has also been on the decline, moving away from its resistance of 60.00, and is now tracking at 54.35
 
A target of 45.00 on the RSI will likely need to be hit, if bears are to push BTC below the $27,000 level in the coming days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) suffered heavy losses to start the week, with the price falling under the $1,600 zone.
 
ETH/USD moved to a bottom at $1,590.34 earlier in today’s session, which came a day after peaking at $1,638.90.
 
Overall, it appears that sellers are looking to push the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency to a floor at $1,560, before possibly taking profits.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Ethereum is now trading at a two-week low, with the RSI also hovering around its weakest point since late-September.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 41.65, after recently slipping below a point of support at the 43.00 level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gary Wang, the enigmatic co-founder and chief technology officer of the defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, provided an incriminating testimony during the ongoing criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, marking the trial’s third day.
 
Wang revealed in a shocking new statement that FTX’s purported $100 million insurance fund for 2021 was a fabrication and never held any of the exchanges’ FTX tokens (FTT) as stated.
 
Wang’s testimony is consistent with the views held by the cryptocurrency community, which has discovered proof of software code allegedly used by FTX to manipulate its insurance fund and deceive the public about its true values.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Pavel Salas, the chief growth officer at Gear Foundation, on-chain smart contract automation makes applications “truly decentralized” because it “removes dependencies on centralized servers or external entities.” Salas also claimed that on-chain smart contract automation means participants can “engage in transactions or exchanges without relying on a central authority.”
 
Webassembly Not a ‘Direct Replacement for EVM’
 
In his written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, Salas argued that on-chain smart contract automation also helps decentralized applications (dapps) maintain data integrity without having to rely on external databases. He said since the code of smart contracts deployed on the blockchain is immutable this means it cannot be altered once deployed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, one of the world's largest Bitcoin and crypto exchanges, has expressed his belief that the next Bitcoin halving, scheduled for 2024, could usher in a period of renewed price growth.
Bitcoin halvings, which occur approximately every four years, are pivotal events in the cryptocurrency's history. During these events, the rate at which new Bitcoin is created through mining is reduced, resulting in a reduction in the asset's issuance.
As alluded by Zhao, this supply shock has historically had a significant impact on the price of Bitcoin, resulting in all-time highs in 2013, 2017, and 2021.
Zhao's remarks on the potential for "all-time highs" following the 2024 Bitcoin halving are grounded in historical trends. Over the past three halvings, Bitcoin has experi…]]></summary>

On August 29, 2023, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled in favor of Grayscale regarding its proposal to convert the Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into the first exchange-traded Bitcoin fund. The court deemed the SEC’s denial as “arbitrary and capricious” due to inconsistency with futures-based BTC products.
