Thorn noted that while a Trump victory would undoubtedly be more favorable for the broader crypto industry, a Harris win could still offer better support than the current Biden regime. He described the downside risk of a Harris presidency as ‘limited.’

Bitcoin Has Enjoyed Sharp Bullish Momentum Recently
 
Bitcoin has kicked off the new week on a positive note as its price has surged around 4% to return to the same highs as back at the end of last month. The below chart shows how the cryptocurrency’s recent trajectory has looked.
 

 
 
At the peak of this latest rally, Bitcoin had briefly touched the $66,500 mark, but since then, the coin has suffered a pullback, although the degree of it isn’t too significant as the price is still trading around $65,500.
 
 
The recent surge of the asset would naturally have had an effect on the profitability of the investors, which on-chain data has confirmed.
