        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase  
Derivatives Exchange, a futures exchange licensed by the U.S. Commodity Futures  
Trading Commission (CFTC), has announced the availability of its crypto futures  
products on the Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT) platform. 
Trading  
Technologies and Coinbase Derivatives Join Forces
This  
integration allows TT customers, including institutional and professional  
traders, to directly trade regulated cryptocurrency futures from the TT  
platform.
Randy  
Myers, Head of Crypto at Trading Technologies, expressed enthusiasm about  
providing access to Coinbase Derivatives Exchange through the TT platform,  
offering traders market-leading tools such as Autospreader, ADL, and  
Aggregator.
The  
collaboration between Coinbase Derivatives Exchange and Trading Technologies  
aims to enhance the digital asset derivatives trading landscape, providing  
users with a seamless experience. This partnership aligns with Coinbase  
Institutional's goal of expanding institutional access and adoption of digital  
asset derivatives.
Traders,  
hedgers, and brokers using TT now have access to both "Nano"-sized  
Bitcoin and Ether futures (1/100th BTC and 1/10th ETH) and institutional-sized  
futures (1 BTC and 10 ETH).
"Trading  
Technologies is a key partner for facilitating institutional access to and the  
continued growth of our suite of crypto futures products," said Boris  
Ilevsky, Head of Coinbase Derivatives Exchange. "Coupled with increasing  
support from the FCM community, this collaboration marks a major milestone for  
institutional demand and adoption of CFTC regulated crypto derivatives.”
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Lightning Labs mainnet Alpha launch last month was big news. Up till now Ethereum and Tron dominated smart contracts. Now with this latest protocol Bitcoin is poised to challenge their dominance and bring new vigor to the network. This new feature will equip developers with the tools needed to make Bitcoin a multi-asset network, enabling users to hold real-world assets like gold on the Bitcoin blockchain, marking a critical moment for Bitcoin’s evolution.
But Lightning's Taproot Assets have even wider consequences than what they initially received hype for. With the next bull run warming up on the sidelines, the demand for diverse us…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, Montenegro’s appeals court overturned the extradition request for Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon. This reversal follows reports that Justice Minister Andrej Milovic had informally agreed to the extradition.
 
Kwon to Remain in Montenegro, Decision Lies With Justice Minister
 
For the time being, Kwon is set to stay in Montenegro, as the Appeals Court Council, on Dec. 14, overturned the Higher Court in Podgorica’s decision to extradite him to the United States. The case has now been remanded to the lower court for a fresh evaluation and ruling.
 
The court’s decision to halt Kwon’s extradition was invalidated due to a violation of specific legal protocols as per the Montenegrin Criminal Procedure Code. Notably, the court exceeded its jurisdiction. In Montenegro, a court’s function in extradition matters is merely to verify the legal grounds for such a request.
 
However, the power to actually suspend or defer the extradition of the ex-CEO of Terraform Labs is not within the court’s remit. This responsibility is solely vested in the Minister of Justice, following the Montenegrin legislation on international legal assistance in criminal matters. Here, the appeals court made a decision beyond its legal capacity, necessitating the annulment.
 
 
Confronting significant legal challenges from both the U.S. and South Korea, Kwon has unwaveringly refuted all allegations of fraud. His charges, filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and South Korean financial authorities, include commodities fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit fraud and manipulate the market. The ultimate decision to approve or deny Kwon’s extradition lies with the Justice Minister.

The reason for this unusual increase in transaction costs is that Ordinals inscriptions are becoming more and more common in the blockchain network.
 
Bitcoin Network Activity Soars, And So Do Fees
 
The need to handle transactions on the Bitcoin network has increased significantly as the Ordinals inscriptions become more visible.
 
Due to the significant increase in transaction fees brought about by this spike in demand, mining has become a profitable industry for all parties involved.

NitroBetting.eu, a prominent Bitcoin-exclusive sportsbook, just released the first-of-their-kind Bitcoin Spot ETF betting lines. The new prediction market is focused on the SEC’s potential Spot ETF approval date, as well as speculation on which ETF sponsor will be the first to receive approval. According to the published odds, the market thinks it more likely than not that the SEC approves a Spot BTC ETF by 1/10/2024, with odds sitting at -1667 for, and +650 against.
With regard to ETF sponsors, at the time of writing, simultaneous approval for multiple applicants is the most favored scenario (-250), with Blackrock leading the pack as most favored for standalone approval (+120).

This wasn’t surprising though, as most cryptocurrencies went through a brief period of consolidation and profit-taking last week. 
 
According to the latest report from CoinShares, digital asset investment products saw minor outflows of $16 million last week, with the majority of the outflows coming from Bitcoin. However, despite the outflows, Solana picked up steam, with its net inflow jumping 240% percent from the previous week.
