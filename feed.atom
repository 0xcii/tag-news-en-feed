NFT heists, a new frontier has emerged: one that encompasses insider jobs,

According to the data  
recently released by Comparitech, the influx of stolen funds dwindled in 2023,  
signaling a potential reduction in cybercriminal activities. Despite this, the  
cumulative sum of stolen funds continues to rise. However, it is lower compared  
to 2022, which witnessed an unprecedented wave of crypto heists, with hackers  
pocketing over USD $3.5 billion in ill-gotten gains.
