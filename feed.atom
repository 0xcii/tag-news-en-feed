        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brian Korn, a partner at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips LLP, a Los Angeles-based law firm of more than 450 attorneys, has introduced a thought-provoking argument regarding the legal battle between SEC v. Ripple that could have far-reaching consequences for the broader crypto industry’s secondary market.
 
The ruling, which was rendered on July 13, carried some intriguing implications for the entire crypto market. While Judge Torres explicitly said in a footnote that she is not addressing whether all secondary trading in XRP is covered by federal securities law because that question was not presented in the SEC’s case, she classified institutional XRP sales as investment contracts and excluded programmatic sales from this category.

ECB Boosts Interest Rates Amid Inflation Woes
 
The European Central Bank’s (ECB) Governing Council announced that it has raised three key ECB interest rates by 25bps on Thursday. The ECB’s move follows the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking the federal funds rate by 25bps the day prior. Similarly to the Fed’s decision, the ECB members of the Governing Council insisted that the bank looks to get annual inflation down to its 2% target.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana was once again in the green, with bulls pushing the token towards a key resistance level at $26.00. The move comes after yesterday’s 7% surge, however earlier gains have since declined, as U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew 2.4% as opposed to the 1.8% expectation for Q2. Polygon also climbed higher today, bouncing from a support level around $0.7000.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) moved closer to a long-term resistance level of $26.00 on Thursday, as sentiment in the token remained bullish.
 
Following a low of $24.45 on Wednesday, SOL/USD surged to an intraday high of $25.59 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, solana climbed to its highest point since last Saturday, when price peaked at $25.97.
 
 
One of the reasons behind today’s rally appears to be a breakout which took place at a ceiling of 59.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 59.90, with SOL bulls giving up some of their earlier gains.
 
Despite climbing by nearly 10% in the past two days, the token is down by 2.80% in the past week, following a recent bear run.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) bounced from a recent support point earlier in today’s session, as bulls rejected an extended sell-off.
 
MATIC/USD peaked at $0.7347 on Thursday, a day after falling to a bottom at the $0.7124 mark.
 
The initial move came as the world’s 11th largest cryptocurrency continued to climb away from floor at $0.7000.
 
 
This coincided with the RSI moving away from a support level of its own at 45.00. It is now tracking at 48.24.
 
Despite this, the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages still look set for a downward cross in the coming days.
 
Should this occur, the next target for sellers will likely be near the $0.5900 zone.
