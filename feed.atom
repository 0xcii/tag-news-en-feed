        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The largest Bitcoin trust in the world, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has been closing ranks around its premium over the last year. After hitting an all-time low of -48.89% in December 2022, the gap has been effectively closed to the point that it has reached a two-year high.
 
GBTC Premium Sitting At -10.35%
 
The GBTC premium to NAV is the difference in how much a Bitcoin is priced in the Bitcoin trust compared to how much the cryptocurrency is trading on the open market. When the figure is positive (high), it means there is a lot of demand for the trust and it trading higher than spot volumes. But when the figure is negative (low), it means that BTC in the trust is trading lower than spot market prices.
 
 
This means that when the GBTC premium was at its lowest in 2022, BTC in the…]]></summary>

Investors and traders are bracing for the U.S. inflation report due to drop on Tuesday, which historically shakes up market sentiment and could tip the scales for future Federal Reserve rate hikes.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) has consolidated a great deal over the weekend and is currently moving in a tighter triangular pattern. So far while remaining range bound, the relative strength index (RSI), a key gauge of price momentum, suggests bitcoin is still trading in overbought territory with a reading of 77, hinting at more price pullbacks.
 
Bitcoin’s price has been between $36,692 and $37,291 per coin during the past 24 hours. The leading cr…]]></summary>

Bitget’s Hong Kong division, BitgetX, will cease operations by December 13, 2023. After this date, BitgetX’s website will

#1 Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval – Friday
 
As Bitcoinist reported earlier today, a critical window is currently open for the SEC to potentially approve all 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs. The deadline ends on November 17, after which newer filings will enter a public comment period. This is especially interesting because it is assumed that the SEC aims to avoid favoritism in a highly competitive market, as highlighted by industry experts. Remarkably, the SEC needs to make a decision on two spot Bitcoin ETFs by Franklin Templeton and Hashdex by November 17!

Bitcoin. The

What’s behind the BTC

It's crucial to dissect this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The  
entities overseeing the bankruptcy process of crypto platform FTX have filed a  
lawsuit accusing Mirana Corp, an investment arm Bybit, of receiving a  
substantial portion of $935 million in transfers just before FTX filed for  
Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The lawsuit alleges that these transfers were "made  
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud FTX.com's present or future  
creditors."
Bybit's  
Demand for $20 Million: Adding Complexity to the Dispute
FTX's  
bankruptcy managers argued that these transfers to Mirana Corp, Time Research,  
and specific individuals should be classified as fraudulent. Such fraudulent transfers would give FTX a  
legal basis to seek the return of the full amount of these transfers, along  
with interest, for the benefit of FTX's bankruptcy estates.
