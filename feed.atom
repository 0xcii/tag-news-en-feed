        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Block Green, a Switzerland-based Bitcoin liquidity protocol, and Merkle Standard, a U.S. Bitcoin mining company, have announced a partnership that allows Merkle Standard to utilize Block Green's platform to hedge future revenue risks and access immediate liquidity at “transparent and favorable rates.”
According to a press release, by facilitating mining rewards streaming agreements and employing Bitcoin script and custodial solutions, the platform unlocks opportunities for Bitcoin holders and miners, redefining the financing landscape and empowering participants with new market avenues.
The capabilities of Block Green's platform enable mining operators to sell exposure to their future revenues at a discount, addressing their liquidity needs effectively. Additionally, BTC holders can benefit from the platform, enjoying an attractive BTC-native return.
As part of the partnership, Merkle Standard plans to sell exposure to 100 PH/s of hashrate over a 30-day period, receiving 7.5 BTC in immediate upfront liquidity. Luxor Tech, a mining software and services company, is among the LPs that have filled the trade.
Sebastien Hess, CEO at Block Green, expressed excitement about the partnership, stating, "Our platform empowers Bitcoin miners to unlock and access future liquidity and hedge revenue risks, driving growth capital coupled with risk mitigation for sophisticated mining operations."
Head of Research at Merkle Standard, Holden Guillies, shared the enthusiasm, emphasizing the innovative nature of the collaboration, saying, "This innovative financial product provides us with a new way to manage risk by hedging mining difficulty while gaining upfront liquidity. We believe this partnership offers an essential tool to effectively plan, operate, and execute within the fast-moving Bitcoin mining industry."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano climbed higher to start the week, as bulls moved to buy the recent dip in price. The token dropped by over 30% over the weekend, as traders continued to react to the Robinhood delisting. Cosmos also rebounded, moving away from a one-year low.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) rebounded by nearly 5% to start the week, as traders moved to buy this weekend’s dip.
 
ADA/USD fell by over 30% in the past few days, dropping to a low of $0.2300 in the process.
 
However on Monday, the token rallied to an intraday peak of $0.2859, with bulls seemingly finding a stable floor at $0.2600.
 
 
This comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped back above the 20.00 region, and is now heading towards a ceiling at 31.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 24.99, which remains in oversold territory.
 
ADA is currently trading at $0.2815, down 24% from the same point last week.
 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Another notable token to climb higher on Monday was cosmos (ATOM), which also rebounded from recent losses.
 
Following a low of $8.21 on Sunday, ATOM/USD jumped to a high of $8.68 to start the new trading week.
 
The rally sees ATOM continue to move away from a one-year low at $7.31, which was hit on Saturday.
 
 
Similar to cardano, ATOM’s RSI reading remains below the 30.00 mark, which is a positive for longer-term bulls.
 
This shows that there is some potential upside in the market. However, volatility also remains high.

With the rise of regulatory actions against crypto firms in the US over the past few months, a16z’s announcement to establish a presence in another country can be seen as a strategic response to a changing business landscape.

Trust is a funny thing. Generationally speaking, one could make the argument that it is the job of the younger generation to essentially tell us older folks to go fly a kite (perhaps in more raw terms, and metaphorically of course) when it comes to our values, our norms, our advice, etc. Music provides an apt cultural landscape on which to view this tension.
The Same Old Song
In every generation, emerging and evolving musical forms have been decried by the older, traditional set as being bad music, noise, even not music at all. In the late 1950s, Walter Cronkite referred to jazz as “musical noise,” and his words were not offered as praise. Rockab…]]></summary>
