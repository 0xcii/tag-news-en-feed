        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the ongoing legal saga involving key figures of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, Ryan Salame, a former executive at the exchange, has filed a motion to challenge his current plea agreement with US authorities.
 
Prosecutors Alleged Breach Of Agreement
 
As reported by CNBC, Salame, who previously pleaded guilty to charges related to campaign finance and money-transmitting offenses, has petitioned a New York federal judge to invalidate his guilty plea. 
 
His defense team contends that prosecutors breached a top aspect of the plea agreement by resuming an investigation into his domestic partner, Michelle Bond, for alleged campaign finance violations despite assurances to the contrary.
 
 
The court filing by Salame’s lawyers reveals that the Manhattan US Attorney’s Office had purportedly…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong's spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their largest inflow of funds in over a month today, highlighting growing Asian interest in Bitcoin investment vehicles.

JUST IN: 🇭🇰 Hong Kong #Bitcoin ETFs saw $15 million in inflows today, the highest in a month.
Slowly and steadily 🙌 pic.twitter.com/Q83tjbS0ML
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 22, 2024
  
  
  
The ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF took in 274 Bitcoin worth around $15 million on August 22nd, its biggest single day of inflows since July 12th. The other two Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs - Bosera Hashkey and Harvest saw no flows today.
Hong Kong approved its first three spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, following the launch of similar products in the U.S. and Europe. The ETFs allow investors to be exposed to Bitcoin prices without having to handle the asset directly.
While Hong Kong's Bitcoin ETF volumes pale compared to those in the U.S., inflows have been steadily climbing. The ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF is the largest of the Hong Kong products, with over $141 million in net assets. Bosera Hashkey and Harvest Bitcoin ETFs have around $99 million and $30 million, respectively, under management.
The total assets under management across the three Hong Kong Spot Bitcoin ETFs is approximately 4,450 BTC worth around $270 million. 
While still modest, the growing inflows indicate increasing bitcoin interest and adoption among Asian institutional investors. As Bitcoin matures into an established asset class, Asian and global investors are seeking regulated exposure through products like spot ETFs.]]></summary>

This comes just a day after Salame made a last-ditch effort to have his conviction vacated or blocked.

The speculation is rampant about the potential implications for monetary policy and the broader financial landscape.
 
Notably, the Jackson Hole symposium comes on the heels of yesterday’s historic US Bureau of Labour Statistics US job revision. US job additions were revised lower by 818,000, the largest revision since 2009. This major revision underscores a softening labor market—a crucial factor for monetary policy considerations, just as inflation rates began to show signs of abating, with the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropping from 3.9% in December 2023 to 3.2% in July.
