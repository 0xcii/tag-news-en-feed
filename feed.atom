Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Has Been Mostly Negative In The Past Month
 
As CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn pointed out in a post on X, the Net Taker Volume suggests a lack of strong taker buy volume in the past month.
 
The “Net Taker Volume” is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin taker buy and taker sell volumes. Naturally, the two volumes measure the buy and sell orders filled by takers in perpetual swaps.
