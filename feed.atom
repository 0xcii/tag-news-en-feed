The latest powerplay? A Hail Mary interlocutory appeal from the authority. The agency tried appealing a past court decision allowing Ripple to use a “fair notice” defense. However, prominent lawyers vehemently oppose this, predicting its inevitable rejection.
 
Ripple’s chief counsel, James K. Filan, and Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal already called the SEC’s bluff. In their view, the rigid standards for an interlocutory appeal still need to be met. These mid-case appeals only proceed if waiting for a final verdict would cause “irreparable harm.” According to Filan, the agency has yet to prove this harm exists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin was easily one of the biggest movers in crypto markets to start the weekend, as price rose by over 10%. Saturday’s surge comes despite the global market cap mostly trending lower, having fallen by 0.43% as of writing. XRP was one of the tokens to fall, dropping below a key price floor.
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was a notable mover in today’s session, as the token rose by as much as 10% on Saturday.
 
After a low of $1.74 on Friday, TON/USD surged to an intraday peak of $1.95 to start the weekend.
 
As a result of the move, toncoin climbed to its strongest point since May 24, which was the last time price traded above $2.00.
 
 
Today’s rally comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rebounded at a floor of 75.00, following a surge above 83.00.
 
Price strength is deeply overbought, however this has not stopped bulls from continuing to send TON even higher.
 
This could be a recipe for a bear trap however, with a change in direction almost certainly on the cards in the not too distant future.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was in the red to start the weekend, as the token marginally dropped below a key support point.
 
XRP/USD fell to a bottom at $0.4886 on Saturday, which comes following a peak at $0.5081 the day prior.
 
This downturn comes as bears pushed price below a price floor of $0.5100 earlier in the week, with momentum continuing to slip since then.
 
 
Ever since the ripple ruling, which saw XRP price spike to an almost two-year high, the token has mostly moved lower.
 
The RSI is now tracking around a floor of 29.00, which is in the midst of a bear zone. However, should this level hold firm, there could be a reversal next week.

Back in May, the MakerDAO announced its “Endgame” network update aimed at improving the protocol’s “efficiency, resilience and participation” via the formation of a “strong governance equilibrium.” 
 
The “NewChain” is a vital part of the Endgame’s fifth and final phase, in which the MakerDAO protocol will be fully rebuilt on its own new, native layer-one blockchain. 
 
Christensen has described this final phase as a long-term project set to run for over three years. However, in easing the team’s effort, the MakerDAO Co-founder believes they can explore the fork of existing open-source blockchain rather than building a new protocol from scratch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the weekend trading below the $26,000 level, as bears seized market momentum to end the week. Price surged during the early part of the week, climbing over the $28,000 mark. However in the days that followed, sentiment has mostly trended lower. Ethereum remains in the red.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin continued to trend lower on Saturday, as the bears were once again in control of crypto market sentiment.
 
Following a high of $28,148 on Tuesday, BTC/USD started the weekend falling to a low of $25,362.61.
 
The decline has come as a result of profit taking, and also the changing economic climate in the United States.
 
 
Consumer spending is slowing, whilst the labor market remains tight as a result of increasing interest rates.
 
Looking at the chart, today’s decline pushed bitcoin below a key support point of $25,600, however bulls have since reentered.
 
At the time of writing, BTC is now trading at $25,818.66, with a target of $26,000 likely to be present throughout the weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
After almost falling below $1,600 on Friday, ethereum (ETH) was mostly higher to start the weekend’s session.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,650.71 earlier in the day, but momentum has since dropped, with the price now at $1,635.02.
 
The world’s second largest cryptocurrency has not been able to move back above $1,650, which has been a point of price support.
 
 
From the chart it appears that ETH managed to avoid dropping under $1,600 due to the relative strength index (RSI) colliding with a floor at 36.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 37.04, with the next visible ceiling at 49.00.
