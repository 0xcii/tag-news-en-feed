The financial giant’s analysis focuses on the dynamics involving the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States.
 
JP Morgan Foresees End Of Selling Pressure
 
The report acknowledges the recent 20% correction in BTC’s price over the past two weeks, attributing it largely to profit-taking on previous GBTC investments. JP Morgan analysts note, “Profit-taking on GBTC’s ‘discount to NAV trade’ has likely been a major driver behind Bitcoin’s correction; $4.3 billion has thus far exited GBTC since its conversion to ETF.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency  
exchange Bitget has enhanced the security of its platform wallets through an  
upgrade to Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology. MPC aims to boost wallet  
protections using distributed computing, homomorphic encryption, and a Trusted  
Execution Environment (TEE).
Bitget Upgrades Wallets  
with Advanced Security Technology
The  
technology implemented by Bitget works by dividing private keys into segments  
across multiple servers. Transactions can then occur without keys being  
revealed in one place. TEE also provides hardware-level security to fortify the  
wallet infrastructure. The upgrade  
follows Bitget's ongoing efforts to implement new security solutions. The  
company previously launched
