What made it more puzzling was that right when Sun took out the money, the price of Ethereum went down a bit. But, surprisingly, more people started trading Ethereum, and the trading volume increased by over 15%.

Current DCG chief financial officer Mark Shifke succeeds Silbert and is joined by Edward McGee and Matthew Kummell as members of the new look board. 
 
Preparing for Grayscale’s Next Chapter
 
Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, has resigned from his position as chairman of the digital asset management company Grayscale and will be replaced by Mark Shifke.
 
According to the company’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), starting Jan. 1, 2024, Grayscale’s board will be composed of Mark Shifke, Matthew Kummell, and Edward McGee. Current Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein is also a board member, while Mark Murphy, the president of Digital Currency Group (DCG), departs alongside Silbert.
 
Commenting on the changes to the board, an unidentified Grayscale spokeswoman reportedly said:
 
“Grayscale and our investors will benefit from their respective experiences in the financial services and asset management industries as we prepare for Grayscale’s next chapter.”
 
The changes to the Grayscale Investments board are coming at a time when the SEC is considering the company’s request to turn its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

The “mining hashrate” refers to the total amount of computing power currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. This metric is very relevant for the BTC network, as its value can have a direct influence on the chain’s security.
 
A larger hashrate means that there are more nodes for a malicious attacker to go through, as such an attack can only be successful if the attacker can bring under control at least 51% of the hashrate.
 
 
This benefit on the security from a higher value of the indicator only appears, though, if the new hashrate that’s being added by the miners is sufficiently dece…]]></summary>
