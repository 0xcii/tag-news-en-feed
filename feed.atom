        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin breached the $47K threshold on Monday, fueled by growing excitement over the potential launch of a U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The leading crypto asset kicked off the day at $43,247 per unit, then climbed to a peak of $47,281 by 2:10 p.m. Eastern Time (ET).
 
Bitcoin Rally Tops $47K
 

 
Monday afternoon witnessed a notable surge in the market cap’s leading crypto asset, occurring around 2 p.m. ET. Bitcoin (BTC) experienced an increase exceeding $3,600 from its daily low, with many analysts linking this upswing to the potential approval of several spot bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The latest market figures indicate that bitcoin’s previous encounter with this price bracket was in December 2021, following its descent from the record high of $69K.

The market valuation of the digital currency soared, reaching precisely $917 billion, eclipsing Meta (formerly Facebook) in market size and securing its position as the ninth-largest asset by market valuation. The trading volume for BTC has intensified, contributing $37.17 billion to the day’s total $144 billion in trades. Current statistics reveal that, at 3:10 p.m. ET, BTC’s market value of $46,922 is just over 32% below its all-time high of $69K, achieved on Nov. 10, 2021.
 

 

 

 
This uptick in price has resulted in the elimination of numerous short trading positions. Coinglass’s four-hour data indicates that $73.62 million in BTC shorts were liquidated, with approximately $13.75 million occurring following the surge past $47K. This increase in bitcoin’s price has also buoyed other cryptocurrencies, elevating the entire crypto market economy to a value of $1.80 trillion. Bitcoin dominates this figure with a 50.8% market share, while ethereum (ETH) holds a 15.6% stake in the combined market.

approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product by the Securities and  
Exchange Commission (SEC), Chair Gary Gensler's recent cautionary statements  
have cast a spotlight on the inherent risks within the crypto landscape. 
Gensler's thread on social media, although not  
explicitly addressing the pending spot Bitcoin ETF decision, underscores the  
significant concerns around crypto investments, emphasizing their volatility  
and susceptibility to fraudulent schemes.
Gensler has warned against the risks inherent in  
cryptocurrency investments. His social media thread, albeit not explicitly tied  
to the awaited ETF approval, sheds light on the broader concerns surrounding  
crypto investments.

2⃣ Investments in crypto assets also can be exceptionally risky & are often volatile. A number of major platforms & crypto assets have become insolvent and/or lost value. Investments in crypto assets continue to be subject to significant risk.
— Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) January 8, 2024
Highlighting Risks and Volatility
Gensler's cautionary tone concerns asset managers  
potentially bypassing federal securities laws with their crypto investment  
offerings. The SEC Chair's commentary alludes to the possibility that certain  
investment assets may not align with established regulatory frameworks,  
prompting a call for investors' vigilance and due diligence.
Gensler's remarks revolve around crypto investments'  
inherent volatility and vulnerability. His comments highlight the sector's  
susceptibility to market fluctuations and emphasize the need for investors to  
exercise caution, particularly given the prevalence of fraudulent activities in  
the crypto space.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.
