        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SHIB took the crypto market by storm when the Shiba Inu price bolted to its peak in 2021. Initially created as a lighthearted alternative to DOGE, it caught investors’ attention and resulted in this meteoric rise.

Bitcoin, in particular, has been inching close to its all-time high, and the recent break above $68,000 puts it only 8% away from setting a new price record. 
 
 
Interestingly, this inflow into Bitcoin has seen the cryptocurrency increase its dominance over altcoins. According to data, Bitcoin’s market dominance is now 65% of the total market cap, the highest in three years. This raises the question of whether the altcoin season will still materialize in the current market cycle.

Top analyst Daan recently shared his insights, stating that this breakout is now a reality, fueling optimism among investors.
 
 
As Bitcoin continues its climb, many anticipate a small retrace, followed by a strong bounce that could pave the way to challenge the all-time highs around $73,000.
