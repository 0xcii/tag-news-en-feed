        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin mining hashrate has sharply rebounded from its post-Halving lows and has achieved a new all-time high (ATH).
 
7-Day Average Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Just Set A New ATH
 
The Bitcoin network runs on a consensus mechanism known as the “proof-of-work” (PoW). In this system, validators called miners compete with each other using computing power to get the chance to add the next block to the blockchain.
 
The “mining hashrate” refers to a measure of the total computing power the miners have currently connected to the network for this purpose.
 
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that either exiting miners are expanding their facilities or new miners are joining the chain. Such a trend implies these validators are finding the network attractive …]]></summary>

Pepe (PEPE) Dominates Meme Coins Ahead Of Dogecoin
 
Pepe’s dominance in the meme coin space so far has been nothing short of astounding. Even after staging one of the fastest runs from under $500,000 market cap to over $1 billion, it is yet to run out of steam. Recently, it has been the only top meme coin hitting new all-time highs.

In a recent board of directors meeting, the company resolved to purchase an additional ¥250 million, currently worth $1.6 million USD, worth of Bitcoin.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 28, 2024
  
  
  
Metaplanet has recently outlined its approach to managing their Bitcoin. The company also stated that Bitcoins acquired for long-term purposes will be recorded at cost, ensuring stable accounting treatment over time. Conversely, Bitcoins held for short-term purposes will be revalued quarterly at market value. Any unrealized gains or losses from these short-term holdings will be recorded in the non-operating income section of the income statement, providing transparency and aligning with market fluctuations.
This strategic purchase follows a series of similar moves by companies globally, underscoring the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a strategic and valuable asset class. Metaplanet also acquired an additional 19.87 BTC earlier this month for a purchase price of 200 million yen.

        <updated>2024-05-28T16:28:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryan Salame, a former high-ranking official at Alameda Research and co-CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, has been sentenced to 90 months in prison for his involvement in what the US Southern District of New York calls “illegal political contributions” and operating an unlicensed money transmitter business. 
 
Conspiracy Charges In Financial And Political Schemes
 
The sentencing, delivered by US District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, follows Salame’s guilty plea to conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. 
 
 
The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, emphasized Salame’s actions’ consequences, which undermined public trust in American elections and the integrity of the financial system.
 
According to court filings and statements made during the proceedings, Ryan Salame served as a top official at Alameda Research, FTX’s trading arm founded by Samuel Bankman-Fried, from 2019 to 2021. In October 2021, Salame was appointed co-CEO of FTX’s Bahamian affiliate, FTX Digital Markets Ltd.
 
FTX Executive’s Covert Contributions
 
In addition to the unlicensed money-transmitting business, U.S. authorities allege that Salame conspired with Bankman-Fried and FTX executive Nishad Singh to make campaign contributions that concealed Bankman-Fried’s connection to the contributions. 
 
These contributions, totaling “tens of millions of dollars,” were intended to enhance Bankman-Fried’s standing in Washington, D.C., raise FTX’s profile, and curry favor with candidates who might sponsor legislation favorable to FTX, Alameda, or Bankman-Fried’s agenda. 
 
 
In addition to the 90-month prison term, Ryan Salame was sentenced to three years of supervised release. He has also been ordered to pay over $6 million in forfeiture and more than $5 million in restitution for the financial harm caused by his actions.
