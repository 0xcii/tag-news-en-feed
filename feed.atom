According to data from research firm Kaiko, the cumulative trade volume denominated in Korean won reached $456 billion, surpassing the $445 billion traded in US dollars.
 
This surge in Korean won-denominated trading, as Bloomberg reported, reflects the growing speculative demand for “risky crypto assets” within the country.
 
 
The Rise of Korean Won-Denominated Trading
 
According to Bloomberg, the rise in Korean won-denominated trading can be attributed in part to the fierce competition among local digital currency exchanges in South Korea.

As analyst Ali explained in a new post on X, the MVRV Momentum has been pointing out buying opportunities for the cryptocurrency since the current bull run started.
 
The MVRV ratio is a popular Bitcoin on-chain indicator that compares the asset’s market cap against its realized cap. The realized cap refers to a capitalization model for the asset that, in short, keeps track of the actual capital the holders as a whole have used to buy their coins.
