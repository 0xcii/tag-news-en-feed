        <link href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-ex-celsius-executive-pleads-guilty-to-criminal-charges/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-14T15:47:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The case against bankrupt crypto lender Celsius took a new turn as one of its former executives came forward. According to a report from Reuters, Roni Cohen-Pavon, ex-Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) at the company, pleaded guilty to criminal charges.
 
 
Celsius Former Executive Pleads Guilty, What Are The Implications
 
The report indicates that Cohen-Pavon attended a hearing today, September 14th, with US District Judge John Koeltl. At the hearing, the former Celsius executive pleaded guilty to manipulating the price of a crypto token, CEL, and four other counts.
 
Cohen-Pavon is one of the Celsius executives under legal scrutiny due to its involvement with the collapse of the crypto lender. The former CRO at this company was charged with the founder and CEO, Alex Mashinsky, in July 2023.
 
Unlike Cohen-Pavon, Mashinsky pleaded not guilty during his hearing. The former executive is expecting a sentence on December 11, 2024. It is unclear, but likely, that today’s events were motivated by an agreement.
 
In the US judicial system, individuals often plead guilty to certain charges when they reach a deal with US law enforcement in exchange for information that could help them get another conviction. The most likely target is Mashinsky.
 
As Bitcoinist reported, following Mashinsky’s arrest and not-guilty plea, the Celsius founder posted bail and now awaits trial. Just yesterday, the crypto founder tried to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
 
The Celsius former CEO has been accused of co-mingling, using his clients’ assets for his gain, and running an alleged fraudulent scheme. Celsius’ case has been heavily linked to that of the failed crypto exchange FTX and the collapse of the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem during the worst part of the “Crypto Winter” in 2022.
 
 
As of this writing, the CEL token trades at $0.10 after a significant downside price action pushed it from its 2023 highs north of $0.7.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-trx-rises-to-strongest-point-since-july-sol-extends-gains/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-14T15:40:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tron was a big mover on Thursday, as recent reports suggest that the blockchain platform has been processing an average of 4.8 million daily transactions. The token has now surged higher for three consecutive sessions, and looks set to collide with a key resistance level. Solana was also in the green today.
 
Tron (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) rose to a multi-week high on Thursday, on the back of reports claiming that the blockchain sees nearly 5 million daily transactions.
 
TRX/USD peaked at $0.08322 earlier in the day, which comes following a low of $0.08043 the day before.
 
As a result of today’s gains, tron has now risen to its highest point since July 30, when price traded at a high of $0.08395.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that bulls are attempting to reach a ceiling at $0.08600, however a hurdle on the relative strength index (RSI) seems to be preventing this.
 
Price strength is currently tracking at 67.89, which is marginally below a ceiling at the 68.00 level.
 
In order for bulls to capture their price target, this aforementioned resistance point will need to be broken.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rose for a third consecutive day on Thursday, as price moved closer to the coveted $20.00 mark.
 
SOL/USD surged by as much as 5% in today’s session, hitting an intraday peak of $19.27 in the process.
 
This move comes a day after the world’s ninth largest cryptocurrency traded at a bottom of $17.96.
 
 
Earlier gains in price have started to ease in the last few hours, after the RSI closed in on a ceiling of 43.00.
 
At the time of writing, it is at a reading of 41.05, with the token marginally below today’s high, sitting at $18.84.
 
Although $20.00 is still clearly the short-term target, it will likely take a significant amount of bullish momentum to get there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. Recently, market sentiment and expectations for the GameFi sector (also known as ‘X to Earn’) have soared again. LBank’s first Launchpad PINS (Chat to Earn) from last month has seen an increase of 1600% even in a bear market.
 
According to the announcement, LBank started its second Launchpad today, still in the GameFi domain. This project, called MetaExpand (UMM), significantly bridges the technological gap between public chains and metaverse applications. It offers storage, communication, privacy, cross-chain, and transaction plugins and development standards, making it easier for developers to create metaverse applications without worrying about underlying blockchain technology. Its game ‘Jurassic Virus’ allows players to explore and interact in a complex metaverse.

Deutsche Bank Jumps Into Custody, Is Bitcoin Trading Next?
 
According to a report from Reuters, the banking institution will hold Bitcoin and real-world tokenized assets for its clients. The latter are commodities, equity, or other real-world assets with a digital representation supported by a blockchain platform.
 
However, the report indicates that Deutsche Bank will stay in the custody business for now, with no plans of pursuing any other related activity with cryptocurrencies. In other words, the bank clarified its la…]]></summary>

As noted by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo on X, this week marks the eighth anniversary of Cathie Wood's decision to make Ark Invest the first U.S. exchange-traded fund (ETF) to invest in Bitcoin when its price was a mere $200 to $300 per coin. 
At that time, Bitcoin was still a relatively uncharted territory for traditional investment vehicles like ETFs. However, Wood's decision to include Bitcoin in ARKW's portfolio was groundbreaking and reflected her belief in the potential of the digital currency.
Wood remarked at the time: 
“We believe the bitcoin platform could be as big as the Internet platform, which, in its early days, also faced tests associated with illicit activities. We would prefer to invest after, rather than …]]></summary>

Fiat  
ramps are services that facilitate the conversion of traditional fiat

Ethereum, and vice versa. According to CZ, this crucial infrastructure is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin neared a two-week high on Thursday, as markets looked ahead to today’s retail sales report in the United States. Sales are expected to rise by 0.2% in August, a drop from a 0.7% increase the month before. Ethereum remained in the green, moving back above a key support point earlier in the day.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin remained in the green for a second consecutive session, ahead of the upcoming U.S. retail sales report. Consumer spending is expected to fall lower, which comes as inflation increased last month.
 
Following a low of $26,084.80 on Wednesday, BTC/USD surged to a peak of $26,529.50 earlier in today’s session.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge comes as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 45.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 49.04, which is marginally below a ceiling at the 53.00 mark.
 
Should it move beyond this, there is a good chance that bitcoin will rise above the $27,000 level in the coming days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) was also in the green on Thursday, as price rose above a recent support point.
 
ETH/USD reached a high of $1,635.82 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,593.11.
 
The move resulted in the world’s second largest cryptocurrency climbing above a key price floor at $1,620.
 
 
Similar to BTC, today’s rally coincided with the RSI moving past a ceiling of its own at the 40.00 mark, and it now sits at 44.00.
 
This latest rebound has increased the possibility of an upward cross, and should this happen, ETH will be trending closer to $1,700.
