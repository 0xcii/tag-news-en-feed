        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year, the spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is deemed certain by just 39% of financial advisors, according to a recent survey.
 
The survey’s findings demonstrate that financial advisors are generally skeptical of the commission’s decision to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).
 
There are several reasons for this lack of assurance. The SEC’s cautious and conservative past handling of cryptocurrency-related items is the first and most important factor.
 
Advisors Skeptical: SEC’s Bitcoin ETF Fate
 
Financial advisors appear pessimistic about the SEC’s approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF this year, based a survey conducted by Bitwise and VettaFi.
