        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a brief absence spanning several weeks, Kusama, the leading developer of Shiba Inu, has resurfaced with a cryptic tweet.
 
September was quite a busy month for the SHIB ecosystem, with a number of noteworthy occurrences including the SHIB burn rate increasing by more than 1300%, the tremendous growth of Shibarium, the announcement of Shibarium IDs, and the developers of Shiba Inu relinquishing their commitment to the BONE contract. While all these was happening, nothing was heard from Shytoshi Kusama, the Shiba Inu lead developer on social media. But this silence just changed with a cryptic post on X (formerly known as Twitter).

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ordinal-inscriptions-cool-down-after-historic-peak/"/>
        <updated>2023-10-01T14:41:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions have tapered off markedly since September 24, 2023, following a historic peak on September 15. This deceleration emerges as inscriptions nestled within the Bitcoin blockchain verge on the notable 35 million milestone.
 
A Look at Bitcoin’s Recent Inscription Decline as 35 Million Milestone Looms
 
The flurry of Ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin network saw a significant dip after the exhilarating climax of 440,760 inscriptions recorded in a single day on September 15. At present, the distributed ledger boasts 34,961,312 inscriptions, yet since September 24, the rate of minting has slowed a great deal.
 

 
For example, on September 30, 2023, a total of 28,400 inscriptions were chronicled onchain, while the preceding day witnessed the addition of 44,746 inscriptions. The day before that saw the inscription count scarcely nudging past the 100,000 threshold.
 
From September 2 through the 24th, the daily inscriptions remained above the 175,000 mark. Yet, as August drew to a close, a descent below the 100K realm was observed, with the tally on August 31 and September 1 dipping below 150K on both days.
 
While 2023 has seen its share of inscription lows, the recent plummet has been more pronounced. On the flip side, the deceleration in inscriptions has afforded miners the chance to tackle the backlog of unconfirmed transactions languishing in the mempool.
 
 
The reasons behind the slowdown in inscriptions remain a mystery, casting a veil of uncertainty on the duration of this lull, and whether or not a resurgence in inscriptions is on the horizon. Despite these uncertainties, the 35 million milestone is within reach, reflecting a trajectory that’s made a significant impact on the Bitcoin blockchain.

        <updated>2023-10-01T06:08:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto lender Blockfi is moving closer to returning funds to clients after a bankruptcy judge confirmed its Chapter 11 plan on Tuesday. The plan outlines a process for the company to distribute the remaining assets to clients and attempt to recover additional funds. 
 
Blockfi Advances on Client Asset Reimbursement Following Chapter 11 Plan Approval
 
With over 90% of voting creditors approving the plan, Blockfi expressed optimism about providing client recoveries relatively quickly compared to similar crypto bankruptcies. The plan confirmation comes after Blockfi originally filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022, amid the broader crypto market downturn.
 
Under the approved plan, Blockfi will first distribute the remaining digital assets back to clients with funds in Blockfi Wallet accounts. The company will then make an initial distribution to clients with funds in Blockfi Interest Accounts (BIAs) and retail crypto-backed loans.
 
“Over the coming months, you will receive an email prompting you to withdraw your funds based on the recovery amounts approved by the plan,” Blockfi told BIA and loan clients in a blog post. The firm expects wallet withdrawals to conclude before distributions to other clients begin.
 
 
Additional distributions to clients will depend on Blockfi’s success in recovering funds from the FTX bankruptcy case. Blockfi claims FTX owes it money and intends to pursue litigation to obtain those assets. Any funds recouped from FTX could increase client payouts.
 
Before distributions can formally start, a Bermuda court overseeing Blockfis international clients must recognize the U.S. bankruptcy court’s plan approval. Once finalized, Blockfi can emerge from bankruptcy and enact the wind-down process outlined in the plan.
