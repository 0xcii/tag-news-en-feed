Online casinos have always been at the forefront of technological innovation, constantly finding ways to offer better user experiences and more convenient transaction methods. In recent years, one of the most significant advancements among online casino sites has become the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a payment option.
 
The adoption of cryptocurrencies marks a pivotal shift in the online casino industry. Unlike traditional banking systems, which can be slow and often come with hefty fees, cryptocurrency transactions eliminate intermediaries and the associated costs. That, in return, increases transparency.
 
Let’s look into the top 5 best online casinos that accept cryptocurrencies in 2023.

As such, all eyes, especially of those in the XRP community, will be on the Commission and the crypto company as their actions on the day could potentially determine the next steps that will be taken in the case. 
 
Why November 9 Is Important
 
Following her dismissal order, Judge Anlaisa Torres had set November 9 as the deadline for both parties to jointly propose a briefing schedule with regard to remedies. Basically, Ripple and the Commission need to get back to the Judge on how they intend to proceed with the case. Failure to do this means that the court will have to step in and provide guidance to both parties.

        <updated>2023-11-09T10:37:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opensea recently retrenched an unknown number of employees as part of what the CEO Devin Finzer describes as a rebuilding exercise. According to the CEO, taking this step helps Opensea build a foundation which enables it to innovate faster.
 
Smaller Team With Direct Connection to Users
 
Opensea, one of the largest non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, recently parted ways with some of its long-serving employees as part of a rebuilding exercise. According to Devin Finzer, the co-founder and CEO of Opensea, the objective of the exercise is to have “a smaller team with a direct connection to users.” Finzer said while the departure is the “most difficult part of this change,” taking this step helps Opensea build a foundation which enables it to innovate faster.
 
Finzer’s confirmation of the workers’ retrenchment is coming at a time when the NFT hype continues to fizzle out. As recently reported by Bitcoin.com News, the NFT sales, which have been trending downwards since February 2023, went down by 21% in October. The flagging NFT sales have seen one of Opensea’s biggest investors Coatue mark down its investment by 90%.
 
 
However, in a statement shared via X (formerly Twitter), the CEO appeared to shrug off fears that Opensea will continue to see reduced sales revenues.
 
“We’re making these changes with our community in mind. As we rebuild, we’ll continue supporting our existing products, and will be iteratively testing Opensea 2.0 in public — remaining nimble, attentive, and focused,” Finzer said.
 
The CEO added that his organization is now working on “re-orienting the team around” the upgraded product.
