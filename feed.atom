        <updated>2024-01-29T19:05:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Google has revised its advertising guidelines, now permitting cryptocurrency trusts, such as Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), to promote their products. Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have wasted no time in marketing their funds, with advertisements already starting to emerge.



This revision comes at an interesting time as the discussion around Bitcoin ETFs continues to gains momentum, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country. Google's decision to allow advertising for Bitcoin ETFs provides these financial instruments with a much broader reach and exposure to a wider audience.
The updated guidelines mean that companies managing Bitcoin ETFs can now leverage Google's advertising platform to raise awareness and attract investors. This change could contribute to increased visibility and understanding of Bitcoin ETFs among both institutional and retail investors.
Google's decision aligns with the growing acceptance of Bitcoin and related investment products in mainstream finance. The move is likely to help foster a more innovative environment for Bitcoin, as it integrates more into traditional financial markets. As the industry eagerly awaits to see how well these revised guidelines are for the Bitcoin ETFs, the impact on the advertising landscape for them could be substantial.]]></summary>

These outflows predominantly stemmed from Grayscale’s converted spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (GBTC), though its impact seems to be diminishing with daily outflows reducing progressively throughout the week. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, highlights this trend, noting a decrease in the intensity of outflows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the first time since launch, BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF is outpacing the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in terms of trading volume so far today, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.



BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF volume surpassing GBTC for the first time hints at a slow down in outflows for Grayscale's ETF, which has had over $5 billion in outflows since launch. As highlighted below, the other spot Bitcoin ETFs have had total gross inflows of over $5.8 billion.



This trend could mark a significant shift in suggesting that the selling of GBTC is weakening, thus easing their current massive selling pressure of Bitcoin. Other spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced large amounts of inflows such as BlackRock and Fidelity, who have a combined 98,264 BTC worth over $4.1 billion for their ETFs. 
As GBTC outflows lessen and inflows of other spot Bitcoin ETFs rise, BTC will continue to get taken off the market in record pace. To put this all into context, BlackRock have accumulated over 52,026 BTC since launch earlier this month. MicroStrategy, known for their aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, have accumulated 189,150 BTC over the last ~four years.
As market participants eagerly wait in anticipation for the final numbers at the end of the day to see if the inflows on BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF can continue to outpace the outflows of GBTC, Bitcoin pumps over $43,000.]]></summary>

Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan Ho-lim stated that the government will aim to mitigate the risks of virtual assets amidst the rising interest of mainland investors using the city as a bridge to invest in crypto assets.
Hong Kong to Push Stronger Regulation for Crypto OTC Desks
Hong Kong is preparing to strengthen its regulatory framework for over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency operations. According to local reports, the decision has been influenced by the influx of Chinese mainland investors to the Hong Kong market who use the city as a bridge for these investments.
Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan Ho-lim stated that with these actions, Hong Kong authorities will aim to mitigate the potential risks of virtual assets while providing transparency for the users investing in these assets.
Earlier reports explained that Chinese investors were investing in cryptocurrency assets to escape the sluggish performance of the mainland national stock market. Reuters stressed these investors were using Hong Kong-based platforms to get around the ban that the mainland declared on the trading of crypto assets in 2021, using their $50,000 foreign currency quota for this objective.
Local sources did not specify if these new determinations for OTC markets were already prepared or still a work in progress.
In contrast to mainland China, Hong Kong has been open to cryptocurrency, with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) having recently published the norms that will regulate the future issuance of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the country. The SFC recognized the popularity of virtual assets in the city and reported a high demand for instruments leveraging these virtual assets.

The report states, “The multi-chain era has had a sweeping impact on the distribution of illicit crypto volume as a whole, where Bitcoin’s share plummeted from 97% in 2016 to 19% in 2022. In 2016, two thirds of crypto hack volume was on Bitcoin; in 2022, it accounted for just under 3%, with Ethereum (68%) and Binance Smart Chain (19%) dominating the field. And while Bitcoin was the exclusive currency for terrorist financing in 2016, by 2022 it was all but replaced by assets on the TRON blockchain, with 92%.”
