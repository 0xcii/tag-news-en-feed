        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sent shockwaves through the crypto industry in recent days by taking legal action against Binance.US and Coinbase. The news about Binance was not even 24 hours old when the SEC followed up with a lawsuit against Coinbase.
 
According to the SEC, Coinbase lacked licenses to operate its trading platform. The agency is also taking aim at Coinbase’s staking program, as Bitcoinist reported.
 
According to the order, Coinbase has 28 days to show cause why the SEC should not order the company to cease and desist from allegedly selling unregistered securities. However, a resolution in that time frame is unlikely, especially because Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has already announced that he is ready to take on the regulator.

These proposed rules were reported as the number of crypto holders in the UK more than doubled in the past year.  

New Crypto Ads Rules in the UK  

According to the documents published today (Thursday), the new rules will classify cryptocurrencies as “restricted mass market investments” and require “clear risk warnings” on any crypto advertisements or promotions.
