Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Distribution Appears To Be Ending
 
As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the BTC long-term holders are currently showcasing a trend that’s reminiscent of 2021.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto analyst Kyle Chasse has given his price predictions for different crypto tokens. His price targets for Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP were eye-catching, considering the heights he expects these coins to reach. 
 
Dogecoin To $2 And XRP To $3
 
Chasse mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin will climb to $2 and XRP to $3. His prediction for Dogecoin stands out given that other crypto analysts like Altcoin Sherpa have predicted that $1 is the highest level the crypto token can attain in this bull run. As such, Chasse’s prediction undoubtedly increases expectations for the meme coin in this cycle. 
 
 
Interestingly, Chasse’s prediction for Dogecoin still feels conservative, considering that crypto analyst Kevin (formerly Yomi OG) predicted that the meme coin could rally above…]]></summary>

It’s a very nuanced clash where it’s difficult to find the correct “ideological” response. I won’t be trying to give a definitive answer here, as that’s ultimately up to the community at large. But hopefully we can all agree to some common ground rules that can help us resolve the debate without going into another war resulting in bitter hard forks.
A Tale of Free Markets and the Higher Purpose
The complexity of the debate lies in the cognitive dissonance that Ordinals trigger within the Bitcoin community. It’s safe to say that Bitcoiners are very much pro-free markets, pro-liberty and pro-financial freedom.

Kiyosaki, a longtime advocate for “real money” like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, fears the BRICScoin could trigger hyperinflation in the US, causing the dollar to lose its global dominance and ultimately collapse.
 
Hyperinflation Or Hyperbole?
 
While Kiyosaki paints a stark picture of a dollar deluge flooding the US economy, experts remain divided on the BRICScoin’s true impact. The very existence of the stablecoin is still under discussion within the BRICS alliance.
