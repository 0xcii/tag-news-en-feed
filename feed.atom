In 2022, 51 exchanges were reported dead, with the vast majority seemingly dying out due to business reasons and there were small percentages of scams, rebranding and regulatory deaths.
 
FTX – Star of the Show
 
Out of all the exchange casualties of 2022, FTX received the most attention, namely due to its sheer size and perceived strength (previously the third-largest exchange by trading volume).

Tron’s USDD Stablecoin Depegs To Lowest Value Since June 2022
 
Tron’s Decentralized USD (USDD), which had already been struggling with its peg this last month as it stayed below $1, has observed further destabilization today as it touched lows not seen since June.
 
Below is a chart that shows the trend in the stablecoin’s price (against USD) over the last 24 hours:

This is an opinion editorial by Conor Chepenik, a Bitcoin pleb.
When a doctor operates on a wounded patient, the first thing they do is make sure they can stop the bleeding. No point operating if you can’t get the bleeding under control because the patient will die. Money facilitates mutual exchange and helps market actors coordinate price discovery — it is the literal blood of the economy. As fiat currencies slowly bleed out in value, they incentivize fewer people to save. If you want to stop the bleeding in your financial life, you are going to need to find a way to store your wealth in something else. There are plenty of options, but only one that is programmed …]]></summary>

The ripple effect of this lack of credibility from FTX has led many centralized exchanges to murky waters. For instance, Gemini has downsized its staff to make up for deficits with the fear index high in the market. 
 
Due to the gross misappropriation of funds – in the past, the scrutiny is now more than ever on exchanges.
 
Binance – the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, is now in the eye of the storm. The United States Department of Justice; is divided on its decision to charge the exchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was in the red to start the week, with prices falling to a 20-day low on Monday. The meme coin has now moved lower for four straight sessions, with the latest decline seeing price move below a key support point. Dogecoin was also down, hitting a two-week low earlier today.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was down on Monday, as the meme coin moved to its lowest point in the past 20 days.
 
Following a high of $0.000009282, SHIB/USD was down by nearly 5% today, hitting a low of $0.000008794 in the process.
 
This bottom is the lowest point that SHIB has traded at since November 22, when the token was at a low of $0.00000817.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the move comes as shiba inu broke out of a floor at the $0.00000885 mark.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also fell, dropping below a floor at the 43.70 level in the process.
 
Should this bearish momentum continue, we could see SHIB sellers attempt to recapture the low last seen on November 22.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) also remained in the red to start the week, as it also declined for a fourth straight day.
 
DOGE/USD declined to an intraday low of $0.08729 on Monday, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $0.09682.
 
As a result of this decline, which saw DOGE drop by nearly 10%, the token hit its lowest point since November 25.
 
 
Looking at the chart, bearish momentum has recently intensified following a drop below a floor of 48.00 on the RSI.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average also appears to be heading towards its 25-day (blue) counterpart, with a downward cross looking inevitable.
 
Should this crossover take place, it is likely that DOGE will move even lower, with a floor of $0.080 a possible destination.
