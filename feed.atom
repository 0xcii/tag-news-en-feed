        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Marek Feder, the editor in chief of Investro and a Bitcoin journalist who recently attended the BTC Prague event.
Let’s start with a disclaimer: I am not associated with the organizers of BTC Prague in any way, so in this article, I only provide my personal experience and views as an attendee. And one more disclaimer: I have not been to many Bitcoin conferences, so my takes and impressions from BTC Prague might be old news for some of you. However, I do believe that it was the first “huge” Bitcoin conference not only for myself, but also for countless others from Central Europe, so it might be nice to sum up the whole experience. 
A Conference Literally For Anyone
The fact that the cheapest ticket to BTC Prague was only 9 euro (about $11) means that this con…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Rally Has Taken A Large Number Of Short-Term Holders Into Profit
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, 2.6 million coins held by the short-term holders are now carrying some unrealized profit. The “short-term holders” (STHs) here refer to all those investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago.
 
Statistically, the longer an investor holds their coins, the less likely they become to sell said coins at any point. Thus, since the STHs haven’t been holding their coins since that long ago, they are the weak hands of the market who may easily sell at the sight of FUD or profit-taking opportun…]]></summary>

Evidence of
