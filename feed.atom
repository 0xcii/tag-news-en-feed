        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taiwan  
has taken its initial steps towards the regulation of digital assets by  
presenting a crypto bill to the Legislative Yuan for its first reading. The  
proposed legislation, known as the Virtual Asset Management Ordinance Draft  
bill, aims to define virtual assets, establish operational standards for asset operators,  
ensure customer protection, and mandate membership in industry associations and  
regulatory permissions.
Regulatory Drive in Taiwan:  
Fueled by FTX's Collapse
Taiwan  
has adopted a relatively hands-off approach to the cryptocurrency sector,  
primarily regulating it under existing know-your-customer and anti-money  
laundering laws. 
However,  
the regulatory process gained momentum following the collapse of the crypto  
exchange FTX in November. The exchange ha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic says there is no evidence that Hamas has received significant volumes of cryptocurrency donations, emphasizing that crypto data it provides on the matter has been misrepresented. Noting that crypto accounts linked to Hamas have been seized or frozen, Elliptic says: “This illustrates the weakness of crypto as a terrorism fundraising tool. The transparency of the blockchain allows illicit funds to be traced, and in some cases linked to real-world identities.”
 
Hamas’ Crypto Amounts Raised ‘Tiny’ Compared to Other Funding Sources
 
Blockchain analysis provider Elliptic published a blog post on Wednesday to set the record straight regarding crypto crowdfunding by Hamas, the military organization currently at war with Israel. This clarification followed numer…]]></summary>

His testimony provided a glimpse of what line of argument is to be expected from the defense as the case progresses. As Bankman-Fried’s lawyers questioned him, they emphasized on a particular document that could be the key to exonerating the defendant. 
 
Why This FTX Document Is So Important
 
According to a post by Inner City Press, which live posted happenings at the trial, Bankman-Fried’s primary counsel, Mark Cohen, had questioned the defendant about a ‘Document Retention Policy.’ In reply, SBF mentioned that the policy had been drawn up by the law firm Fenwick and West and, more specifically, Dan Friedman.

The

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Proof-of-Stake (PoS) assets have recently faced a notable shift. According to a report, the market capitalization of PoS assets took some kind of beating, dropping by 7% in the third quarter of the year, with the total value shrinking to $254 billion. This decline has raised questions about the performance and future prospects of PoS assets.
 
PoS assets are a type of cryptocurrency that operates on a different principle than Proof-of-Work (PoW) assets like Bitcoin. In PoS, the validation of transactions and creation of new blocks are not dependent on energy-intensive mining processes. Instead, validators, or “stakers,” are chosen to create new blocks and verify transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to “stake” as collateral.
