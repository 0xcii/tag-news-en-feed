        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea-based digital asset company Delio has  
temporarily suspended withdrawals over what it termed as a 'sharp  
increase in market volatility and confusion among investors'. This was  
after Haru Invest, another digital asset company, suspended deposits and  
withdrawals.
"In this situation,  
to safely protect the assets of customers currently in custody, Delio will  
inevitably suspend withdrawals as of June 14, 2023, 18:30, until the above  
situation and its aftermath are resolved," the statement, originally  
written in Korean and translated using Google Translate, said.

In a bold move, Paul Grewal, the company’s chief legal officer, has accused the regulator of preemptively imposing its authority and basing its proposed rules on unsubstantiated assumptions about cryptocurrency jurisdiction. 
 
This clash between Coinbase and the SEC highlights the growing tension between the cryptocurrency industry and regulatory bodies, igniting a fervent debate about the future of digital assets. 
 
As Coinbase challenges the SEC’s proposed rules, it raises important questions about the balance between innovation and regulation in the evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

In any case, the Prometheum story is the strangest thing to happen in this industry in a long time. Strangely, the story is flying under the radar so far and has received little attention.
 
So, what is it about? Last month, just two weeks before the SEC’s actions against Coinbase and Binance US, Prometheum received approval to become the first special purpose broker-dealer (SPBD) of its kind for securities with digital assets. In doing so, Prometheum became the first company to receive approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to provide custody of digital securities as a broke…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to the unique traits it presents, Latin America has been a thriving region for cryptocurrency, as the technology aims to complement or even substitute traditional finance components that cannot be used in certain countries in the area.
 
Marked by the vast differences between its countries, grouping Brazil — one of the first economies of the world — and countries like Venezuela and Argentina, which face enormous economic challenges, Latam is home to two crypto use cases. The first presents its speculative side, while the second, grassroots-focused use case seeks to substitute payment channels in sanctioned countries, serving as a hedge against devaluation and inflation.
 
Bitcoin mining is also an emergent activity on the continent, with companies seeking to take advantage of the cheap power tariffs and ideal climates that countries like Paraguay and Argentina offer to incoming mining companies.
 
The region is home to El Salvador, the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, which is now facing various challenges stemming from the emergence of this currency in a dollar-dominated economy.
