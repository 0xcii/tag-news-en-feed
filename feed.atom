Bitcoin Supply Held By Sharks Has Sharply Gone Up Recently
 
As analyst Willy Woo explains in a new post on X, a group of high-net-worth Bitcoin investors has been buying heavily recently. More specifically, these holders are carrying between 100 and 1,000 BTC in their wallets right now.
 
At the current cryptocurrency exchange rate, the lower bound of this range is about $6.2 million, while the upper one is about $62 million. Investors of this size are popularly known as “sharks.”
 
 
Given these large holdings, sharks can exert some influence in the market, although they are less significant than the whales, the largest holders (1,000+ BTC).

Solana Shows Growth On D1 Timeframe
 
Crypto analyst Maximilian FX has predicted that the Solana price could be on its way to a resurgence. The analyst points to the ascending growth of SOL on the D1 timeframe as one of the reasons why the altcoin is set to recover.
 
 
Maximilian FX explains that the crypto market has also reversed from its bullish trend. This happened earlier in the week and the market began to recover once more, pushing the Bitcoin price above $63,000 for a brief period.
