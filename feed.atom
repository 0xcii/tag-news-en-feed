        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ltc-back-under-90-00-as-sol-extends-declines/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-01T15:43:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin fell below the $90.00 level on Monday, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remained mostly bearish. The global market cap is down 1.87% at the time of writing, which seems to be a result of the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Solana was also in the red today.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was down for a second straight session on Monday, as markets prepared for the upcoming United States Federal Reserve policy decision.
 
LTC/USD dropped to low at $86.83 earlier in today’s session, which comes 24 hours after trading at a high of $91.39.
 
Today’s drop in price has pushed litecoin to its weakest point since last Wednesday, when the token was at a low of $84.21.
 
 
Looking at the chart, Monday’s move came as the relative strength index (RSI) fell to a support level at 44.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.80, with an upcoming ceiling of 50.00 a potential target for bulls.
 
Should this point be hit, there is a strong possibility that LTC will move back above the $90.00 mark.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
In addition to litecoin, solana (SOL) was another notable mover on Monday, as the token fell for a third consecutive day.
 
Following a high of $23.93 on Sunday, SOL/USD slipped to a bottom of $22.05 earlier in the day.
 
This bearish spell started after bulls were unable to force a breakout beyond a ceiling at the $24.00 mark.
 
 
One of the catalysts for this was the RSI, which also failed to surge past a key resistance level at 55.00
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 48.58, with the next visible floor at the 45.00 zone.

The SUI layer 1 blockchain, which has been under development for a while now, gained massive attention and interest from the crypto community following the announcement of its mainnet launch scheduled on May 3, 2023.
 
Not just that, news of the SUI token introduction on the Binance launchpool also sparked the interests of crypto investors, which may likely include that of the TRON Founder, who deposited a significant volume of the token required to farm SUI tokens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has served a $4 million fine to Coinme over its initial coin offering (ICO) of UpToken. 
 
Based on the SEC’s order, the UPToken ICO, which Coinme and its subsidiary conducted from October 2017 to December 2017, was an investment contract based on the Howey test.
 
The SEC also believes that the company’s offer of unregistered securities to crypto investors and traders was “misleading,” necessitating the fine.
 
SEC Serves Coinme $4 Million In Fines
 
Recently, the SEC stated that Coinme’s misleading marketing strategy violated securities laws as Coinme did not register the tokens as securities, and the company did not qualify for an exemption from registration requirements.

The recent action follows Ripple’s monthly routine when it unlocks tokens from a pre-timed Escrow system. Ripple designed its Escrow system to lock some amounts of XRP in a smart contract over a pre-programmed time. This system creates a predictable and stable XRP circulating supply.
 
The California-based fintech company has practiced this system monthly since 2018, except in November 2022.

This is an opinion editorial by Jaime García, a Salvadoran-Canadian Bitcoiner and co-host of Global Bitcoin Fest.
The hype around Bitcoin NFTs, made possible through inscriptions that use the Ordinal protocol, is undeniable. Trader and art dealer Steven Hay has even suggested that the government of El Salvador release an official Ordinal art collection to potentially raise money to fund its proposed Bitcoin City or otherwise accelerate Bitcoin adoption.
Unfortunately, this suggestion seems to lack an on-the-ground Salvadoran perspective and, in my view, is a blatant attack on El Salvador’s Bitcoin objectives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week trading in the red, as markets prepared for an important week of U.S. economic events. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is expected to increase rates by 25 basis points, with nonfarm payrolls for April being released this coming Friday. Ethereum was also lower in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade lower on Monday, as markets remained in consolidation ahead of a pivotal week of economic events.
 
Following a high of $29,952.03 on Sunday, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $28,360.50 earlier today.
 
This move saw bitcoin briefly fall below a key support point at $28,500, hitting its lowest point since April 27 in the process.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, bitcoin remains nearly 4% higher than at the same point last week, when prices were close to the $27,000 mark.
 
As a result of today’s sell-off, the relative strength index (RSI) has dropped to a floor of its own at 50.00.
 
The index is now tracking at 50.09, with BTC rebounding from its earlier low, and currently trading at $28,591.66.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also in the red, as prices plunged for a second consecutive session.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,829.41 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after trading at a peak of $1,938.42.
 
Similar to BTC, today’s slippage sent ethereum below its own point of support at the $1,830 level.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
ETH has since rebounded from this floor, as bulls opted to buy the dip, rather than continuing to flee positions.
 
This was helped by the fact that the RSI here also collided with a support zone at 45.00, and it continues to track beyond this point.
 
Bulls will likely be targeting reentry above $1,900 in upcoming days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
