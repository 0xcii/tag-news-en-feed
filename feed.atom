This historic law not only brings Russia into the global crypto economy but also sets in motion a legislative blueprint to prevent illegal activity, so ensuring the nation stays both a player and a watchdog in the digital financial scene.
 
New Regulations For Crypto Miners
 
According to multiple news outlets, the new legislation, set to go into effect this November, gives registered legal firms and individual entrepreneurs exclusive rights to mine cryptocurrencies in an attempt to balance innovation and control.
 
There is, however, a break for the small players: people who stay within certain government-set energy consumption limits can mine without having …]]></summary>

WazirX To Restore All Account Balances

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded their largest inflows in over two weeks on Thursday, totalling $192.5 million. This comes after Bitcoin dipped below $50,000 earlier this week amid a global market selloff.

NEW: 🇺🇸 #Bitcoin ETFs saw $192 million in inflows, the highest in over two weeks.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 9, 2024
  
  
  
The inflows helped propel Bitcoin back above $60,000 on Friday. It represents a swift reversal after Bitcoin plunged nearly 20% to its lowest level since February.
The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the bounce back, with inflows of $157.6 million on Thursday. The WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (BTCW) also had a standout day, attracting over $118.5 million in fresh capital—its largest single-day haul since launching.
BTCW has generally lagged behind rivals, struggling to break $11 million in daily inflows since debuting in January. Its prior record was $10.5 million. But Thursday's surge made it the top performer.
The inflows provide evidence of renewed appetite for Bitcoin exposure after a wave of selling earlier in the week, which also battered stock markets like the Nasdaq. Last Friday's disappointing U.S. jobs report triggered recession fears.
The bounce back in prices and inflows suggests the Bitcoin selloff may have been a temporary blip rather than the start of a new bearish trend. The recovery to $60,000 has bulls eyeing a retest of all-time highs above $73,000 in 2024.]]></summary>
