        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rise of crypto has brought with it a new wave of cybercrimes, challenging the conventional methods employed by law enforcement agencies. With blockchain transactions inherently designed to provide anonymity, authorities have often found themselves at an impasse when tracing illicit crypto activities. 
 
However, a recent development in Canada has shown a breakthrough in this standoff, illustrating a potential model for global law enforcement. Particularly, Canadian police have incorporated advanced technology into their investigative procedures, enabling them to delve deeper into the blockchain realm. 
 
Through specialized software, they can now trace blockchain transactions to their source, identify perpetrators, and pinpoint the exact destination of funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The X (Twitter) account of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm focused on cryptocurrencies, was hijacked by scammers aiming to entice users with a fraudulent token claim scheme.
 
On August 9, several messages emerged from Blockchain Capital’s account, promoting a giveaway of tokens called “BCAP.” These messages guided users to a fraudulent website that imitated the legitimate appearance of the actual Blockchain Capital company’s site.
 
The attacker’s website connected to the Blockchain Capital X account was deliberately crafted with a URL closely resembling the authentic one, achieved by adding an additional “n.” This malicious site then directed users to link their cryptocurrency wallets as per its instructions.

In a submission to a federal court in New York, Musk’s legal team formally requested the elimination of the plaintiff’s revised complaint. 
 
Echoing this motion, Alex Shapiro, the attorney representing Elon Musk, vehemently criticized the most recent complaint put forth by the Dogecoin investors, characterizing it as a case in point of “abusive and belligerent litigation tactics” employed by the opposing side.
 
 
 
“Enough is enough,” Shapiro wrote. “This action is yet another example of counsel’s abusive and belligerent litigation tactics.”
