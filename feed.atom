        <updated>2024-05-15T14:58:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[El Salvador has mined nearly 474 bitcoins worth around $29 million since September 2021 using geothermal energy from the Tecapa volcano, official data revealed. This boosts the country's total bitcoin holdings to 5,750 BTC valued at over $360 million.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 15, 2024
 
 
 
The renewable energy mining operation is a collaborative effort between El Salvador and bitcoin mining firms like Foundry USA, Antpool, ViaBTC, F2Pool, and Binance Pool. It utilizes the geothermal power from Tecapa, one of El Salvador's many active volcanoes.
Of the 102 megawatts generated by the state-owned geothermal power plant beside the volcano, 1.5 megawatts go toward Bitcoin mining. President Nayib Bukele has installed 300 specialized mining processors to facilitate the process.
El Salvador made headlines in 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. Despite criticism from the IMF and others, Bukele has remained committed to Bitcoin, with a Bitcoin mining operation powered by volcano-fueled geothermal energy embodying this forward-thinking approach.

The country's mining accomplishments stand in stark contrast to the scrutiny bitcoin miners face worldwide over energy usage. By tapping geothermal energy from Tecapa, El Salvador provides a renewable model for potential adoption elsewhere.
The $29 million mined demonstrates the substantial, real-world value unlocked by El Salvador's status as the first Bitcoin nation. As more renewable mining comes online globally, the country's volcanic model provides an ambitious precedent.]]></summary>

The recent halving cut the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, meaning miners now receive half as much for verifying transactions and mining new blocks. As noted in a recent report by Kaiko, miner revenues have plummeted since the halving, and miners are beginning to feel the pressure. 
 
Bitcoin Under Increased Pressure
 
Bitcoin miners largely rely on two revenue streams to keep operating: the mining reward and transaction fees. The Bitcoin market is cyclical and each halving has historically led to an increase in selling pressure from the miners. Data shows that the recent April halving has led to a fall in the Bitcoin hash rate with mining profitabilit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For investors hoping for a simple way to gain exposure to Ethereum, the road seems paved with regulatory hurdles. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thrown a wrench into plans for spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), leaving the future of these investment vehicles shrouded in uncertainty.
 
 
Security Or Commodity? The Ethereum Classification Conundrum
 
The crux of the issue lies in the SEC’s classification of Ethereum (ETH) itself. Bloomberg analysts, including Eric Balchunas, believe the SEC views ETH as a security, not a commodity – and that the chances of its ETF getting the regulator’s nod is “slim to none.”
 
This distinction is crucial because commodity ETFs are generally easier to get approved than security ETFs. The SEC’s recent inquiries regarding whether…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stablecoin issuer Circle plans to move its legal base from  
Ireland to the US, according to recent court filings, Bloomberg reported. This  
action is significant for the company behind the second-largest stablecoin,  
USDC, ahead of its anticipated initial public offering. 
The decision to shift its legal base has significant implications for Circle, particularly in terms of taxes. While Ireland has been attractive to multinational corporations due to its relatively low corporate taxes, recent reforms imposing a minimum 15% tax on the profits of larger  
multinationals have eroded some of that advantage.

By moving to the US, Circle may face heavier tax

Ramji will replace Vanguard's outgoing CEO, Tim Buckley. Buckley has been publicly critical of Bitcoin and opposed offering Bitcoin ETF products to clients. 
Under Buckley's leadership, Vanguard refused to provide its brokerage customers access to U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs that were approved by the SEC.
The appointment of Ramji, set to take effect July 8, signals a potential change in Vanguard's stance. As head of BlackRock's iShares division, Ramji oversaw the launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.
Ramji has spoken positively about the technology underpinning Bitcoin and its potential to remove friction in financial markets. 
His experience pioneering Bitcoin ETFs at BlackRock has many wondering if he will now push for similar offerings at Vanguard.

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, bringing in the bitcoin-friendly Ramji means the door is "much more open now" for Vanguard to embrace Bitcoin.
The company offers index funds and ETFs to both retail and institutional investors. 
As a massive player in the ETF space with over $7 trillion in global AUM, Vanguard launching a spot bitcoin ETF would be an important milestone for further mainstream adoption.]]></summary>
