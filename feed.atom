        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the United States stares down the barrel of a potential debt default come June, a curious and intriguing solution has emerged: crafting a single $1 trillion platinum coin. This unusual tactic exploits a legal loophole that allows the Treasury Department to mint platinum coins of any value. By delivering such a coin to the U.S. central bank, the Treasury would create enough funds to settle its debts. Though this proposal might sound bizarre, it’s gained traction as a potential escape route from the impending debt catastrophe.

The loans and collateral were provided shortly before Alameda Research and the exchange filed for bankruptcy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[France’s Senate Committee on Economic Affairs has made changes to a proposal under Bill No. 790 previously passed in the National Assembly. The original bill would have made it incredibly hard for crypto companies, including exchanges, from using the services of commercial social media influencers in their marketing campaigns. 
 
Reviewing The Strict Bill
 
The content of the latest version of Bill No. 790, reviewed by the Senate Committee, is “more relaxed” than the one passed by the National Assembly.
 
Specifically, it eliminates the need for crypto firms to get licensed after being registered by the country’s regulator, Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) before soliciting the services of an influencer to market their services.

The firm plans to stop issuing the new Bitcoin-backed loans effective on May 10. It added that the action would not affect customers’ outstanding loans already running on the platform. So, such users will still repay their loans in line with the agreed loan duration.
 
Coinbase Reached Decision During Product Evaluation
 
Coinbase Borrow is available only in some states in the US and it allows users to borrow loans up to $1 million while using Bitcoin as collateral. Moreover, there’s no credit check for borrowers.

Now Marco Santori, the company's chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
