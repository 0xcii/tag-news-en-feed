Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Is Near Perfect For All Groups
 
In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the accumulation and distribution trends among the different BTC cohorts. The relevant indicator here is the “Accumulation Trend Score,” which keeps track of the behavior that the Bitcoin investors are showing right now.
 
The metric does so by tracking the 30-day changes in the balances of the holders. The indicator also takes into account the size of the entities when looking for accumulation and distribution behaviors.
 
 
When the indicator’s value is close to 1, it means that the BTC group of focus h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine predicting Bitcoin's death on a website that no longer exists.
That's what blogger Sean Lynch did 13 years ago today, when he wrote what 99 Bitcoins now classifies as the world's first "Bitcoin obituary," a news article that predicted the cryptocurrency's death or demise.
The post, titled "Why Bitcoin can’t be a currency," argued that Bitcoin lacked the mechanisms to handle fluctuations in demand, which would lead it to become worthless over time. He wrote: 
"In nature, positive feedback loops like exist with Bitcoin are lethal; the only thing that’s even kept Bitcoin alive this long is its novelty. Either it will remain a novelty forever or it will transition from novelty status to dead faster than you can blink."
Since then, Bitcoin, the world's most famous cryptocurrency, has defied critics and naysayers like Lynch, surging an astonishing 15 million percent in value since. Indeed, Bitcoin has consistently defied the odds, transforming from a niche experiment into a global financial phenomenon.
Still, the post, unearthed today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo is notable for proving just how wrong Bitcoin critics can be, with Lynch specifically arguing that economies need intervention and that Bitcoin would fail because it lacked it.
"The reason this can’t happen with government currencies is that government currencies *are* backed," he wrote. "They’re backed by bullets. If demand for USD starts to fall faster than the USG would like, the USG can just raise taxes without increasing spending, increasing demand and reducing supply simultaneously. There’s a bunch of stuff the FED can do, of course, and the FED tends to act first, but its operations are harder to explain. This is obviously not a perfect mechanism, since bubbles are still blown and popped, but even this mechanism is not available with Bitcoin."
Today, more and more people are seeing just how destructive that intervention can be, with central banks struggling to contain inflation around the globe.]]></summary>

Bitwala, a cryptocurrency service

rules for the regulation of cryptocurrency and stablecoin markets. The European  
Banking Authority (EBA) has proposed minimum capital and liquidity requirements  
for issuers of stablecoins and other digitized tokens.
The EBA's proposal, published today (Wednesday), is  
designed to ensure that issuers of stablecoins backed by currencies have  
sufficient funds for investors to redeem in case of losses. This move aims to  
establish a framework for the stablecoin industry and provide safeguards  
against potential crises.
Key to the proposed regulations is the requirement  
for issuers to maintain liquidity for the reserve of assets that back the  
stablecoin reserves. These assets must meet specific criteria, ensuring their

 This is a two-way process, in which crypto organizations make an effort towards compliance, while financial authorities and political bodies tailor regulations to meet the unique characteristics of blockchain development. This movement from the authorities towards understanding and incorporating crypto is most apparent in the EU, through MiCA: a work in progress, but still, the world’s first comprehensive framework for meaningful crypto regulation.
