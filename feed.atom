Malaysia Prepares to Trade With China in National Currencies, Limit Reliance on Dollar
 
China is open to talks with Malaysia on a decades old proposal to set up an Asian Monetary Fund that can reduce reliance on the U.S. currency, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced, quoted by Bloomberg.

This is an opinion editorial by David Seroy, founder and president of Old North Capital Fund and a contributor to the Sovryn protocol.
It is this author's opinion that over-collateralized, bitcoin-backed stablecoins issued on “DeFi” rails will become a highly-demanded and integral part of the Bitcoin economy in both developed and developing countries.
Bitcoin, Deficits And Taxation
Bitcoin as a hedge against monetary debasement is only half the battle. As sovereign debt goes parabolic, rate hikes become unviable without breaking the economy. Instead, it seems probable that governments will use taxation to quell inflation and reduce deficits…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-04-05T13:10:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin broke out of a resistance level of $28,500 on April 5, as crypto markets continued to react to economic data from the United States. Job openings in the U.S. fell below 10 million for the first time since 2021, which comes as employers began to reduce hiring efforts. Ethereum moved closer to $2,000, hitting a fresh eight-month high today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a key resistance level on Wednesday, with traders now targeting a move beyond the $29,000 mark.
 
Following a low of $27,979.75 on Tuesday, BTC/USD moved to an intraday high of $28,739.24 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw bitcoin climb above a recent ceiling of $28,500, hitting a four-day high in the process.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, it appears that the move occurred once the relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a recent floor at 58.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 62.48, with the next visible ceiling of 65.00 a possible target for bulls.
 
There is a strong possibility that BTC will be above $29,000 if and when this resistance point is hit.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also in the green, with prices climbing to a fresh eight-month high.
 
ETH/USD moved to a high of $1,921.27 earlier in the day, which comes a day after trading at a low of $1,855.37.
 
As a result of this rally, ethereum went back to its strongest point since August 17, when price hit a peak of $1,957.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This latest surge has pushed price strength to a current reading of 65.87, which is marginally below a ceiling at 66.00.
 
Due to this, some earlier bulls have moved to take profits, which has led to ETH falling from the day’s high.
 
At the time of writing, ethereum is trading at $1,915.88.

SHIB : The Metaverse is among the most anticipated projects on Shibarium and will contribute to boosting the SHIB price.
 
Every time a user makes a transaction on the Shiba Inu Metaverse, a small amount of SHIB will be burned. If millions of SHIB army members are going to use the futuristic metaverse, the micro amounts could add up and substantially tighten the supply of SHIB.
 
So it’s no wonder that SHIB : The Metaverse is getting a lot of hype, even though relatively little is still known about it. However, that could change next week.

Ripple should embrace this prospect wholeheartedly.

Ethereum Sharks Are Driving The Price
 
According to Santiment, Ethereum shark addresses may have been behind the recent rally. In a report posted to Twitter, Santiment reveals that these accounts holding between 100-10,000 coins have been accumulating ETH at an accelerated rate over the last nine months.
 
 
In total, these shark addresses added 2.27 million coins to their holdings which worked out to $4.2 billion. This accumulation pushed their holdings to a new one-year high…]]></summary>
