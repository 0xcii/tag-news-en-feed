Harnessing Visa’s Vast Experience and Global Reach
 
The South African crypto exchange Valr has partnered with the global payment card services corporation Visa to expand the use of crypto payments inside and outside the African country. The partnership arrangement means the two firms will collaborate on payment solutions that leverage the crypto exchange’s expertise and Visa’s capabilities.
 
Farzam Ehsani, the CEO and co-founder at Valr, lauded the partnership as a step that allows the crypto exchange to widen its range of products.
 
“Visa is a household name in payments, with vast experience and global reach. A partnership with Visa was a natural step for VALR as we bring more innovative products and services to our customer base,” Ehsani said.
 

 
Lineshree Moodley, the general manager for Visa South Africa, said the two companies would work on a solution that enables Valr customers to use the card firm’s network to make or receive payments.
 
For Valr, the announcement of the partnership with Visa represents another step in the crypto exchange’s endeavor to become a global digital asset platform. It also comes just under a month after the crypto exchange said it had commenced the process to acquire a license in the UAE.
