The collective market value of 81 distinct AI-focused cryptocurrency assets is on an upward trajectory. This growth comes on the heels of a slump the sector experienced on Jan. 22, 2024.

Based on current statistics and utilizing Bitcoin’s intended ten-minute block average, the fourth Bitcoin halving is just 78 days from today, scheduled for around April 21, 2024.
