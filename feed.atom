Ten years on, what was first created as a “joke” has gone on to become one of the largest cryptocurrencies with a large community to boot.

Engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer created Dogecoin, and interestingly, the duo is said to have created the meme coin as a parody of Bitcoin. It was created at a time when cryptocurrencies were just garnering hype and was done as a way to satirize them. That would explain why the Japanese Shiba Inu dog was chosen as the meme coin’s logo.
 
 
Upon creation, Dogecoin began to gain some ground in the world of cryptocurrencies as it was seen as the fun and less serious crypto token. Many might argue t…]]></summary>

with a staggering $90 million lost in a single day, compounding the $70 million  
in short liquidations the day prior. As the crypto market experiences rapid  
fluctuations, these developments underscore the challenges faced by those  
attempting to profit from potential price reversals.
Market Dynamics: Liquidations on the Rise
The surge in Bitcoin prices has triggered significant liquidations,  
particularly on exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Huobi. Large liquidations, a  
result of traders failing to meet margin requirements, provide crucial signals  
for market shifts. With trading volumes spiking by 25% and open interest  
reaching $20.2 billion, the market is navigating uncharted territories.

Over the course of history, different monetary systems have risen and fallen as technology progressed and new forms of money emerged that were superior to what came before. To help us understand money, we must examine the question: “who controls the ledger?” As we explore the technological history of money and its various incarnations, from informal social credit to commodity-backed systems, we can gain insight into how control over the monetary ledger impacts individual liberty, economic prosperity, and human flourishing. 
In the Austrian tradition, figures like Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, and many others have written extensively about the function of money. At its core, money enables in…]]></summary>

This appeal, first reported by Korean news outlet Digital Asset, follows the High Court of Podgorica’s decision to extradite Kwon, once one of the most influential figures in the crypto space, to either South Korea or the United States.
 
The appeal, lodged just two weeks after the High Court’s extradition approval, introduces significant uncertainty into the proceedings. The High Court, in its November 24 statement, had approved the extradition request made by South Korea and the United States but left the final determination of Kwon’s destination to the discretion of the Montenegrin Minister of Justice.
