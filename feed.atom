Experts speculate that the recent announcement by Canadian crypto payment gateway FCF Pay that it will support the three primary tokens of the Shiba Inu ecosystem (SHIB, LEASH, and BONE) on its prepaid Visa and Mastercard cards is also contributing to the rise of SHIB.

Since then, there have been multiple discussions and reports as both financial authorities weighed the potential benefits and risks a “digital pound” could bring to the UK economy. After 21 months of research and consultations, it would appear both parties have eventually come to a decision.
