Schwartz referred to McCaleb as a “crazy fool holding a live grenade” when discussing the differences between Ripple and Stellar. As expected, Schwartz’s recent comments have caused a stir in the cryptocurrency community, with almost 200,000 engagements. 
 
Controversy Between Ripple And Stellar
 
In an August 2022 tweet, a crypto influencer asked Ripple CTO his greatest criticism of Stellar. Schwartz didn’t respond, but McCaleb noted that the Stellar ledger threatens XRP. The comment from Stellar’s co-founder indicated that both parties were not on good terms.

PEPE‘s Meteoric Rise Hits a Roadblock with 12% Decline
 
Numerous investors reaped significant rewards from the surging PEPE meme token market; however, its worth has diminished from its all-time high (ATH). Just four days prior, on May 5, PEPE reached a pinnacle price of $0.00000431 per unit, but has since plunged over 50% from that position.

        <updated>2023-05-09T17:11:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Bitcoin exchange, Bull Bitcoin, has launched a new no-KYC (know-your-customer) service which enables users to buy bitcoin with cash or debit card. Users can go to any Canadian Post office, scan the QR code generated on the Bull Bitcoin app, and pay in cash or via debit card.
 
         
         
         
         
    
The funds are automatically added to the user's Bull Bitcoin account within a few minutes. Transactions of up to ~$745 ($999.99 CAD) can be made per transaction, with no KYC required. The exchange has a fee of 2% for no-KYC sats, the cheapest of any such service in Canada, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, while Bull Bitcoin's on-chain withdrawals remain free.
Canadian regulations state that Bitcoin exchanges must perform KYC and keep transaction records for all purchases above $1,000 CAD. Bull Bitcoin states that its privacy policy complies with the fair information principles in the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act (PIPEDA), which prevents it from collecting information that is not needed for a legitimate purpose. 
With no risk of chargeback for cash and debit card transactions, the company states that it has no legitimate reason to ask for KYC.
Bull Bitcoin aims to offer cash bitcoin purchases due to customer demand, and for those without access to bank accounts. The company also aims to attract migrant workers for remittances and users who want to limit the amount of personal information they give to trusted third parties. In addition, cash and debit card transactions are not subject to fraudulent chargebacks, unlike bank transfers and e-transfers. The process of funding accounts with cash or debit cards is also faster and more convenient.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The number of crypto companies in Estonia has drastically dropped due to changes in regulatory laws. Recently, the country’s money laundering regulator, the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) released, introduced stringent regulatory checks that led to the voluntary shutdown of several crypto firms. 
 
The regulator also withdrew some licenses from VASPs. The outcome of such a move is yet unknown, but it’ll filter out the crypto businesses from the country.
 
Estonia Implemented New Crypto Regulatory Rules
 
The FIU released a statement regarding the impact of amendments on some regulatory laws in March 2023. The amendment cut across Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Terrorist Financing Prevention laws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, the Bitcoin community has been abuzz with discussions about the network’s scaling challenges. As the blockchain’s transfer fees continue to surge, the backlog of transactions stuck in the mempool has hit an unprecedented high. Crypto enthusiasts have been sharing their diverse perspectives on the matter, leading to a flurry of takes across various social media platforms.
 
Bitcoin’s Scaling Challenges Spark Controversy and Diverse Perspectives
 
The recent surge in Ordinals and BRC20 token usage has led to a significant increase in onchain activity, causing the mempool to overflow with over 400,000 transactions. Currently, a whopping 194 blocks need to be mined to clear the backlog, which would take more than 24 hours at an average of ten minutes per block. As a result, people h…]]></summary>

While supporters argue that BRC20 tokens are a groundbreaking innovation from which the network will benefit in the long run due to rising transaction fees to finance miners, critics see a DDoS attack as the mempool is flooded with low-value transactions, effectively to speculate with sh*tcoins.
 
Is Bitcoin Under Attack?
 
The latter party includes John W. Ratcliff, a renowned video game programmer and Bitcoin OG. Ratcliff wrote today via Twitter that based on the way BRC20 tokens are coded, it is clearly an attack on Bitcoin.

"There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>

And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>
