However, as recent revelations suggest, this acclaimed crypto platform may soon change hands, causing a stir in the crypto community.
 
Particularly, Bloomberg has revealed that BC Technology Group Ltd. is mulling over the potential sale of its celebrated crypto platform, OSL. It’s worth noting that OSL is one of the duo of exchanges privileged with a license according to the digital-asset guidelines introduced by the city in June.

Paul Tudor Jones 3 Trades
Bitcoin, Ethereum and BNB

Last week, I wrote about The Bitcoin-Gold-China Connection. I pointed to the recent bitcoin and gold indirect correlation, but also to several interesting correlations between the three assets.

So when you decided to shut down zaps on Damus it came as a shock to someone who always appreciated Apple’s rebel spirit. Removing zaps from the iOS store does not stop me from zapping. It just makes me zap in a web browser instead. Reconsider what zaps can do for your business so you don’t miss the forest for the trees.

Ordinals exposed a fault line starting to form within the Bitcoin community. The ossifiers class that wants to keep Bitcoin the way it is versus the builders that want to explore and create new use cases for Bitcoin has turned into two distinct camps that will never reconcile their differences.
This has yet to happen with the NOSTR protocol. Capital has been pouring into development from some of the most well-known entities in Bitcoin. Primal, a nostr-focused client, recently secured $1 million in funding from Ten31 and Hivemind. Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter, has pledged $10 million to spur the development of the nostr protocol. De…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Helps El Salvador Rise From The Economic Ashes?
 
Felix Ulloa, Vice President of El Salvador, recently shared new details about the country’s progress with the Bitcoin Law following its second anniversary. The interview was published by Forbes and conducted by Javier Bastardo and touched on several key and controversial points.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The competition between Ripple and Ethereum has been a long-running one given the capabilities of both networks. This was further exacerbated by the fact that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chose to bring a lawsuit against Ripple over XRP being allegedly a security but the same was not done about Ethereum’s ETH token.
 
Both communities have since been at loggerheads with each one trying to prove that they’re better than the other. As a result of this, a video from 2014 has been dug up where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin seems to be praising Ripple.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the wake of fabricated news asserting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lit Blackrock’s Ishares spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, short positions worth $78.92 million were cleared out. This sum represented 57% of the overall $136.29 million in short positions erased in the last 24 hours.
 
Misleading Report on SEC Decision Shakes Bitcoin Market, Erasing Millions in Short Bets
 
On Monday, the crypto-focused media outlet Cointelegraph disseminated false information via social media platform X and its Telegram channel, triggering a more than 10% spike in bitcoin (BTC) value against the U.S. dollar.
 
The digital currency briefly touched $29,900 per coin before plunging to $28,100 per unit once the news was debunked. Cointelegraph, despite issuing an apology, was too late to prevent the market upheaval that resulted in the obliteration of $78.92 million worth of short positions.
 

 
Data from Coinglass reveals that in the past four hours, BTC short positions accounted for $71.36 million of the liquidated shorts. Around $2.49 million in Solana (SOL) short positions were also liquidated, among others.
 
The $78.92 million represented a staggering 57% of the day’s total short positions liquidated in the last 24 hours. In the same four-hour timeframe, long positions in Ethereum (ETH) exceeding $18 million were also liquidated.
 
 
Following the exposure of the counterfeit news, short positions on Bitfinex dropped drastically. Concurrently, long positions on Bitfinex saw a surge before the false news was confirmed, but have since declined.
 
The fallacious news event led to a significant number of traders being liquidated, potentially deflating the speculation surrounding the actual decision. The most substantial liquidations came from BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, and SOL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash was a huge gainer on Monday, as the cryptocurrency rallied by as much as 14% in today’s session. The surge comes after Cointelegraph falsely suggested that Blackrock’s bitcoin ETF was approved by the SEC. An apology has since been issued, following the mistaken report. Solana also hit a multi-week high on the news.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash was already ahead of the pack Monday, and then rose by as much as 14% in today’s session, after it was alleged by Cointelegraph that Blackrock’s bitcoin ETF was approved by the SEC.
 
The tweet has since been removed, with an apology being issued by the company for the mistake.
 
BCH/USD peaked at $242.77 following the news, however it has since slipped, and is now trading at $229.43.
 
 
Despite retreating from earlier highs, the cryptocurrency remains over 8% higher than Sunday’s low of $213.10.
 
One catalyst for the rise was a breakout which occurred on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 
Price strength moved past a ceiling at the 55.00 mark, and as of writing is tracking at 56.44.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) neared the $25.00 level to start the week, as bulls pushed price to a 14-day high.
 
After trading at a low of $21.71 on Sunday, SOL/USD raced to a peak of $24.41 earlier in today’s session.
 
This resulted in SOL hitting its highest level since October 2, however momentum has since shifted, with price now at $23.34.
 
 
Like with BCH above, a glide beyond a resistance zone appears to have been the signal bulls were waiting for to enter the market.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 61.79, which comes following a surge past the aforementioned ceiling at 60.00.
