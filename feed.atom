Will Ethereum Fail Because Of Its Ideology?
 
Gaevoy’s remarks followed comments from Hayden Adams, known for his pioneering work on the Uniswap protocol, who had earlier expressed his tolerance and perceived value in meme-centric cryptocurrencies, emphasizing their role in promoting social causes. “I think there’s value to memetic attention and it’s cool to creat…]]></summary>
