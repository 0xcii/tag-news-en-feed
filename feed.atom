Bill Gross Foresees Economic Clouds on the Horizon
 
On Tuesday, October 24, 2023, stock markets have risen, somewhat healing from the previous week’s bruises. Despite this uptick, market conditions remain tumultuous, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield hovering at 4.84%.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now Pointing At “Greed”
 
The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator that tells us about the sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market. The index was created by Alternative and it takes into account the following factors: volatility, volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends.
 
The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100 to represent the sentiment. When the indicator has a value greater than 54, it means that the investors share a majority sentiment of greed right now.

Crypto whales, a term used to describe individuals or entities that hold large amounts of cryptocurrencies, have notably contributed to a significant upsurge in SHIB tokens within their wallets. 
 
According to data provided by IntoTheBlock, SHIB whales amassed a staggering 4.52 trillion SHIB tokens, marking an astonishing 2,300% increase from the figures observed on Friday.
