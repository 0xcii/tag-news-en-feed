SEC Chairman Under Fire For Crypto Crackdown
 
Mark Cuban recently joined two podcasts on Thursday to discuss industry-related topics, including the US elections, crypto adoption, and the SEC’s regulatory stance.

In an interview with Farokh Sarmad, Cuban reiterated his long-standing discontent with the Commission, asserting he is a “big fan of bright line regulation” rather than “regulat…]]></summary>

The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission are appealing to the Supreme Court to revive a case that accuses Nvidia Corp. of misleading investors about its revenue from cryptocurrency mining.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price action in the past two weeks has reiterated its volatile nature despite the steady flow of institutional money. The cryptocurrency surged in the last days of September from $53,500 to a high of $66,000, only to pull back to $61,000 in the first few days of October, showing its unpredictable nature. 
 
Interestingly, Bitcoin’s rally to reaching $66,000 has led to a change in the investing dynamics among holder cohorts. Furthermore, this change in dynamics reveals that its reversal and retest after the rally is not entirely bad news for Bitcoin’s price. In fact, this shift suggests that the pullback could be setting the stage for a more resilient long-term price outlook for Bitcoin.
