last few months, investor sentiment towards individual cryptocurrencies has  
favored Ethereum (ETH) over Bitcoin (BTC). However, the release of the  
first-ever spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for BTC has changed the balance of  
market forces, and now there is a much more bullish positioning towards the

Europeans Show Greater  
Interest in Bitcoin over Ethereum
Spectrum  
Markets, a pan-European trading venue, released data showing diverging  
sentiment among retail investors regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum

Hoskinson specifically highlighted the dominance of a few top companies in the Bitcoin and stablecoin sectors, arguing that this poses risks to users and undermines the decentralized nature of crypto.
 
 
Centralization Of Stablecoins
 
Hoskinson pointed out that asset-backed stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), control a significant portion of the stablecoin market. He noted that USDT and USDC alone account for 70% of on-chain volume while representing only 10% of the entire crypto industry.

According to Elliptic, on February 9, an unauthorized wallet managed to “mint” 200 million PLA tokens, worth approximately $36.5 million. This breach was believed to result from a compromise of a private key. 
 
 
In an attempt to recover the stolen funds, PlayDapp sent a message to the exploiter through an on-chain transaction, offering a $1 million “white hat reward” if the stolen funds were returned by February 13. The message reads:…]]></summary>
