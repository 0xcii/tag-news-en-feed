        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it's  
too early to talk about a speculative cryptocurrency rally like the ones  
Bitcoin (BTC) has historically offered, something is definitely going on. Just  
yesterday (Monday), the price of the oldest cryptocurrency surged by 15%,  
testing its highest levels since May 2022, or in 17 months. 
Along with  
the rising price, investor expectations and dreams are also soaring, with some  
already mentally cashing in above-average profits. The fear-of-missing-out  
(FOMO) sentiment is also making a definitive comeback in the bull market.
Bitcoin Priced at $35,000:

During  
Tuesday's Asian trading session, Bitcoin momentarily tested the $35,200 level,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price has risen above $35,000 for the first time since early May 2022, for which there are a number of reasons beyond mere speculation. These are the five most important reasons.
 
#1 BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Looms Large
 
The primary driver behind the surge seems to be the growing anticipation surrounding the possible green light for a Spot Bitcoin ETF. The epicenter of this surge is the potential approval of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF.
 
Fueling these speculations was a revelation from Scott Johnsson, a respected finance lawyer from Davis Polk. He noted, “So two things caught my eye from the latest iShares (Blackrock) S-1 amendment: They’ve obtained a CUSIP in preparation for a launch. They may be looking to seed with cash this month.”

Egypt’s Worsening Debt Affordability
 
Egypt, one of Africa’s heavily indebted countries, recently issued Chinese currency denominated bonds worth an estimated $479 million or 3.5 billion yuan.

Volume tends to jump at these points suggesting that there is a high degree of interest in the altcoin. This means that as XRP tokens go on the market, there are eager investors waiting to pick up on this available supply and defend the price.
