This is not so dissimilar from the concept of drivechains enabled a wider network of sidechains, rather than a singular one.

JUST IN: Wells Fargo and Bank of America’s Merrill are offering spot #Bitcoin ETFs to wealth clients 🚀 pic.twitter.com/Lr3oD5XgrR
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) February 29, 2024
  
  
  
The move by these banks reflects the growing interest among investors in gaining exposure to Bitcoin. Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo are providing access to approved Bitcoin ETFs to select wealth management clients with brokerage accounts upon request, according to individuals familiar with the matter.
This development comes after spot Bitcoin ETFs had a record setting week in the US, with inflows of BlackRock's ETF hitting $612 million yesterday. The decision by Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo to offer these ETFs demonstrates their recognition of the increasing demand for Bitcoin investment options among their affluent clientele.
By providing access to Bitcoin ETFs, these banks are catering to the evolving investment preferences of their clients, who are seeking opportunities to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the growth potential of Bitcoin. The availability of Bitcoin exposure through mainstream financial institutions like Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo further legitimizes the Bitcoin market and underscores its integration into traditional finance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock's spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is poised to make its debut in Brazil tomorrow, according to a report from the largest financial market news platform in Brazil, InfoMoney. The launch follows the announcement by BlackRock that the Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs) of its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT39) will begin trading on B3, Brazil's stock exchange, on Friday, according to the report.
“Our digital asset journey has been underpinned by the goal of providing high-quality access vehicles to investors,” said Karina Saade, president of BlackRock in Brazil. “IBIT39 is a natural progression of our efforts over many years and builds on the fundamental capabilities we have established so far in the digital asset market.”
IBIT39 will initially be available to qualified investors, with retail access expected to follow in the coming "weeks." The management fee for IBIT39 is set at 0.25%, with a one-year waiver and a reduction to 0.12% after reaching $5 billion in assets under management.
In the United States, where Bitcoin spot ETFs were cleared by regulators in January, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has emerged as the most popular option, accumulating over $9 billion in assets since launch. According to Bloomberg data, BlackRock's ETF attracted a record $612 million of inflows in a single day yesterday.
Despite the success of Bitcoin ETFs, Saade emphasized that BlackRock's launch in Brazil and the United States does not constitute an endorsement of Bitcoin itself but rather a recognition of its relevance as an asset class. “Our goal is to serve our customers with safe and transparent products. We have no recommendation or any expectations regarding Bitcoin itself,” Saade explained.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a Reuters report, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised concerns regarding Terraform Labs’ hiring of the law firm Dentons and the payment of litigation costs for its employees during the company’s bankruptcy proceedings. 
 
The SEC argues that a $166 million retainer payment made to Terraform Labs’s lawyers may have been an attempt to evade a potential judgment in the SEC’s fraud lawsuit against the company.
 
Bankrupt Terraform Labs Accused Of Misusing Funds
 
Per the report, Terraform Labs has transferred $166 million to Dentons since the beginning of 2023, allegedly diverting these funds into an “opaque slush fund for its lawyers.” The SEC claims this action has disadvantaged the investors and creditors seeking repayment in Terraform’s bankruptcy case.
