Milei, who identifies as an anarcho-capitalist, has expressed his intention to dismantle the political “caste” which he accuses of failing the nation, boldly asserting earlier this year that the state “destroys wealth.”
 
Milei Triumphs in Argentina’s Presidential Race
 
At 53, the libertarian economist Javier Milei has claimed victory over the left-leaning finance minister Sergio Massa to become Argentina’s president. In a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, Milei, an advocate of free-market capitalism, attributed Argentina’s economic challenges to its century of socialist policies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Late Sunday night, it was confirmed that Bitcoin friendly candidate Javier Milei officially won Argentina's presidential election, beating his opponent Sergio Massa by 2,786,457 votes. The new president will now take office on December 10.
 
         
         
         
        
Bloomberg
 
    
While Milei has not yet advocated for Bitcoin to be used as legal tender or to hold BTC as a reserve asset, he does has plans to scrape the Argentine peso and replace it with the US dollar. Last Monday, the Argentine peso saw its hyperinflation rise to 143% and growing, leaving the nation financially ruined and in desperate need of change.
Earlier this year, hundreds of Argentines gathered in support of Bitcoin, forming the shape of a giant BTC symbol to protest the rampant inflation plaguing the country.



The new president of Argentina has been very vocal about his criticisms of central banking, previously stating "The central bank is a scam, a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax.” After that he commented on Bitcoin, saying that it "represents the return of money to its original creator, the private sector,” and that "it prevents politicians from robbing you through inflation."
He has also featured on a TV show in the past, mercilessly beating a piñata of a central bank with a stick.



While the future of Bitcoin remains uncertain in Argentina at the moment, Javier Milei being sworn into office is hopefully one step closer to the country joining El Salvador in officially adopting Bitcoin as legal tender and holding it as a reserve asset.]]></summary>

This development comes following the heavy criticism of the wider tech community on the board’s decision to abruptly fire the Worldcoin founder.
 
In a shocking statement on Friday, OpenAI announced Altman would be leaving the company, citing a loss of confidence caused by a lack of honesty in the CEO’s exchanges with the board. 
 
This dismissal was ill-received by many within and outside the OpenAI community. Greg Brockman, the company’s president, was the first to resign in reaction to the board’s decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greenidge Generation Holdings has successfully wiped out $21.8 million in secured debt and divested its South Carolina bitcoin mining facility to NYDIG. The firm detailed that the move enhances Greenidge’s financial stability and liquidity.
 
Greenidge Generation Holdings Clears $21.8 Million Debt, Sells Mining Site to NYDIG
 
On Wednesday, Greenidge finalized the sale of a 22-acre mining site with 44 megawatts (MW) of capacity in Spartanburg, SC, to NYDIG. This deal marks the resolution of all outstanding secured debts Greenidge owed to the bitcoin asset management firm.
 
In 2023, Greenidge achieved a reduction in its financial obligations, slashing $85.3 million from its debt. This substantial repayment accounts for more than half — specifically, over 54% — of its total debt.
 
However, the company continues to manage $72 million in unsecured debt, due in 2026. The agreement entitles Greenidge to an approximate $6.2 million cash payout. Moreover, the company retains around 153 acres in Spartanburg, earmarked for potential expansion into data centers.
 
NYDIG, operating under the umbrella of Stone Ridge Holdings Group, provides a spectrum of services including bitcoin (BTC) custody, financial solutions, infrastructure, and BTC mining operations. Acquiring this facility allows NYDIG to further integrate its mining operations with enhanced infrastructure.
 
 
Over the last two years, several cryptocurrency miners incurred substantial debts to NYDIG due to loans taken out to support their mining ventures. These loans were secured during a bullish market period, characterized by high profitability.
 
Nonetheless, the transition to a bear market posed challenges for some of these miners in repaying their debts. Companies including Core Scientific and Iris Energy are among those that held rig-backed loans from the firm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on a recent report, Jump Trading Group, known for its focus on algorithmic and high-frequency trading techniques, has reportedly severed ties with the Wormhole crypto initiative, known for its cross-chain communication services. Last year saw Wormhole suffer a significant loss of 120,000 ethereum due to a major security incident.
 
Wormhole and Jump Trading ‘Part Ways’
 
Recent developments indicate that Jump Trading and Wormhole have “parted ways,” as per a Bloomberg article quoting “people with knowledge of the matter.” The account further reveals that former Jump executives Saeed Badreg and Anthony Ramirez have allegedly departed to manage Wormhole independently.
 
Confidential informants, preferring anonymity, have disclosed that following this division, Jump’s workforce has been reduced to about 75 staffers, which is nearly half of what it was at its peak in 2022. In February 2022, Wormhole suffered a major breach and lost 120,000 ether from the exploit.
 
Following the incident, Jump stepped in and replaced the $320 million worth of ether that was stolen. “All funds have been restored and Wormhole is back up,” the team said at the time. “We’re deeply grateful for your support and thank you for your patience. The team is working on a detailed incident report and will share it ASAP.”
 
 
Based on data from dappradar.com, Wormhole has processed transactions totaling $230.48 million over a 30-day period, spanning seven distinct blockchains. Although unnamed informants have disclosed the information, Jump has yet to make a public statement on the issue.
