As first covered in Bitcoin Magazine on April 6, Buncombe County, North Carolina proposed a one-year moratorium on bitcoin mining and held a public hearing on May 2.
The text of the proposal stated that the moratorium, if approved, would go into effect the same day as the hearing, so it was readily apparent that the County Commission was simply following procedure when taking comments from the public.

MoonPay, a cryptocurrency infrastructure company, has launched its app in over 130 countries, offering more than 5 million claimed users a streamlined multi-wallet management solution. The app, which had a soft launch in March to 15,000 early access users, is now available to MoonPay users on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
“The all-in-one platform offers an easier way for Bitcoin holders to see their transactions, pricing history and top-up on the go, leading to a more informed and active community," said Ivan Soto-Wright, CEO and co-founder of MoonPay.
According to MoonPay, 55% of app users have successfully transacted with three or more wallets, while 25% have transacted with eight or more wallets, signifying the growing demand for a simplified multi-wallet management in-app experience.
"Our goal is to provide our millions of customers with a new way to engage with their cryptocurrencies and digital assets and provide the foundation for our leading brand partners and creators to continue their adoption," said Soto-Wright.
MoonPay previously partnered with BitPay to give BitPay users significantly “increased ways to buy cryptocurrency instantly.” Prior to that partnership, MoonPay joined forces with ZEBEDEE to offer the purchasing and selling of bitcoin for users of the ZEBEDEE platform. That partnership leveraged the Lightning Network in order to make transactions as seamless as possible.]]></summary>

Now Marco Santori, the company's chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
