        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum Insider Steven Nerayoff has threatened to release more evidence on the alleged irregularities involving the network. His comment suggests that this evidence could have far-reaching consequences as it will expose “criminals on a magnitude that is unprecedented.”
 
Nerayoff Promises To Expose Criminals Posed As Altruists
 
Nerayoff stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he was soon going to unveil “data” that unmasks certain criminals that are currently posing as “altruists.” He noted that he had made good on his earlier promise of the recording. As such, the crypto community can also be certain that he will make good on this one, too. 
 
 
It is uncertain who these “altruists” might be. However, Nerayoff could be alluding to Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin, as …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has responded to a recent statement by Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, with a sharp criticism of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Grewal questioned the SEC’s understanding of investment contracts in connection with cryptocurrencies.
 
He emphasized that the term “investments” does not inherently constitute “investment contracts” and pointed out that investment contracts must entail rights to the future income, profits, or assets of an enterprise. This view aligns with the SEC’s own stance in the Edwards case presented before the Supreme Court, where the SEC described investment contracts as having the character of “debt [or] equity participation.”

Currently there are many issues with seamless integration of Bitcoin to fiat exchanges inside of applications, chief among them being lack of Lightning support by many brokerages. In addition to that, each brokerage service in the market builds proprietary APIs for integration with their services, increasing the overhead of integration of multiple options by application and wallet developers. Breez SDK’s support for the FiatLink API can facilitate a single solution to both problems.

This approval will change the course of Bitcoin adoption for better or worse, and is a good reason to be warned of what is to come.
The Bitcoin ETF approval will send a huge message to money managers around the world, that is that “We, the US Government, deem bitcoin a safe asset for you to invest in”.

The prospective green light for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a hot topic, with traders mulling over whether it’ll catalyze a “buy the rumor sell the news” scenario or herald a significantly bullish turn.
 
Bitcoin
 
There’s a tangible sense of anticipation for the SEC’s verdict, believed by many to have been factored into the past quarter’s bitcoin price movements. Approval might initiate a temporary dip in BTC’s value as traders harvest profits, yet there remains a chance for an unexpected rally, potentially driving prices north of $50K.
