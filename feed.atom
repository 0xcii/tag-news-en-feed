This NFT was listed on the Arcade platform, where interested lenders could submit their loan offers. After reviewing the listed options, the borrower took a $35,000 loan from one of the listed offers.

This extended delay, eventually turning into a denial on January 27, 2023, raised concerns about potential biases favoring incumbent banks over disruptive newcomers like Custodia.
