        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the “Avalon Bitcoin & Crypto Day” conference in Singapore, the bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) manufacturer Canaan showcased its new Avalon-made 14 series mining rigs. One of the mining machines, the A1466I, boasts an energy efficiency of fewer than 20 joules per terahash (J/T), approximately 19.5 J/T, and has a production capacity of up to 170 terahash per second (TH/s).
 
Canaan’s Liquid-Cooled A1466I: A Game-Changer in Bitcoin Mining Efficiency
 
Canaan has officially unveiled its new Avalon series 14 miners after previously teasing the products last month. One of these miners features an efficiency rating below 20 J/T and offers an energy efficiency ratio of 19.5 J/T. This specific mining rig is the A1466I, which utilizes liquid cooling and produces up to 170 TH/s in terms of SHA256 hashrate output.
 
 
During the Canaan presentation at the event, the company highlighted the availability of two cooling options: submerged liquid-cooled and air-cooled models. The other Avalon 14 series miner, the A1466, is air-cooled and boasts a hashrate of 150 TH/s with an energy efficiency ratio of 21.5 J/T. The Vice President of Canaan, Davis Hui, delivered the presentation onstage, marking Canaan’s 10th anniversary.
 
 
It’s noteworthy that Avalon-brand miners crafted by Canaan were the first ASIC bitcoin miners to be publicly sold in January 2013. However, while Canaan is the pioneer in introducing a machine with an efficiency rating below 20 J/T, its competitor Bitmain plans to launch its Antminer S21 line at the 2023 World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) in Hong Kong from September 22 to 23. According to Bitmain, the S21 will also feature an efficiency rating of 1X J/T.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash was one of Tuesday’s biggest movers, as bullish sentiment returned to markets, following recent declines. After huge losses on Monday, bulls have seemingly moved to buy the dip in price, pushing the global market cap 1.55% higher as of writing. Solana also surged in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) rose by as much as 6% on Tuesday, as bulls returned to the market following recent declines in price.
 
After falling to a low of $181.38 to start the week, BCH/USD raced to a peak of $198.93 earlier in the day.
 
This rally saw bitcoin cash snap a four-day losing streak, which pushed price close to a support level at $180.00.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that this was the trigger bulls needed in order to return to the market.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also bounced at a floor of its own at the 35.00 mark, and is now tracking at 37.58.
 
Should today’s momentum extend through the rest of the week, there is a good chance that BCH will rise towards a key resistance level of $220.00.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was also in the green during today’s session, as it rebounded from a recent multi-month low.
 
SOL/USD peaked at $18.66 on Tuesday, which comes a day after the token bottomed out at $17.46.
 
Monday’s low saw solana fall to its lowest point since June 30, when price was at a low of $17.12.
 
 
Earlier gains have somewhat faded, however, as bulls were unable to penetrate the ceiling at the $19.00 mark.
 
This has led to traders opting to secure their profits, instead of keeping positions open at this point of uncertainty.

        <updated>2023-09-12T15:00:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six years ago, in a now-famous CNBC interview, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon made headlines with scathing remarks about Bitcoin, calling the digital money system that transcends international borders a "fraud" that will "eventually blow up."
In September 2017, during a conference in New York, Dimon stated that Bitcoin was only suitable for "drug dealers and murderers." He would later take back the comments in 2018 after Bitcoin passed $20,000 that year.
At the time, the Bitcoin market was still in its infancy, and many traditional financial leaders viewed it with skepticism. Dimon's comments would reverberate through the financial world, but little did he know that his words would come back to haunt him.
Fast forward six years, and the tables have turned dramatically. Bitcoin has not only survived but thrived, becoming a legitimate asset class and a household name. Its price has skyrocketed, making early investors fortunes and attracting institutional interest. Bitcoin's market capitalization has surged, and it has gained widespread acceptance as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.
In the years following Dimon's comments, Bitcoin defied all odds and surged in value, rising over 500%. Bitcoin was trading at just over $4,000 at the time of the comments, but trades routinely at above $25,000 today.
As Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo commented on X today, the comments stand in stark contrast given Wall Street's recent reversal on Bitcoin, with top firms including Blackrock and Fidelity filing for spot Bitcoin ETFs.
