        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exactly 14 years after Bitcoin was born through the Genesis block, Proof of Keys Day helps us remember why the protocol was invented and where we are today.
14 years ago today, Satoshi Nakamoto created the first block in the Bitcoin blockchain. Whether consciously or not, that move kickstarted an entire movement; one that keeps on breathing and expanding these many years afterwards. The singularity of Nakamoto’s creation has been put on display countless times since the Genesis block was mined, and today, more than ever, its purpose is becoming more clear and, fortunately or not, needed.
Engraved in the Genesis block is Bitcoin’s raison d'être.
