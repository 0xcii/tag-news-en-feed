exchange FTX, which he co-founded, crumbled. 
BBC reported that the 31-year-old entrepreneur,  
accused of deceiving investors and embezzling customer funds, opened up about  
his actions and decisions that led to this point. "A lot of people got  
hurt, customers, employees, and the company ended up in bankruptcy," he  
added.
Throughout his testimony at the Manhattan federal  
court, SBF admitted to making a series of errors, both minor and significant,  
while managing the now-defunct exchange. He identified the absence of a  
dedicated risk management team as one of his most critical oversights.
