On Wednesday, the Chicago Bulls star Pippen took to his more-than-674,400 X (previously Twitter) followers and said: “Bullish on Bitcoin” with the hashtag #BeLikeSatoshi.
 
 
Since then, this has become a hot topic of discussion among his supporters within the cryptocurrency sphere.
 
Pippen’s Bitcoin Dream And Price Predictions
 
What is even more interesting in Pippen’s statements are the fact that he related them to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin.
 
In the earlier tweet, Pippen seemed to have claimed that in one dream, Satoshi projected the price of Bitcoin would touch $84,650 on November 5, 2024.
