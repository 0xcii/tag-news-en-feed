        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Su Zhu, a founding member of the now-insolvent Three Arrows Capital, was apprehended in Singapore at Changi Airport on Friday, as per the firm’s liquidator, Teneo. Zhu received a four-month prison sentence for failing to cooperate in the bankruptcy proceedings, Teneo revealed.
 
Crackdown at Changi Airport: 3AC’s Su Zhu Detained, Associate Kyle Davies Fugitive
 
Teneo, overseeing the liquidation of Three Arrows Capital, reported that co-founder Su Zhu was seized and sentenced to four months’ incarceration. His associate, Kyle Davies, remains at large; however, Teneo confirmed he was given an identical penalty.
 
Zhu allegedly tried to flee Singapore when he was intercepted at Changi Airport, situated approximately 25 miles east of Singapore’s Downtown Core. The Singapore court decreed that Zhu and Davies had not been collaborating with the liquidation procedure – an issue previously reported by the media months prior to his apprehension.
 
 
The defunct Singapore-based cryptocurrency hedge fund once supervised over $10 billion in assets at its height. However, a confluence of perilous trading tactics, Terra’s collapse, and plummeting cryptocurrency values obliterated the firm’s assets. Consequently, 3AC declared bankruptcy and was mandated to liquidate by a British Virgin Islands court on June 27, 2022.
 
Squawk Box posted on X that Kyle Davies, the co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, was asked if he was in Bali because Indonesia is one of seven countries that will not extradite him to the United States. While that interview was in November 2022, Davies is believed to be still in Bali.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin traders and enthusiasts have been eagerly anticipating the next significant move in the cryptocurrency market, with memories of the 2019 fakeout rally still fresh in their minds. 
 
However, one prominent BTC trader, known as Dave the Wave on the social media platform X, is offering a reassuring perspective. According to Dave, the conditions that led to the 2019 fakeout rally are unlikely to repeat themselves in the current market cycle.
 
The 2019 fakeout rally left many Bitcoin investors disappointed. It was characterized by a sudden breakout that sent BTC prices soaring, only to see them crash back down just as rapidly.
 
 
This roller-coaster ride was attributed to Bitcoin spending only a short time in the “buy zone” before experiencing the wild price swings.

The only concrete part of the protocol idea specified was how to handle token movement and allocations. It is a very simple proposal using OP_RETURN in each transaction to facilitate assigning tokens to a specific UTXO with an output index, a token amount field, and a token ID number. That's it.

A total of 43 mining pools channel their hashpower at the Bitcoin blockchain, yet, it’s Foundry USA’s pool that ruled the roost this month, seizing a 29.36% share of the total hashrate over the past 30 days.
 
Bitcoin Miners Unfazed: Hashrate Remains Strong Despite Soaring Difficulty
 
The forthcoming difficulty adjustment, slated for October 3, 2023, looms, yet the climb to a formidable 57.12 trillion in difficulty hasn’t swayed miners. Metrics spanning seven days signal that the hashrate has averaged at a robust 417 EH/s, especially after cresting to an all-time high (433 EH/s) on September 19 concerning seven-day averages.

Ripple, the company behind XRP, recently introduced a “Clawback” amendment to the XRP Ledger, which would allow issuers to maintain control over their issued assets.
 
Background Of The Rumor
 
Rumors are very rampant in the crypto industry, and the XRP Ledger has emerged as the latest victim. Developers recently introduced an XLS-39d Clawback mechanism in the XRP Ledger which would allow issuers to regain funds from a trustline in case of malicious activity. This feature has caused confusion and rumors about whether it applies to the XRP price.

Today (Friday) afternoon at Changi Airport in Singapore, Zhu was

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of Bitcoin mining, the concept of decentralization versus centralization has been a subject of ongoing debate. 
 
Recent data from Hash Index has shed new light on this discussion by revealing that public miners make up just 28% of Bitcoin’s global hash rate. This statistic challenges the notion that miners hold central control over the network, emphasizing the pivotal role of nodes in the ecosystem.
 
 
While this data showcases the influence of public miners, it’s crucial to acknowledge that potential centralization points still exist within mining pools. Approximately 70% of the network’s hash rate is driven by private entities, as reported by Hashrate Index. 
 
 
According to @hashindex, public miners are 28% of #Bitcoin‘s global hashrate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was one of Friday’s notable crypto gainers, rallying to a one-month high earlier in today’s session. Bullish sentiment returned to end the week, with the global market cap trading nearly 1.5% higher as of writing. Solana also surged, moving back above the $20.00 mark.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was one of today’s biggest movers, climbing by as much as 5% earlier in the day.
 
Following a low of $0.5036 yesterday, XRP/USD raced to a peak of $0.5455 during Friday’s session.
 
This resulted in the token hitting its highest point since August 29, which is the last time price hit a ceiling of $0.5490.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that the move came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose beyond a ceiling of its own at 56.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 58.67, with the next visible point of support near the 60.00 mark.
 
In the event the 60.00 ceiling is broken, there is a good chance that XRP will climb beyond $0.5500.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
In addition to XRP, solana (SOL) also rallied strongly on Friday, rising above $20.00 in the process.
 
SOL/USD climbed to a high of $20.32 earlier in today’s session, following Thursday’s low at $19.22.
 
This surge has seen solana hit a nine-day high, which comes after three straight days of bullish momentum.
 
 
Overall, the uptrend comes as the 10-day (red) moving average rose above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Bulls are likely now targeting a higher resistance level of $21.00, which would result in a four-week high.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry, Su Zhu, co-founder of the failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), was arrested at Changi Airport in Singapore while attempting to leave the country. 
 
Zhu’s arrest led to a subsequent court order sentencing him to four months in prison, as confirmed by 3AC’s joint liquidator, Teneo.
 
 
Three Arrows Capital Co-Founder Apprehended 
 
According to reports, While Zhu now serves his prison term, the liquidators will actively engage with him to address matters concerning Three Arrows Capital. 
 
Their primary focus will be on recovering assets belonging to 3AC or acquired using the fund’s resources. The liquidators seek to maximize returns for the hedge fund’s creditors and will initiate further court proceedings as necessary.
 
The arrest and subsequent sentencing of Zhu follow the earlier granting of a committal order on September 25. This order was obtained due to Zhu’s intentional non-compliance with a court directive that required his cooperation with the liquidators’ investigations. 
 
Specifically, Zhu was obligated to provide a detailed account of his activities as a co-founder of 3AC and its former investment manager.
 
A similar committal order was also issued against Kyle Davies, the other co-founder of Three Arrows Capital. However, Davies’ current whereabouts remain unknown, according to Teneo.
 
 
The liquidators have consistently prioritized the recovery of 3AC’s assets and maximized returns for its creditors throughout the process. Their efforts focus on retrieving 3AC’s property and assets acquired using the fund’s funds. 
 
Lastly, Teneo emphasized that they will continue to work diligently towards these objectives, potentially seeking additional court orders to facilitate the process.
