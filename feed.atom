Modularity is the result of a curious experiment playing out in Ethereum as a reaction to the poor scaling properties of blockchains. To address this bottleneck, developers have taken the radical approach of auctioning off core functions of the main chain to… other blockchains. 
Centered around rollup technology, this modular transformation has completely redefined how products and services are built on top of Ethereum. Breaking apart every element of the stack allows different architectures to be designed according to their use cases. Understandably this has led to a proliferation of… blockchains. 
I kid you not. Everyone is getting hilariously rich selling blockchains, again.
