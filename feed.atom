        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase Financial Markets (CFM) introduced regulated leveraged crypto futures for its U.S. customers Wednesday, now available to Coinbase Advanced users. The trading platform currently offers nano-sized contracts at one-hundredth of a bitcoin and one-tenth of an ethereum.
 
Coinbase Financial Markets Rolls Out Crypto Futures for U.S. Investors
 
The San Francisco-based crypto platform, Coinbase, is beginning to gradually introduce its bitcoin and ethereum futures offerings. CFM’s goal is to “make futures more accessible to retail crypto traders,” according to the announcement Wednesday. With the launch, Coinbase Advanced customers in the U.S. can now access the regulated crypto futures contracts
 
Coinbase explains that futures derivatives products allow traders to hedge risk and diversify. “Leverage in futures trading can work for you or against you. The risk of loss using leverage can exceed your initial investment amount,” the announcement discloses.
 
The exchange added:
 

These futures contracts are specifically sized for retail traders, at 1/100th of a bitcoin and 1/10th of an ethereum.
 
The company further explained that CFM’s approval to offer federally regulated crypto futures trading in August marked a critical milestone, signaling significant progress in the crypto trading domain. Coinbase also noted the pivotal role of education in CFM’s strategy, providing a suite of articles for traders covering a range of topics, from the basics of futures trading to the associated benefits and risks.
 
The firm’s stock (Nasdaq: COIN) is up 0.48% for the month and 58% over the past six months. Year-to-date, COIN has gained 111% against the U.S. dollar. Customers not using Coinbase Advanced can apply to trade futures with CFM, provided they pass the anti-money laundering/know-your-customer (AML/KYC) and verification processes.

Music Industry Misfortune
The music industry is notorious for preying on the artists on which its existence depends. In the early days of recorded music, this exploitation started with unfavorable contracts, depriving musicians of the fruits of their labor while record labels made all the money. The mistreatment has since evolved into the Live Nation Entertainment monopoly, where the company has a nearly exclusive hold on the ticket market (thanks, Ticketmaster!) and an equally tight grasp on the event side, where the company owned at least 259 venues worldwide as of 2021, and where many of their ticketed concerts are held.

Payments to the campaign can either be made on-chain or via lightning network transactions.
 
         
         
         
        Bitcoin Campaign Donations Accepted
Ted Cruz for Senate
 
    
Cruz has been a very vocal proponent of Bitcoin in the senate over the last few years, especially when it comes to the energy front, where he says the Bitcoin industry "is generating enormous benefits for Texas, for the country." 
The senator seemingly wants to help lead a charge on educating and bringing more Bitcoin awareness to his colleges in office, alerting that he has "real concern when it comes to congress," because he serves "in the U.S. senate, a body where I'm not sure we have 5 senators that can tell you what the hell a Bitcoin is."
This past April, the sitting senator attempted to bring more BTC awareness to DC as he featured in a fireside chat at the Bitcoin Policy Summit, revealing that he owns "a little more than 2 bitcoin, and every Monday I own a little bit more...I am incredibly bullish on Bitcoin specifically."



Cruz joins a growing list of US politicians starting to accept Bitcoin for campaign donations in 2023. Earlier this year, presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr and Vivek Ramaswamy both starting accepting BTC also through OpenNode for campaign donations.]]></summary>

El-Erian stated, “There have been two big puzzles. They show how unsettling the volatility in the US Treasuries have been. One is, you haven’t had it been the safe haven. We haven’t seen the flight to quality, and the flight to safety you would expect, given what is happening in the world.”
