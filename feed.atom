        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple, a leading blockchain and cryptocurrency company, has acquired Fortress Trust, a Nevada-licensed financial services provider for the crypto industry. The purchase expands Ripple’s regulatory licenses and infrastructure to bolster its position in enterprise blockchain solutions.
 
Ripple Acquires Fortress Trust
 
The acquisition provides Ripple with Fortress Trust’s financial, regulatory, and technological infrastructure to serve the growing enterprise cryptocurrency market. “We’re excited to bring on this team and its technology to accelerate our business,” said Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO.
 
With the purchase, Ripple gains Fortress Trust’s Nevada trust license, adding to Ripple’s existing licenses and approvals. Fortress was launched in 2021 by Scott Purcell, former CEO of the now-defunct crypto custodian Prime Trust.
 
Three years after Purcell’s departure, Prime Trust entered receivership when a proposed acquisition fell through. The company was then shut down by regulators and filed for bankruptcy after losing control of significant customer funds.
 
 
Known primarily for cross-border payments, Ripple has expanded into areas like liquidity and tokenization. The company says the purchase will improve experiences for existing products and allow exploration of new offerings. The deal is pending due diligence and approvals.

In that short span, the nation has undergone remarkable changes and improvements. While some might consider it a mere coincidence, the most plausible explanation lies in the profound transformations initiated by the country, with Bitcoin at the heart of its rebranding and a notable shift in attitude among its citizens. This article explores the impact of Bitcoin's legal tender status on El Salvador's development, the challenges it has faced, and the broader implications of this groundbreaking decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recently filed court document, blockchain-based publishing company LBRY has signaled its intent to challenge a New Hampshire district court’s verdict. This ruling, made in November 2022, concurred with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stating that LBRY presented its digital assets as securities or investment contracts.
 
Unregistered Crypto Securities Saga: LBRY Challenges SEC Amid Wider Crypto Scrutiny
 
The LBRY project has lodged its intention to contest U.S. district judge Paul Barbadoro’s ruling, which determined LBRY peddled unregistered securities. On November 7, 2022, the court greenlit the SEC’s summary judgment request, deeming LBRY, Inc. in breach of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.
 
After the verdict, LBRY faced a fine of $111,614 and was “permanently restrained” from any security offerings based in the United States. The blockchain project stood as the first crypto venture to square off with the SEC in such a case.
 
Subsequently, the U.S. securities watchdog has launched a plethora of enforcement actions, tagging numerous crypto assets as “unregistered securities.”
 
 
Currently, these alleged crypto securities boast a combined valuation surpassing $78 billion. Amid the extensive list spotlighted by the SEC, LBRY is the 36th largest by market capitalization.
 
Timothy McLaughlin from the law firm Shaheen & Gordon submitted LBRY’s intention to appeal. On the social media network X (previously known as Twitter), LBRY announced it had “filed a Notice of Appeal against the SEC.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cronos rose for a second consecutive session, as the token continued to move away from a recent three-month low. Volatility in the marketplace was high on Friday, after several days of price consolidation. Stellar also surged, moving to a three-day high.
 
Cronos (CRO)
 
Cronos (CRO) continued to move away from a recent three-month low on Friday, after rising for a second straight session.
 
After trading at a bottom of $0.05072 on Thursday, CRO/USD surged to a peak of $0.05291 earlier in the day.
 
This moves comes as cronos bulls managed to avoid a full breakout below a support point at $0.0495.
 
 
One reason for this was the stability of the support point of 34.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 49.60, with the next point of resistance around 52.00.
 
In the event that price strength climbs beyond this point, CRO will most likely be trading around $0.05500.
 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
Stellar (XLM) rose to a three-day high in today’s session, as bulls continued to target a key price ceiling.
 
XLM/USD hit a high of $0.1271 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at $0.122.
 
The move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average approaches an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
This is the closest that traders of stellar have come to taking price over a resistance zone of $0.1300 since Tuesday.
 
Today’s surge came as the 14-day RSI broke free of a ceiling at 49.00, moving to a current level of 51.08 in the process.
 
Despite this, earlier gains have marginally eased, with XLM now trading at $0.1253.
