Interest Rate Cuts Not The Silver Bullet For Higher BTC Price
 
Hayes stated on X that despite the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell virtually confirming the incoming interest rate cuts from September 2024 onwards, Bitcoin price might not behave the way many in the crypto market expect it to.
 
Since Powell’s Jackson Hole speech on August 23, 2024, Hayes notes that Bitcoin price has been on a steady downward trajectory, tumbling from approximately $64,000 to $58,881 by Sep 3, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, the governor of the Bank of Japan declared that should the economy and price show expected performance, the central bank would boost the key interest rates even further. Rising around 146 against the US dollar, the Japanese yen recovered from a two-week slump under a hawkish view on the BOJ’s monetary policy.
 
 
This hawkish move by the BOJ, and its governor Kazuo Ueda, has led to a strengthening of the Japanese yen (JPY) against other major currencies, including the greenback. The USD/JPY exchange rate has retreated to nearly 150, marking the yen’s strongest position since March.
 
The appreciation of the yen as a “anti-risk” currency has had knock-on effects on world markets, contributing to tighter financial conditions and higher risk aversion among investors.
