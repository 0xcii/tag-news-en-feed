        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e752473df71</id>
        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-outlook-for-april-btc-hits-31000-what-next/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-14T20:37:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the halfway point of April, bitcoin has risen beyond the $31,000 point for the first time in ten months. This rise in bullish sentiment comes as global inflation continues to fall, with many expecting central banks to soon pivot from current policies of monetary tightening. 
 
Current Market Status
 
April started mostly with consolidation, as traders continued to digest the last month’s banking crash, and Federal Reserve 25 basis point rate hike.
 
However, following the non-farm payrolls report, which dropped to 236,000 in March, down from 326,000 the month prior, bulls began to reenter the market.
 
Since then, inflation data has also been released, with consumer prices in China falling to an eighteen-month low, which pushed bitcoin back above $30,000.
 
In the United States, prices have also dipped, falling to 5% in March, with retail sales, also edging lower.
 

 
April Outlook
 
These factors have so far helped bitcoin, and led to prices moving above $31,000 for the first time since last June.
 
During last month’s outlook, BTC was trading at a low of $19,628.25 on March 10, and as of writing, BTC/USD has now moved to a high of $31,005.61 earlier today.
 
One of the catalysts for this move was a breakout, which took place on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 
 
Bulls moved past a ceiling at the 68.00 mark, moving deep into overbought territory, by hitting a peak at 72.44.
 
In January, the index rose to a high of 89.00, which means that despite being overbought, there could still be some further gains as the month progresses.
 
However, should the RSI fall below its aforementioned support at 68.00, bears could begin to reappear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trust will utilize three separate key holders to offer the benefits of multisignature custody to institutional investors.
Onramp Bitcoin has launched the first-ever spot bitcoin trust product that employs multi-party custody. This product is tailored to high-net-worth individuals, corporations and institutions seeking to gain exposure to bitcoin, according to a press release. 
The trust product will utilize three institutional-grade key holders, a qualified custodian named Kingdom Trust, and Bitcoin custody service firm Unchained Capital, to ensure that the custody of client bitcoin has no single point of failure. 
Onramp is the first trust to leverage a multi-signature setup, requiring a quorum to move funds. The product is designed for those who want exposure to bitcoin without the tradeoffs of full third-party custody, but who are not yet ready to take on the responsibility of full self-custody.
According to the press release, Onramp's solution is also intended to address the limitations of existing Bitcoin fund vehicles, including single-point-of-failure custody, taxable events on withdrawal and lack of Bitcoin focus and education. 
The trust will have a “Bitcoin-only focus with a commitment to education and advisory services to help clients excel during periods of volatility,” the press release describes.
The product will also offer segregated accounts with the ability to take possession of the underlying bitcoin without incurring a taxable event.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-04-14T15:43:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano rose to its highest level in seven-months on April 14, as cryptocurrency markets remained bullish. The global crypto market cap rose by as much as 2.25% on Friday, with bitcoin moving above $31,000. Xrp was another notable gainer, as the token hit a two-week high.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) rose for an eighth straight session on Friday, with today’s gains sending the token to a seven-month high.
 
ADA/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.4441 earlier in today’s session, after trading at a low of $0.4115 on Thursday.
 
Friday’s surge in price saw cardano climb to its strongest point since September 27, when prices hit a high of $0.4631.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s jump came following a breakout of a key resistance level of $0.4230.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) also moved beyond its own ceiling at 65.00, and is currently tracking at 71.06.
 
An upcoming ceiling at 72.00 now awaits ADA bulls, and should they fail to move past this point, earlier gains may fade.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was once again in the green, as the token continued to move away from a recent price floor.
 
Following a low of $0.5092 on Thursday, XRP/USD rose to a high of $0.5438 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s move in price, XRP moved to its highest level since March 29, when the token hit a then eleven-month high of $0.5848.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that one catalyst for the move was the 14-day RSI bouncing from a floor at 57.00.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 62.97, which is marginally below a point of resistance at the 63.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5274, which is slightly lower than its earlier peak.
