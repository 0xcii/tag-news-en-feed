        <updated>2023-11-02T10:41:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taiwanese law enforcement recently revealed the seizure of more than 320 million USDT stablecoins from an alleged money launderer. The seizure has been described as Taiwan’s largest bust ever from a single individual.
 
Lamborghini and a Lexus Seized
 
Taiwan’s law enforcement recently said it nabbed the four individuals behind what is being described as the region’s “largest virtual currency money laundering syndicate.” In a statement, the region’s law enforcement bodies said one of those arrested who is only identified as Qiu is said to have laundered more than 320 million USDT stablecoins. Three more individuals were also arrested alongside Qiu, the statement added.
 
According to a local language report, the now-seized funds relate to an investment fraud case operated by Qiu which was uncovered back in October 2022. However, despite the unmasking fraud scheme, law enforcement agents did not immediately arrest Qiu who is said to have frequently travelled to Malaysia and other South East Asian countries.
 
 
However, it was upon his return to Taiwan in June 2023 that agents finally detained Qiu and his accomplices and seized their mobile phones. As stated in the report, officials only discovered the extent of Qiu’s money laundering activities after they examined the accused’s mobile phones. As per the report, the value of the virtual currency during the raid on Qiu is believed to be the highest amount ever seized from one individual.
 
Besides the virtual currency, Taiwanese law enforcement is reported to have recovered two vehicles, a Lamborghini URUS and a Lexus LM luxury from Qiu’s residence. Laptops, credit cards, drugs, and three expensive watches were also seized.
 
Meanwhile, prosecutors from the Taichung District Prosecutor’s Office are said to have set Qiu’s bail at just over $3,000 and $600 for one of his accomplices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent statement via X (formerly known as Twitter), Jurrien Timmer, the Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, expounded on Bitcoin’s latest market movements and reiterated his view of the digital asset as “exponential gold.”
 
“Bitcoin is on the move again (following the pattern of previous boom-bust cycles, so far). What to make of it? Let’s revisit my thesis from late 2020,” Timmer shared, adding that, “In my view, Bitcoin is a commodity currency that aspires to be a store of value and a hedge against monetary debasement. I think of it as exponential gold.”
 
What This Means For Bitcoin
 
In his analysis, Timmer compared BTC to gold, noting gold’s limitations in modern economics. He explained that gold is money, but is “too deflationary and clunky” to be used as a medium of exchange…]]></summary>

Nigerians Told to Ignore the Message
 
The Nigerian Central Bank has refuted claims in a widely circulating text message that it plans to redenominate the faltering local currency in January 2024. In a statement released by its director of communications, the bank said the Nigerian public should ignore the “misleading” message whose objective is to cause chaos.
 
 
According to the bank, the said text message, which has been dismissed before, is now seemingly gaining traction and has sparked several debates on such a policy’s impact on the economy.
 
“We wish to reiterate that the contents of the message are misleading. The authors of the message, in their mischief, modified a text eked from an old policy by a previous CBN Governor in 2007 to make it appear recent,” the central bank’s statement said.
 
While acknowledging that it is considering reforms, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) however said it has not taken steps to redenominate the naira as stipulated in the CBN Act of 2007. Meanwhile, the bank has since urged Nigerians to ignore the “speculative” message which is “calculated to cause panic in the polity.”

While his fondness for digital currencies, notably Dogecoin, is widely known, his stance on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) appears to be less enthusiastic, as highlighted in a recent interview on the Joe Rogan podcast.
 
NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, represent unique digital assets that are verified using blockchain technology, providing proof of ownership and authenticity. However, Musk’s reservations seem to stem from the implementation and technical aspects surrounding NFTs. 
 
 
The Quirks Of NFTs: Elon Musk Makes Noise
 
In the podcast released on Oct. 31, Musk remarked, “The funny thing is the NFT is not even on the blockchain — it’s just a URL to the JPEG.”
