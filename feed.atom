        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current price action shows Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently in a triangular formation whose breakout might send it on a substantial surge upwards. However, while the crypto continues to trade within this triangular pattern, on-chain data shows a strong resistance wall, which could pose a strong threat to a SHIB price increase in the short term. 
 
 
According to data from IntoTheBlock, this interesting resistance wall sits around an average of the $0.000027 price level, which consists of 149,120 addresses that are holding 109 trillion SHIB tokens.
 
Major Hurdle For Shiba Inu
 
After a run to $0.0000287 in late May, Shiba Inu reversed to $0.0000237 in early June and has been stuck in a narrow trading range between $0.000023 and $0.000026. Interestingly, ITB data correlates this price level wi…]]></summary>
