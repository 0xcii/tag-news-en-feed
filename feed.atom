        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is experiencing increased volatility after a recent dip to $60,000, a critical level it currently holds above. Following the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut announcement, Bitcoin’s price surged aggressively but is now retesting key demand levels, likely determining its next target.
 
 
According to data from Glassnode, there has been a clear improvement in Short-Term Holder profitability throughout the recent rally. This has relieved investors who bought BTC during the price run-up, as many are now back in profit. Despite this positive data, uncertainty lingers in the market, with concerns of a deeper correction.
 
The short-term outlook remains uncertain as traders closely watch whether BTC can hold this crucial level or if further downside pressure will prevail.

The specific grounds of the SEC’s appeal remain undisclosed so far, leaving the XRP community in the dark. However, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has clarified via X that the secondary market status of XRP, e.g. its sale on crypto exchanges in the US, is not up for debate.
 
XRP Status On Secondary Market Is Safe
 
Morgan highlights the distinction between different types of sales, emphasizing the nature of those that were contested in court. “There is some confusion in this matter about the issue of secondary sales,” Morgan notes on X, explaining, “Some people treat Ripple’s sales by the programmatic means to retail investors via excha…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Has Plunged As Short-Term Holders Have Been Realizing Gains
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the short-term holders have started taking profits again recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Realized Profit/Loss Ratio,” which, as its name implies, tells us about how the profit and the loss volumes being moved by Bitcoin investors currently compare.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average holder on the network is moving their coins at a net profit. On the other hand, the indicator being under this threshold suggests loss-taking is the dominant form of selling in the market.

Amid this turbulence, many analysts focus on Bitcoin’s growing correlation with Gold as a key metric to watch. BTC, often called “digital gold,” has been showing an increasingly strong connection to the precious metal, especially in times of uncertainty.

Recently, a division of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a recent ruling by the lower court in favor of the telecom company and thereby allowed the case to continue in trial.
 
This ruling also brings back on track Terpin’s lawsuit against the telecom company, and consequently, underlines important issues involving the different roles of telcos in protecting customer information.
