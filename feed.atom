PeckShield, a blockchain security and analytics company, reports that 1,900 ETH (around $4.5 million) worth of the cross-chain lending protocol Radiant Capital was compromised.
 
The Web 3 security community and developers that make up the Radiant DAO committee acted quickly in response to the reports, halting the loan market on Arbitrum for a short period of time.

Hogan’s guidance centers on a prevalent practice among crypto holders: the short-term reallocation of funds from one digital asset to another, including moves from XRP to alternative digital currency. He highlights the potential tax implications of such strategies, emphasizing how they could unintentionally result in increased tax burdens.

According to Bons, deciding not to pursue sharding and instead relying on layer-2 platforms like Arbitrum, Base, and OP Mainnet will “gradually see Ethereum dig their own grave.” 
 
 
The founder added that removing the phrase “increase layer-1 gas limits” entirely sends a clear signal to the market that “Ethereum is not scaling at all.” This decision, the founder continued, is a “punch to the gut for early adopters” who supported Ethereum based on the promise of scalability.
