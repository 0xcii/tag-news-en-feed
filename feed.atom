The outcome of this case is crucial for XRP holders, as it will determine whether the asset is deemed inherently a security. If the issue of secondary market sales is not addressed, it could impact the relisting of XRP on exchanges like Coinbase.

The “Undeads Runner” game has gone into production and is being built in-house. The Undeads team has expanded to include a new production team dedicated to the game’s creation and will not affect the production of the current Undeads Metaverse game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prominent pro-XRP attorney John Deaton and Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, have disclosed that unsealing William Hinman’s emails is inevitable, even if the SEC settles with Ripple.
 
The revelation came during a discussion initiated by a known figure within the XRP community and a crypto detective Mr. Huber.
 
Deaton and Schwartz both echoed the opinion that the authority to keep the emails confidential does not lie with Ripple. This is because Judge Analisa Torres had previously ruled that the emails and drafts from the former director of SEC’s Corporation Finance, Hinman, are judicial documents.
 
They stated that the public’s right to access these documents outweighs any potential settlement between Ripple and the SEC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin rose for a sixth consecutive session to start the week, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. As of writing, the global market cap is up by as much as 2.50%. BNB was also in the green, hitting a 20-day high on Monday.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was a notable mover on Monday, as the token climbed for a sixth consecutive session.
 
LTC/USD raced to a peak of $92.16 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $89.10.
 
This move has led to litecoin climbing to a key resistance level of $93.00, which was last hit on May 23.
 
 
From the chart, the recent rise seems to be a result of the relative strength index (RSI) breaking out of a ceiling at 51.00.
 
The index has since rallied further, hitting a resistance point at 57.00, which has resulted in earlier gains fading.
 
At the time of writing, LTC is trading at $91.38, with price strength at a reading of 56.05.
 
 
BNB
 
BNB, or binance coin, was also in the green to start the week, with prices moving to a multi-week high in the process.
 
Following a bottom at $307.53 on Sunday, BNB/USD rose to an intraday peak of $316.83 earlier today.
 
This surge saw BNB hit its highest level since May 9, when the token was trading above $320.00.
 
 
Overall, BNB is now trading 2% higher than at the same point last week, with today’s rally sending the RSI to its strongest reading since May 1.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) is also moving towards an upwards crossover with the 25-day (blue) MA.
 
Should this cross take place, there is a good chance that BNB will move towards a long-term ceiling at the $340.00 mark.

Bitcoin Shrimp Supply Has Hit A New All-Time High Value
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the supply held by shrimps has gone up by 24,600 BTC in the past month alone. The “shrimps” here refer to Bitcoin holders that are currently carrying a wallet balance of less than 1 BTC.
 
As these investors are holding such low amounts, they are likely to be retail investors. This means that the “shrimp supply” (which is naturally the total amount of Bitcoin that the combined addresses of such holders are holding at the moment) can provide insight into the behavior of the retail investors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin climbed above the $28,000 level on Monday, as U.S. President Joe Biden confirmed that a deal was agreed in principle. Biden labeled the agreement a “compromise,” with Republican Kevin McCarthy calling it “historic.” Ethereum was also higher on the news, hitting a three-week peak.
 
Bitcoin
 

 
Bitcoin (BTC) rose above the $28,000 to start the week, as crypto markets reacted to an apparent agreement to increase the U.S. debt ceiling.
 

 
Following a low of $27,125.53 on Sunday, BTC/USD raced to a peak of $28,432.04 earlier in today’s session.
 

 
As a result of today’s rally, bitcoin moved to its highest point since May 8, when price reached a high of $28,676.
 

 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Overall, it appears that the latest move took place once the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 53.00.
 

 
Price strength has since climbed, and the index is currently tracking at 54.92, with the next point of resistance at 57.00.
 

 
Should this momentum continue to increase, there is a good chance that BTC will move above the $29,000 mark.
 

 

 
Ethereum
 

 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also moved higher on Monday, climbing above the $1,900 level.
 

 
ETH/USD jumped to an intraday high of $1,926.42 earlier in the day, following a low of $1,839.13 the day prior.
 

 
This surge led to the world’s second largest cryptocurrency hitting a three-week high in the process.
 

 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Looking at the chart, today’s surge came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 

 
If this trend continues, there is a strong chance that ethereum could move closer to $2,000 in the upcoming week.
