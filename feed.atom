October has historically been a strong month for cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. However, we have yet to witness the impressive gains we’ve seen in previous years. Currently, Bitcoin is up over 6% for the month, which is somewhat encouraging. Given how “Uptober” began, it seemed likely that the month would end either flat or with minimal returns. So, what caused this, and why haven’t we seen the significant gains expected? If we look back to the start of October, several announcements and developments during that time contributed to Bitcoin’s initial slump earlier in the month.
