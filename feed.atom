        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Online payment company PayPal is set to integrate its PayPal USD stablecoin (PYUSD) into the Solana (SOL) blockchain, which is increasingly becoming the preferred choice for memecoin issuers. 
 
This move follows the successful launch of PYUSD on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and its subsequent addition to PayPal’s Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payments service. According to Bloomberg, the decision to join Solana was driven by the blockchain’s speed and low transaction fees. 
 
Expanding PYUSD’s Reach In The Memecoin Market
 
Solana’s transaction processing capabilities, currently measuring 1,423 transactions per second (tps) according to SolanaFM, attracted PayPal to the blockchain. In comparison, Ethereum processes around 12 to 15 tps.

Ripple Follows Up With New Filing
 
In the detailed letter to Judge Torres, authored by Andrew J.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto market is buzzing with the recent approvals of Ethereum ETFs, stirring discussions and speculations among investors and analysts alike.
 
Since the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF last week, Ethereum has only recorded a surge to as high as $3,959 so far, before now retracting to a current trading price of $3,757.
 
Although reaching the $3,900 mark represents a significant increase, it falls short of the dramatic surge anticipated by many following the US SEC’s approval of the spot ETFs.
 
 
Is Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Priced In?
 
According to a recent report, experts are divided on whether the impact of these approvals has been fully priced in the market.

Bitcoin CDD Has Just Observed A Spike Larger Than November 2018
 
As pointed out by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the BTC CDD has just witnessed a huge spike. The CDD is an on-chain indicator that’s based on the concept of “coin days.”
 
A coin day is a quantity that 1 BTC accumulates after staying dormant on the blockchain for 1 day. Thus, when a coin remains on the same wallet for some number of days, it gains an equal number of coin days.
 
 
When such a dormant coin is finally moved on the network, its coin days counter naturally resets back to zero, and the coin days it had been carrying before are said to be “destroyed.” T…]]></summary>
