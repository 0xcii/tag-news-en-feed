As pointed out by an analyst, Ali, in a post on X, the DOGE network has seen some impressive growth in addresses recently. The relevant on-chain indicator here is “Daily New Addresses,” which keeps track of the total amount of addresses coming online for the first time on the Dogecoin blockchain every day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recently disappeared GBTC discount may be “a sign of industry maturing and the improved enterprise acceptance of bitcoin.” While some see the disappearance of the discount as pointing to the re-emergence of the premium to the net asset value (NAV), one expert said he sees “the continued parity or even a resurgence of the discount” as real possibilities.
 
The Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals
 
On or around January 26, the discount to the net asset value (NAV) of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) narrowed to zero for the first time in nearly three years. Since descending to 44% in June 2023, the discount has gradually shrunk and by Dec. 20, 2023, it had reached the single-digit figure of 7%.

This is not on any level what Anarchy means. It is simply a system lacking rulers or a central authority, where all cooperation and coordination is done on a purely voluntary basis between peers in the system. The etymology of the original Greek word, anarhkia, itself literally just means “without rulers.” An, meaning without, arkhia, meaning rulers. 
This concept is the foundational reality of why Bitcoin functions as a distributed network and protocol. There is literally no one in charge of the network. If there were, then it would not be a distributed system composed of sovereign individuals voluntarily choosing to interact with each other.

Google Changes Crypto Policies, Allows Bitcoin ETF Ads
Google, the software and advertisement company, has changed its advertising policies, allowing some cryptocurrency finance products to be featured in ads and sponsored links on its platform. The company announced this move in December when it announced this would focus on clarifying “the scope and requirements for the advertisement of cryptocurrency coin trusts.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an exciting turn of events, the cryptocurrency market is poised to extend its recent comeback, buoyed by a fresh $1 billion injection of capital from Tether, a leading stablecoin issuer. This move comes during a period of aggressive expansion for the stablecoin operator, having already added a staggering $13 billion in USDT to Ethereum and Tron platforms since October of the previous year.
 
 
Tether Market Cap On Solid Footing
 
Tether’s market capitalization now stands at an impressive $96 billion courtesy of the fresh billion-dollar minting, solidifying its position as the leading stablecoin. The company’s growth trajectory has been further bolstered by the recent collapse of major crypto entities such as Terraform Labs, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX.

crypto and NFTs, has partnered with Visa. This collaboration  
aims to empower users globally, enabling them to convert their

conversion process, bringing crypto-to-fiat capabilities to the fingertips of  
millions.
Targeting Swift Crypto-to-Fiat Conversions
Sami Start, the Co-founder and CEO of Transak,  
mentioned in a statement shared with Finance Magnates on Telegram: "We believe this partnership is an inflection point for Web3 as  
a whole. Now, millions across the globe have a straightforward way to cash out  
their digital asset holdings to their local currency intuitively and in real-time. They no longer have to walk the treacherous path of compliance

Notably, the figure alone was enough to overshadow the outflows recorded by Grayscale’s GBTC. This suggests that things are beginning to stabilize for the Bitcoin ETF market as net inflows overwhelm the outflows. 
 
Fidelity Records $208 Million Of Inflows
 
BitMEX Research revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Fidelity’s FBTC saw an inflow of $208 million on January 29. This figure more than offsets the $192 million in outflows recorded by Grayscale’s GBTC. Before now, GBTC’s outflows had been the major talking point and how they were negatively impacting BTC’s price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest data from Grayscale’s GBTC reveals that the trust’s bitcoin holdings have diminished to below 500,000, following a departure of 6,138.79 bitcoin from its reserves in the past day. Conversely, Blackrock’s IBIT has bolstered its bitcoin assets by 4,603.24 bitcoin, valued at $199 million.
 
GBTC’s Bitcoin Holdings Wane as Competing Funds Increase Their Caches
 

 
On Jan. 30, 2024, Grayscale’s GBTC’s bitcoin portfolio stood at 496,573.81 BTC, with an estimated market value of $21.43 billion. GBTC has experienced a significant depletion in its bitcoin reserve, with a decrease of approximately 120,506.18 BTC, equivalent to around $5.23 billion in value, since Jan. 12. On Jan. 29, the combined trade volume for all ten spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reached $1.59 billion, with GBTC contributing $576.01 million to this figure.
 

 
While GBTC experienced a decrease, Blackrock’s IBIT witnessed growth in the past day, escalating from 52,025.76 BTC to a current tally of 56,629.00 BTC, as per the latest IBIT figures. Fidelity’s most recent update for their holdings on Jan. 30 remains pending, and as of Jan. 29, FBTC’s holdings were at 46,238.09 BTC. However, onchain data indicates an increase to 47,238 BTC. ARKB, managed by Ark Invest and 21shares, now possesses 14,790 BTC. Bitwise’s BITB maintains a reserve of 13,576.10 BTC, having observed no growth in the last day.
 

 

 

 
The rest of the ETFs have yet to refresh their holding reports. Currently, Invesco has 6,833 BTC, Vaneck possesses 2,885.46 BTC, Valkyrie owns 2,635.29 BTC, and Franklin Templeton’s holdings are at 1,363 BTC. Holding the smallest bitcoin amount among the spot bitcoin ETFs is Wisdomtree, with 201 BTC valued at $8.7 million. All nine spot BTC ETFs hold 140,250.85 BTC as of Jan. 30, 2024.
