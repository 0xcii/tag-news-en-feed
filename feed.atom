        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phoenix, a Lightning wallet developed by Acinq, has undergone significant improvements with the introduction of splicing technology, resulting in a more efficient and user-friendly experience. Unlike previous versions, which created multiple channels and incurred unpredictable fees, the new Phoenix manages a single dynamic channel, eliminating the need for scattered liquidity and splitting issues.
With splicing, users can now resize channels, adding or removing funds without adding future risk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. VICTORIA, Seychelles, July 11, 2023 – Bitget, top crypto derivatives and copy trading platform, has launched an AI-powered feature for its Grid Trading strategies. The new feature aims to make this sophisticated investment method more accessible for new crypto traders without profound expertise in trading.
 
Grid trading is a quantitative strategy that utilizes trading algorithms to automate transactions for users. It involves trading algorithms that place buy and sell orders within a predefined price range at specified time intervals and follow a “buy low, sell high” strategy to execute trades. In volatile cryptocurrency markets, grid trading bots help eliminate emotional decision-making and efficiently execute a preplanned strategy, saving time and enhancing effectiveness.…]]></summary>

Magalhães shed light on its underlying architecture, providing insights into its design and functionality.
 
He has asserted that he successfully reverse-engineered the source code of Brazil’s pilot CBDC and uncovered certain functionalities within the code that could potentially enable a central authority to freeze funds or decrease balances at their will.
 
These functions encompass other functionalities including the ability to freeze and unfreeze accounts, modify balances by increasing or decreasing them, transfer currency from one address to another, as well as generate or eliminate digital real from a specified address.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unchained, a Bitcoin custodial services company, has announced the launch of its private client service with collaborative custody. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the new platform called “Unchained Signature” is a “membership-based service that helps high-net-worth individuals, institutions and corporations invest in and manage their bitcoin.”
The company compares the experience to that of premium banking services, but with the added twist of multi-signature custodial models that Unchained is known for. “The fact that clients hold their own bitcoin keys, even when they get a loan with their bitcoin used as collateral, is an assurance that Unchained is not able to singularly move or rehypothecate client funds, as many now-defunct crypto firms did prior to their collapse,” the press release stated.
Dedicated account management features described include private trade execution, multi-million dollar loans and retirement and estate planning — plus technical support, even to the extent that advisors will travel in-person for assistance during emergencies. In addition, Signature clients will receive early access to Unchained’s latest products as well as exclusive access to networking events. 
“As the best performing asset of the last decade, bitcoin continues to draw in new high-net-worth individuals and institutions, many of whom have previously shied away from crypto due to technical barriers and third-party risks,” said Joe Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Unchained, as he described the company’s opportunity. “Unchained Signature exists to help these investors buy, secure, and grow their bitcoin with as much technical and logistical assistance as they need — all without compromising security.”]]></summary>

According to the recent alerts from the VARA, the BitOasis crypto exchange is now under review. This comes after the authority had granted the conditionals license to BitOasis, allowing it to operate in the country. But it mandated the exchange to meet its requirements within 30-60 days.
