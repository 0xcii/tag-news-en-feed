Apart from the overall market strength, some factors have contributed to XRP’s current strength, ranging from easing legal troubles to Ripple getting a new money license in Asia. 
 
Ripple Updates Push XRP Price Surge
 
XRP price has witnessed sustained buying pressure this week as positive news swirls around the Ripple ecosystem to increase confidence from buyers. For one, Ripple’s legal issues seem to be easing as the payments technology company recently scored another win in court.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-matic-moves-to-highest-point-since-august/"/>
        <updated>2023-10-04T16:36:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon surged to its strongest level since the end of August, as the token extended recent gains. The rally comes despite cryptocurrencies mostly consolidating on Wednesday, following recent declines. XRP was another notable gainer today.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) rose for a back-to-back session on Wednesday, hitting a multi-week high in the process.
 
MATIC/USD moved to an intraday high of $0.5937 in today’s session, which comes following a low of $0.5523 the day before.
 
This resulted in polygon climbing to its highest point since August 29, when the price peaked at $0.6355.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge saw the relative strength index (RSI) rise past a ceiling at the 62.00 zone.
 
Currently, the index is now at a reading of 62.76, with an upcoming resistance level at the 70.00 point.
 
A crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages also seems to be one of the reasons for today’s rally.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP was another big mover on Wednesday, as the price attempted to break out of a key resistance level.
 
After Tuesday’s low at $0.5075, XRP/USD rallied to an intraday high of $0.5449 during today’s session.
 
As a result of this surge, the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency briefly rose past a ceiling at $0.5400.
 
 
Earlier gains have since edged lower, which comes as the RSI fell below a ceiling at the 62.00 mark.
 
The index has since dropped further, and is now tracking at 56.57, and seems to be heading towards a floor of 51.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A substantial amount of $4.1 billion worth of FTT tokens was 
moved between FTX and Alameda Research before the cryptocurrency exchange 
collapsed. As former FTX's CEO Sam Bankman-Fried faces a series of charges linked 
to the exchange's downfall, a recent report by Nansen has revealed questionable 
transactions involving FTX and its hedge fund, Alameda Research. 
It all began with the discovery that Alameda held a 
significant share of 40% of its assets, worth $14.6 billion in the form of FTT 
tokens, in September 2022. But Nansen's analysts had their suspicions even 
before these reports surfaced.   
Between September 28 and November 1, $4.1 billion worth of

If Recession, Then Not Inflation
Last week, I wrote about the Fed Funds Futures curve, concluding rate cuts will likely start in the middle of next year, giving bitcoin plenty of room to rally through the halving season. That analysis is based on the high probability that a recession is coming, which does not match with the common belief that inflation is heating back up. Today, I want to discuss a couple common paradoxes to clear up that disconnect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears financial services giant Block is closer to going public with its first Bitcoin hardware wallet product.
Teased yesterday by a beta tester, the images offer a first glimpse of Block's new Bitcoin hardware wallet, first announced in 2022, and reveal a small hexagon-shaped device complete with a fingerprint censor, which adds an extra layer of biometric security to the device.
The unveiling comes on the heels of several hints and teasers from Block, the financial services company co-founded by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. 
Block's entry into the hardware wallet market comes at a time when Bitcoin security and self-custody is of paramount importance, as evidenced by the ongoing trial of disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
Bankman-Fried's mismanagement of the exchange contributed to the loss of billions worth of customer crypto, funds that otherwise would have been unaffected had users had control of the private keys for these assets.
In previous reports, Dorsey has hinted at the company's vision for the hardware wallet, emphasizing the importance of allowing customers to maintain full control over their Bitcoin holdings. The device is expected to align with this philosophy, allowing users to securely manage their Bitcoin assets independently. 
To that end, Block's hardware wallet is anticipated to be competitively priced, ensuring that more individuals can participate in the crypto ecosystem without breaking the bank. Hardware wallets today typically retail for between $50 and $100, though prices vary depending on the make and model.



While the initial image of the hardware wallet offers a tantalizing glimpse of what's to come, the Bitcoin community eagerly awaits further details, including its release date, pricing, and additional features. 
Block's venture into the hardware wallet space is poised to make a significant impact, further solidifying the company's position as a key player.]]></summary>

In 2017, Bankman-Fried secured an investment of nearly $170

altruism. These investors were dedicated to finding ways to make a positive  
impact on society, often through donations or funding noble causes.
Bankman-Fried, a 26-year-old at the time, had ambitious

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin marginally rebounded on Wednesday, after the cryptocurrency collided with a key support point in yesterday’s session. Markets have consolidated Tuesday’s losses, with the global crypto market cap up 0.7% as of writing this. Ethereum remained under the $1,700 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) climbed marginally higher on Wednesday after the price bounced off a recent support point.
 
Following a low of $27,216.00 on Tuesday, BTC/USD surged to a peak of $27,632.90 earlier in the day.
 
The move pushed bitcoin further away from a recent floor of $27,200, and closer to a ceiling at $27,800.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that the rebound comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), bounced from a support level of its own at 58.00.
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is now tracking at 60.52, with the next visible point of resistance at 67.00.
 
Should this upcoming ceiling be broken, then there is a good chance that BTC will re-enter the $28,000 zone.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was largely lower in today’s session, despite moving away from a price floor of its own.
 
ETH/USD has fallen from an earlier peak of $1,662.45, and as of writing this is now trading at $1,648.07.
 
Although the cryptocurrency has moved away from its earlier peak, the price is trading above a floor of $1,620.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This comes as bulls rejected a breakout of the 50.00 level on the RSI indicator, with the index now tracking at 50.63.
 
In the event that momentum begins to pick up in the upcoming days, ethereum could be soon back over $1,700.

        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e74bd1d9fc9</id>
        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/bitcoin-cross-border-payments-substantial-bis-study"/>
        <updated>2023-10-04T13:23:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new study conducted by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has shed light on the true extent of Bitcoin's impact on cross-border payments, revealing that its significance may be even greater than previously believed. 
According to a report by Reuters, the findings challenge conventional assumptions and underscore the growing relevance of Bitcoin in the global financial landscape. 
Conducted by the organization's test lab, the study sought to comprehensively examine Bitcoin's role in cross-border transactions. While public data often provides a partial view of cryptocurrency activities, this study utilized a novel approach, including the development of a new "global Bitcoin mapping system" that also reportedly incorporates non-public data from private companies.
Details about the proprietary system were not provided by the report. Notably, however, it did acknowledge that its data is likely imperfect given it remains possible to use Bitcoin anonymously and without identification.
The system tracked transactions, addresses, and wallet movements to paint a more complete picture of Bitcoin's cross-border payment activities, the report said.
Moreover, the study revealed that Bitcoin was increasingly being used for remittances, providing a lifeline for individuals in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. Its borderless nature and ease of use made it an attractive option for sending funds across international boundaries. 
The findings of this study are expected to stimulate further discussions among regulators, financial institutions, and policymakers regarding the role of cryptocurrencies in cross-border transactions. 
Founded in the 1930s, the BIS is owned by member central banks, and its primary goal is to "foster international monetary and financial cooperation."
As such, the report demonstrates a continued interest in Bitcoin among global central banks, some who want a stronger regulatory approach to the technology.]]></summary>
