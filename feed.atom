        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VanEck has announced that if its proposal for a spot  
Bitcoin ETF is approved, the asset management firm will allocate 5% of the  
fund's profits to support Bitcoin developers.
VanEck's application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the  
United States is among several others awaiting validation from the US  
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The imminent approval of such a fund's listing is  
poised to attract unprecedented investment from traditional finance into cryptocurrencies.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Crypto Adoption 
Acknowledging the potential surge in investment,  
VanEck's pledge to donate a percentage of ETF profits mirrors its prior  
commitment to Ethereum developers, Coindesk reported.

— VanEck (@vaneck_us) January 5, 2024
Its dedication to contributing 10% of profits from  
an ether futures ETF to the Ethereum ecosystem last year highlighted the firm's  
involvement in supporting the fundamental layers of major cryptocurrencies.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.
