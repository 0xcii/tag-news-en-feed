        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mango Markets exploit, which was just one of the number of hacked and exploited dApps last year, was a remarkable one. The exploit led to roughly $114 million lost from the decentralized digital-asset exchange trading platform.
 
According to the latest update, it seems as though Justice is about to be served as the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against the attacker, which happens to be crypto trader Avraham Eisenberg. 
 
CFTC Sues Mango Market Attacker
 
Per a complaint issued by the regulator on Monday, Eisenberg carried out a “manipulative and deceptive scheme” in October, last year to pump up the price of swaps the decentralized digital-asset exchange Mango Markets, offered at the time by “culminating in the misappropriation of the funds.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) took a surprising development yesterday, Monday, January 9, when the world’s largest private BTC fund rose 12% in price. As TradingView data shows, the GBTC share price stood at $8.65 at the close of trading on Friday. However, during the course of Monday, GBTC saw unexpected buying pressure that pushed the price to $9.72.
 
In contrast, the Bitcoin spot price stagnated around the $17,200 level yesterday. This circumstance has contributed to the GBTC discount shrinking significantly. Already in the first days of the year, GBTC saw an upswing compared to the spot market. While the discount was 49% on December 30, yesterday the value dropped to 38%.

‘A Successful Payment Mechanism’
 
In its recently unveiled payments system document, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said the bank would be open to developing “a regulatory framework for [the] potential implementations of the stablecoin.” The document claims that such stablecoin implementations are likely “are likely to be a successful payment mechanism,” hence there is “a need to develop a regulatory framework for such implementation.”

According to CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies currently stands at $846.4 billion. Only a 1% decrease from yesterday’s $853.9 billion market cap. 
 
This surge in market valuation can be attributed to recent bullish price actions in the market. Based on data by CoinGecko, major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum are all experiencing a surge in price with BTC even breaking through its $17,000 resistance level. 
 
 
This rising trend in prices, however, is not continuous according to CryptoCapo. 
 
The prominent crypto expert who correctly predicted Bitcoin’s (BTC) downfall in 2022 believes the current market rise is likely a bull trap.
