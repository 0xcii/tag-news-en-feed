XRP, being one of the largest crypto assets by market cap, has been included in this increase. Although modest compared to its counterparts, XRP pushed to $0.6257 in the past 24 hours, representing a 5.88% price increase.  
 
According to popular XRP analysts, the recent move looks like the start of an extended bullish action for the cryptocurrency. Particularly, analyst EGRAG crypto has identified a three-camel hump pattern that could launch XRP to a target zone around $1 to $1.3.
