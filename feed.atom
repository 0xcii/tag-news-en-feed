Deaton, renowned for representing XRP holders in the Ripple-SEC lawsuit, marked the regulatory body’s conduct as an exhibit of overreach.
 
“The LBRY case should be taught in law schools across the country,” Deaton asserted on X (formerly Twitter), emphasizing its significance not just in applying “the Howey Test to modern-day blockchain technologies and crypto,” but also as a “specific highlight [of] SEC overreach.”

However, a legal action by the state of New York against Digital Currency Group, Genesis Global Capital, and the Gemini crypto exchange, alleging fraud exceeding $1 billion, created some uncertainty.
 
Bitcoin briefly dipped but eventually recovered, surging over 3% to approach the halfway mark to the key $30,000 level. Ethereum also saw a 2% increase but remained below $1,600, while most alternative cryptocurrencies were trading higher in the morning.
