        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data shows that Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has plunged into the red territory, which may explain why the asset’s price has crashed to under $68,000.
 
Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Turned Red
 
As explained by the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant in a post on X, the BTC Coinbase Premium Index dropped into negative territory just hours before BTC went through its correction.
 
The “Coinbase Premium Index” here refers to an indicator that tracks the percentage difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).

Dogecoin’s Role In Attracting Mainstream Demand For Crypto
 
Melker mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that mainstream FOMO (fear of missing out) will return to the crypto market when the foremost meme coin hits a new all-time high (ATH). His belief is based on the fact that “mainstream fervor” in the last bull cycle was driven by dog coins and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).

Bitcoin Has Registered A Drop Of 7% In The Last 24 Hours
 
Right after setting a fresh all-time high (ATH) not too far from the $74,000 level, the Bitcoin price has reversed its trajectory sharply during the past day.
 
 
The below chart shows how the digital asset has performed recently.
 

 
 
As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin quickly recovered back towards the $72,400 mark midway through the crash, but the retrace was only temporary, as the coin soon resumed its drawdown and dived under the $67,000 level.
