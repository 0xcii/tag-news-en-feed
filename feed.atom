        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) continue to be the dominant story of the market. The numbers of outflows continue to be enormous. Yesterday, on Tuesday, $515 million flew out of GBTC, for a total of $3.96 billion. Meanwhile, the “newborn 9” saw $407 million in flows. Thus, day 8 closed with a net outflow of $106 among all 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs.
 
The detailed breakdown from BitMEX Research (after day 8) reveals that Blackrock is still leading the charge with a positive inflow of $1,849.5 million, followed closely by Fidelity at $1,599.1 million, and Bitwise at $518.3 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are likely to divert investor interest and trading volume away from centralized exchanges (CEXs), according to Anthony Bevan, CEO of the wealth management firm Blockguard. Bevan, a full-time trader and investor, added that spot bitcoin ETFs are likely to attract investors who are keen on “more regulated and mainstream investment avenues.”
 
Decentralized ETFs
 
CEXs may have to enhance or upscale their service to match users’ high standards if they are to compete with spot bitcoin ETFs. Commenting on the wealth management system known as decentralized ETFs, the Blockguard CEO claimed that it excels at providing users or investors with “curated portfolios of thoroughly researched and back-tested coins.”

This surge, however, proved to be short-lived. Over the past 24 hours, BTC’s value has seen a significant downturn, trading below $39,000, marking a decline of nearly 5%.
 
The ripple effects of this decline extend beyond just market value. The global crypto market is also facing a surge in liquidations, with total liquidations reaching roughly $345 million, affecting over 130,000 traders, according to data from Coinglass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UBS, a financial services company, predicts that 2024 will be fruitful for gold, forecasting a price increase of 10% over current market prices. According to UBS analysts, this price increase will be powered by a pivot in the current policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is projected to start cutting interest rates as soon as May.
UBS Predicts Gold Price Rise, Rate Cuts
UBS, a Swiss financial services company present in over 50 countries, has predicted a bullish year for gold. In a note released on Friday, USB analysts predicted that gold prices could rise to 10% over current market prices despite the price reduction that the precious metal faced in December.
The institution expects that gold might be able to reach $2250 per ounce this year, given that there are still different factors that could push the demand for gold. One is the possibility of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut, that would awaken new interest in gold markets.
In this sense, UBS states that the “power of the Federal Reserve’s policy pivot should not be underestimated.” While there is still not a clear answer on the issue of when will the Federal Reserve start cutting interest rates, UBS expects a 100 basis points rate cut as soon as May. This would start “putting pressure on the U.S. dollar and real interest rates, which should spark fresh demand, particularly from exchange-traded gold funds.”
In December, the World Gold Council (WGC) anticipated a flat performance for gold in case of a “soft landing” scenario, which U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has already declared as reached.
UBS concluded that “ongoing macro and elevated geopolitical risks continue to justify holding exposure to gold for hedging and diversification purposes,” given that the asset is traditionally considered a crisis hedge due to its lack of credit risk and negative correlation to risk assets, according to WGC’s analyst Johan Palmberg.
