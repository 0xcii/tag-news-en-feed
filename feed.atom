        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to trade above the $27,000 level on Friday, after a surge beyond this point towards the end of yesterday’s session. Ethereum rallied to a one-week high.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin remained above the $27,000 level on Friday, following a late rise in bullish sentiment towards the end of Thursday’s session.
 
Following a low of $26,424.95 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $27,259.50 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, bitcoin rose to its highest level since September 20, when price peaked at $27,393.00.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
However, earlier gains have since edged lower, largely due to a collision which took place on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Looking at the chart, the index was unable to push past a resistance level of 58.00, and has since fallen to a reading of 56.57.
 
Traders could be awaiting the release of this afternoon’s consumer sentiment report in the United States, prior to deciding their next move.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) continued to trend higher on Friday, breaking out of a key resistance level in the process.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,687.28 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after trading at a low of $1,620.68.
 
This surge has resulted in ethereum climbing over a long held ceiling at $1,670, hitting a one-month high in the process.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
The latest uptrend coincided with the relative strength index moving beyond a ceiling of its own at 57.00. It is now tracking at 58.61.
 
Bulls will likely remain unsatisfied until they take ethereum back above $1,700, which hasn’t happened since the end of August.

In a recent development, the Commission has initiated a tender process aimed at adopting a model-based approach to mitigate the substantial environmental impact posed by the mining of cryptocurrencies.
 
This move underscores the European Union’s commitment to upholding its climate and sustainability objectives as outlined in the Paris Agreement.

Blockchain is a technology with the potential to turn the tide against ticket-scalping syndicates, Mohammed El Kandri, the founder of the blockchain startup Ir4lab, has said. Since transparency and traceability are some of the key attributes of blockchain, using this tech to tackle the ticket scalping scourge is a “no-brainer,” El Kandri added.

When the US

In preparation, the court has released the trial calendar, which shows how long the case is expected to last. 
 
A Close Look At The Calendar
 
According to the court document dated September 28, the trial is set to begin on October 4 and end on November 9. Although the first court session is set to occur on October 3, that day is solely set for Jury selection and not when the hearing will commence. 
 
Once that is done, Judge Kaplan, the judge in charge of SBF’s case, alongside the Jury, will begin hearing the Prosecution’s case against Sam Bankman-Fried on October 4. SBF’s lawyers are also expected to open their defense at some point.
