Russia Seeks Order In Crypto Frontier
 
The draft law, championed by Anton Gorelkin, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, proposes a licensing system for crypto miners. Only registered businesses and individual entrepreneurs would be allowed to mine, ensuring a level of accountability and oversight.

This decrease is notable, considering it came after the recent Bitcoin halving event on April 20, which traditionally boosted the cryptocurrency’s value but, this time, failed to counteract the bearish pressures from global economic uncertainties.
