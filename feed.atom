Founder Do Kwon's appeal, upholding his four-month prison sentence for falsifying  
documents. This decision intensifies Kwon's plight as he faces potential  
extradition following the completion of his sentence.
The decision by the court dealt a blow to Kwon's earlier attempt to overturn the prison sentence initially issued by a lower  
court in June. Alongside fellow Terraform Labs' executive Han Chang-Joon, Kwon was charged with falsifying documents.
This case emerged nearly a year after the collapse  
of Terraform Labs. Both individuals have remained in custody since their arrest  
in March. Once his term in the Balkan nation concludes, Kwon faces the

The report, aptly titled “Will the real stablecoin please stand up?”, categorizes stablecoins into four distinct types, including those backed by fiat currency, commodities, or other crypto assets, and assesses their stability. As the report notes, “while stablecoins backed by fiat currency, commodities, or other crypto assets have generally been less volatile than traditional crypto assets, not one of them has been able to maintain parity with its peg at all times”​
