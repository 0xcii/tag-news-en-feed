        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano ended a two-day losing streak on Monday, as the token moved closer to a two-month high to start the week. Cryptocurrency markets were mostly lower in today’s session, with the global market cap down 0.36% as of writing. Bitcoin cash also climbed, hitting a ten-day high.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) snapped a two-day losing streak to start the week, despite the global market cap mostly consolidating on Monday.
 
Following a low of $0.3729 on Sunday, ADA/USD surged to an intraday high of $0.4035 earlier in today’s session.
 
Today’s move saw cardano near Friday’s high of $0.4093, which was its highest point since mid-February.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the climb in price coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) moving towards a ceiling of its own at 60.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 58.91, after moving away from a floor at 56.00.
 
Should price strength move past the upcoming ceiling at 60.00, then there is a strong chance ADA will recapture a fresh multi-month high.
 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was another notable gainer to start the week, as the token moved to a ten-day high.
 
BCH/USD hit a peak of $129.15 on Monday, a day after the price was trading at a low of $120.54.
 
This rally sent BCH to its strongest point since March 24, when it rose to a peak at $132.05.
 
 
Earlier gains have since slipped, as the RSI collided with a ceiling at the 51.00 mark. Currently the index is tracking at 50.59, following a rally from a support point of 47.00.
 
Overall, bitcoin cash is now up 5.78% from the same point last week.

Banks are reportedly putting up a fortress of hurdles for these firms to jump over, with requests for additional documentation and transaction monitoring becoming the norm. 
 
With Natwest and HSBC slashing the amount of funds customers can move to digital currency exchanges and Barclays freezing Binance transfers, the future of crypto in the UK is looking bleaker than ever.
 
While these regulations were aimed at making the industry safer and more transparent, they also made it harder for firms to operate in the UK.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, there is a structural similarity forming between the current and 2018-2019 BTC cycles. The indicator of interest here is the “accumulation trend score,” which tells us whether Bitcoin investors have been accumulating or distributing over the past month.
 
This metric’s value represents not only the number of coins that the holders are selling or buying but also the wallet sizes of the entities that are taking part in the accumulation or distribution trends.

The Lightning Network is arguably the most impactful and important innovation ever seen in Bitcoin. It enables fast and cheap transactions that take up no space on the blockchain, while preserving all of Bitcoin's censorship-resistant and trustless features. While Lightning still has space to grow and improve, both in terms of technological stability and adoption, it has already proven to be an irreplaceable solution for cheap, trustless payments, with more than $100 million in network capacity and an ever-growing number of businesses adopting it as a payment method.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week consolidating above the $28,000 level, as markets prepare for a big week of U.S. economic data. The headline will be this Friday’s nonfarm payrolls, which are expected to fall to 238,000 jobs. Ethereum remains above $1,800 as of writing. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the week consolidating around the $28,000 level, as volatility in crypto markets remained high.
 
Following a low of $27,607.67 earlier in today’s session, BTC/USD rose to a peak at $28,475.62 as the day progressed.
 
The move saw bitcoin move closer to a recent resistance level at $28,500, which was broken over the weekend.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Recent price consolidation comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failed to move beyond a ceiling at 65.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 62.00, which is also a key point of support for traders.
 
Overall, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is now trading 1.46% higher than at the same time last week.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade above the $1,800 level, with traders still targeting a breakout above a key resistance level.
 
ETH/USD rose to a high of $1,819.29 earlier in today’s session, which comes after an earlier bottom at $1,765.52.
 
As a result of today’s jump, ethereum bulls attempted to move towards a ceiling at $1,825, however momentum has since eased.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This comes as earlier bulls seemingly abandoned their positions as the RSI ran into a wall at the 60.00 level.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now at the 57.77 mark, with the next visible ceiling around the 62.00 region.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average is now nearing a downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could signal upcoming price weakness.
