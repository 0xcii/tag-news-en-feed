        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin marginally rebounded on Wednesday, after the cryptocurrency collided with a key support point in yesterday’s session. Markets have consolidated Tuesday’s losses, with the global crypto market cap up 0.7% as of writing this. Ethereum remained under the $1,700 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) climbed marginally higher on Wednesday after the price bounced off a recent support point.
 
Following a low of $27,216.00 on Tuesday, BTC/USD surged to a peak of $27,632.90 earlier in the day.
 
The move pushed bitcoin further away from a recent floor of $27,200, and closer to a ceiling at $27,800.

From the chart, it appears that the rebound comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), bounced from a support level of its own at 58.00.
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is now tracking at 60.52, with the next visible point of resistance at 67.00.
 
Should this upcoming ceiling be broken, then there is a good chance that BTC will re-enter the $28,000 zone.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was largely lower in today’s session, despite moving away from a price floor of its own.
 
ETH/USD has fallen from an earlier peak of $1,662.45, and as of writing this is now trading at $1,648.07.
 
Although the cryptocurrency has moved away from its earlier peak, the price is trading above a floor of $1,620.

This comes as bulls rejected a breakout of the 50.00 level on the RSI indicator, with the index now tracking at 50.63.
 
In the event that momentum begins to pick up in the upcoming days, ethereum could be soon back over $1,700.

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/bitcoin-cross-border-payments-substantial-bis-study"/>
        <updated>2023-10-04T13:23:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new study conducted by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has shed light on the true extent of Bitcoin's impact on cross-border payments, revealing that its significance may be even greater than previously believed. 
According to a report by Reuters, the findings challenge conventional assumptions and underscore the growing relevance of Bitcoin in the global financial landscape. 
Conducted by the organization's test lab, the study sought to comprehensively examine Bitcoin's role in cross-border transactions. While public data often provides a partial view of cryptocurrency activities, this study utilized a novel approach, including the development of a new "global Bitcoin mapping system" that also reportedly incorporates non-public data from private companies.
Details about the proprietary system were not provided by the report. Notably, however, it did acknowledge that its data is likely imperfect given it remains possible to use Bitcoin anonymously and without identification.
The system tracked transactions, addresses, and wallet movements to paint a more complete picture of Bitcoin's cross-border payment activities, the report said.
Moreover, the study revealed that Bitcoin was increasingly being used for remittances, providing a lifeline for individuals in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. Its borderless nature and ease of use made it an attractive option for sending funds across international boundaries. 
The findings of this study are expected to stimulate further discussions among regulators, financial institutions, and policymakers regarding the role of cryptocurrencies in cross-border transactions. 
Founded in the 1930s, the BIS is owned by member central banks, and its primary goal is to "foster international monetary and financial cooperation."
As such, the report demonstrates a continued interest in Bitcoin among global central banks, some who want a stronger regulatory approach to the technology.]]></summary>

Bybit’s ‘Juristic Representative’
 
Bybit, the United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced on Oct. 2 that it had officially launched its crypto derivative products and a new fiat on-ramp service in South Africa. The crypto exchange said it will offer these services via its Money Doc (Proprietary) Limited, which acts as Bybit’s “juristic representative.”
 
In a statement, the crypto exchange revealed that Money Doc is an authorized financial services provider and a registered South African company. As reported by Bitcoin.com News almost a year ago, crypto asset service providers operating in South Africa must have a financial product service provider license from regulators.
 

 
Bybit meanwhile said its on-ramp service will enable users to deposit the rand currency (ZAR) via bank transfers. Commenting on the crypto exchange’s entry into the South African market, Joshua Yau, the regional manager for Africa, said:
 
“This marks a significant milestone for Bybit as we bring access to global leading products to the passionate crypto community in South Africa in line with regulatory requirements. This marks an important step in our compliance efforts. We are committed to providing a secure and seamless trading experience, industry-leading trading tools, and low-cost access that empower our users.”
 
Ben Zhou, the founder and CEO of Bybit, characterized the incursion into South Africa as the latest testimony of the crypto exchange’s commitment to its goal of making crypto trading accessible to all.

In 2022, a
