        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recent buzz surrounding the potential approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF has not only propelled Ethereum’s price but also sparked significant interest in Solana as a strong follow-up candidate for ETF consideration. Amid this optimism, Daniel Yan, co-founder of Matrixport, has proposed a strategic pivot for investors, suggesting a focus on Solana (SOL) in relation to Ethereum.
 
Is Solana The Next In Line?
 
In a post on X, Yan dissected the immediate market reactions to major ETF approvals and provided a strategic analysis for potential future moves. His insights draw from the historical market behavior observed following the spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF approval.
 
After the spot Bitcoin ETF’s acceptance on January 10, BTC experienced a significant drawdown of -15% in the weeks following the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One selling point for Bitcoin is that it is politically neutral. After all, it's a ledger, decentralized, and wherever we each fall on the political spectrum, we all need to keep track of our own funds. That’s not to say everyone thinks Bitcoin is the best way to do this, but the neutrality of the technology itself looked like an area on which it was easy to find agreement.
 But recently, that sense of being removed from political partisanship has been called into question in the United States, where increasingly, attitudes towards cryptocurrencies appear to be dividing along party lines as we head towards the presidential election.
