        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, warned on Friday that inflation remains too high and signaled the central bank may continue raising interest rates to get it under control. In remarks at the Jackson Hole symposium, Powell acknowledged recent progress in lowering inflation but said there’s “substantial further ground to cover” before returning to the Fed’s 2% target.
 
Powell Signals Further Rate Hikes Amid Lingering Inflation Concerns; Pledges ‘We Will Keep at It Until the Job Is Done’
 
While headline inflation has fallen from its peak of 7% in June 2022, Powell focused his remarks on core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Core inflation remains elevated at 4.3% and Powell said “sustained progress is needed” through “restrictive monetary po…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-25T18:36:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the newest episode of Bitcoin Magazine’s "Bitcoin, Explained,” hosts Aaron van Wirdum and Sjors Provoost discuss the ramifications of a newly discovered exploit dubbed “Milk Sad,” affecting Bitcoin users attempting to run the alternative Bitcoin implementation Libbitcoin when connecting to the network.
Revealed earlier this month, the issue of an insecure Bitcoin command called "BX Seed" in the Libitcoin library has made it vulnerable to attacks, potentially allowing adversaries to guess private keys and access Bitcoin funds.

As profiled, the insecure command produces only 32-bit random seeds, significantly reducing the number of possible seeds and making it relatively easy to guess a target user’s private keys.
The podcast delves into the history of the implementation, as well as other alternatives to the most widely used Bitcoin software, Bitcoin Core. The episode also touches on the responsibility of Bitcoin developers to ensure the security of their code, especially if that code is referenced in widely read resources like books or online tutorials. In this particular case, the BX seed exploit was referenced in Andreas Antonopoulous’ widely read “Mastering Bitcoin.” 
The hosts suggest that clear warnings should be provided in documentation to indicate that certain commands are unsafe for production use.
Ultimately, the podcast underscores the importance of secure coding practices, thorough testing, and proper communication to prevent vulnerabilities that could potentially lead to financial losses and security breaches in the cryptocurrency space.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-25T16:40:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the wake of the meme token’s meteoric ascent, pepe (PEPE) has plummeted by over 17% in the last 24 hours. Buzz on social media suggests a significant amount of funds held by the development team are being transferred to exchanges. Moreover, alterations have been made to the team’s multi-signature wallet.
 
Meme Token PEPE Tumbles: Wallet Alterations and Big Moves Ignite Suspicions
 
Doubts loom over the pepe (PEPE) meme token project amid chatter about hefty sums of PEPE shifting to centralized exchanges. On Thursday, onchain experts from Lookonchain pointed out, “[Four] hours ago, [the] Pepe multisig wallet and Wintermute Trading deposited 17.3T PEPE ($18M) to exchanges. [Three] hours ago, an early buyer of PEPE dumped 1.88T PEPE for 1,010 ETH ($1.68M) on a [decentralized exchange].”
 
 
Fast forward to August 25, 2023, Lookonchain delved deeper, revealing that a crypto whale splurged 320 ether on a whopping 640 billion PEPE just three hours prior to the post. Intriguingly, this same whale also amassed billions of PEPE back in June and May. Amidst this frenzied trading activity and intense speculation, it’s been unearthed that modifications have been made to the PEPE team’s multi-sig threshold.
 

 
One inquisitive observer asked:
 

Any reason why the PEPE multi-sig wallet changed the threshold to just 2/8 signatures? Seems weird, this isn’t standard right? Also, [it] seems that some has been sent to exchanges.
 
Chiming in, onchain expert Zachxbt detailed that PEPE tokens worth $6.5 million found their way to Binance, $8.2 million to Okx, $434K to Bybit, and an additional $389K to an unidentified destination. Since then, PEPE’s value has dwindled by over 17% in a day and 20% over the week. Within the last 24 hours, this meme coin boasted a staggering $294 million in global trade, clinching the 11th spot on Friday in trade volume rankings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin moved closer to a key support level on Friday, as the meme coin slipped for a second straight session. Today’s decline comes as the global crypto market cap edged lower, falling 0.77% lower as of writing. Toncoin was on the other side of the spectrum, hitting a one-week high.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin closed in on a collision with a key price floor on Friday, as the meme coin fell for a second straight day.
 
DOGE/USD dropped to a low of $0.0619 earlier in today’s session, following a high of $0.06308 the day prior.
 
As a result, dogecoin was a stone’s throw away from a support point at the $0.06000 mark.
 
 
This turn in sentiment comes after the price was unable to break out of a resistance level of $0.06500 on Wednesday.
 
The relative strength index (RSI) also failed to breach a ceiling of its own at 36.00, and is now tracking at 33.37.
 
Should this decline continue, bears will likely look to exit once the index reaches a floor around 32.00.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
On the other hand, toncoin (TON) was mostly in the green during today’s session, as price remained near a one-week high.
 
Following a low of $1.40 on Thursday, TON/USD peaked at $1.44 earlier in the day, its highest point since last Thursday.
 
The move saw the token near a resistance level of $1.50, a point which was last hit on August 16.
 
 
Sentiment has somewhat shifted as the day progressed, as a result of the RSI hitting a ceiling of 58.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 54.44, and seems to be heading towards a floor around the 50.00 region.
 
In the event this target is reached, TON will likely move below $1.20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have jointly announced a set of proposed regulations focusing on the sale and exchange of digital assets by brokers. The is part of the broader strategy set forth by the Biden-Harris Administration's bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), in attempt "to close the tax gap, address the tax evasion risks posed by digital assets, and help ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules."
"These proposed regulations would require brokers, including digital asset trading platforms, digital asset payment processors, and certain digital asset hosted wallets, to file information returns, and furnish payee statements, on dispositions of digital assets effected for customers in certain sale or exchange transactions," said the IRS.
These regulations obligate brokers of digital assets to report the specific sales and exchanges of their customers. The regulations also introduce the requirement for brokers to furnish a new Form 1099-DA, to help users determine if they owe taxes.
The implementation timeline specified in the regulations states that brokers would start reporting information on sales and exchanges of digital assets beginning in 2026, for transactions that occurred during the year 2025. The Joint Committee on Taxation's estimation is that these IIJA provisions could generate nearly $28 billion in revenue over 10 years.
The Treasury Department and the IRS are actively soliciting feedback from affected taxpayers, industries, and other stakeholders on the proposed regulations. Written comments will be accepted until October 30, 2023, and the agencies have scheduled a public hearing on November 7, 2023, with a potential follow-up session on November 8, 2023, if the demand necessitates it.]]></summary>
