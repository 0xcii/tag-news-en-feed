        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On this day 14 years ago, the Bitcoin price was born. 
As noted in a post on X today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo, October 5 marks the anniversary of the date on which NewLibertyStandard, a pseudonymous early Bitcoin user made public the first U.S. dollar price valuation for Bitcoin.
A home miner at the time, NewLibertyStandard notably used the price of electricity to calculate the exchange rate, factoring how much it cost for him to power his personal computer as he mined coins with little competition.
At the time, he reached the conclusion that 1,309 Bitcoin were worth $1, meaning that a single U.S. dollar could buy the Bitcoin produced by 26 blocks.
The calculation marked the first time that anyone had priced Bitcoin above zero. As noted by Rizzo, Satoshi Nakamoto never priced Bitcoin, nor, as far as we know, offered to buy or sell Bitcoin for dollars.
 
         
         
         
         
    
The date is notable as since then, Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency, has achieved a staggering milestone, with its price soaring by over 3.6 billion percent. 
Fast forward to the present day, and Bitcoin has become a household name, a symbol of financial innovation, and a store of value. It has weathered countless ups and downs, regulatory challenges, and market cycles, emerging as a resilient and highly sought-after asset.
The exponential growth of Bitcoin's price is a testament to its unique features and value propositions. Here are some key factors that have contributed to Bitcoin's remarkable ascent, including its adoption by the market. 
So, while NewLibertyStandard remained only a personal buyer and seller of Bitcoin, he remains one of its founding fathers, helping to create the conditions for later markets to flourish within a global Bitcoin economy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to consolidate on Thursday, ahead of the upcoming U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report in the United States. Payrolls are expected to come in at 170,000 for September, down from 187,000 the month prior. Ethereum fell for a fourth straight day. 
 
Bitcoin
 

 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade close to a key price ceiling on Thursday, ahead of tomorrow’s NFP report.
 

 
BTC/USD peaked at $27,875.59 earlier in the day, which comes following a low of $27,339.27 the day before.
 

 
The move pushed bitcoin closer to a recent resistance level of $27,900, however bulls were unable to capture this point.
 

 

 

 
Earlier gains have since faded, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) encountered some turbulence of its own.
 

 
At the time of writing, the index is at a reading of 60.21, which is marginally below a ceiling at 63.00
 

 
Should this decline continue, price strength could land at a floor of 58.00 in the not-too-distant future.
 

 

 
Ethereum
 

 
Ethereum (ETH) moved lower for a fourth straight session on Thursday, as the cryptocurrency closed in on a recent point of support.
 

 
Following a high of $1,654.43 on Wednesday, ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,632.72 earlier today.
 

 
This extended slippage pushed ethereum towards a floor at $1,620, which was last hit on September 29.
 

 

 

 
Today’s fall in price came as the RSI marginally dropped below a support of its own at the 50.00 zone.
 

 
Currently, the indicator is reading 49.24, with a lower level at 44.00 a possible target for sellers in the market.

In a new interview with YouTuber Tom Bilyeu, Hayes shared his bullish outlook on Bitcoin's price, projecting a staggering $750,000 to $1 million valuation for the leading cryptocurrency by 2026. 
During the interview, Hayes discussed several factors contributing to his optimistic Bitcoin price forecast, including Bitcoin's limited supply, the prospect of Bitcoin spot ETFs in major regulated markets, and geo-political uncertainty. 
Hayes further emphasized the fundamental aspect of Bitcoin's fixed supply, capped at 21 million coins. This scarcity, he believes, will drive increased demand as more investors seek to acquire a piece of the limited supply.
