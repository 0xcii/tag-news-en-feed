        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon climbed higher for a third straight session on Monday, as the token continued to move away from a recent support point. After a mostly bearish weekend, crypto markets eased back into the green to start the week. Shiba inu was a notable exception, as it extended a recent downtrend. 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) continued to move away from a recent support point of $0.5380 on Monday, as bulls’ momentum made a partial return to the market.
 
After trading at a low of $0.5479 on Sunday, MATIC/USD surged to an intraday peak of $0.5624 earlier today.
 
The rally saw polygon climb for a third straight day, pushing price closer to a one-week high in the process.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the surge took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 31.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is now tracking at 33.61, which is its highest point since August 16.
 
Should momentum continue to surge, the next target for bulls will likely be around the 43.00 mark.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) dropped lower for a fifth straight session to start the week, hitting a six-day low in the process.
 
SHIB/USD fell to a bottom of $0.000007911 earlier in the day, following a high of $0.000008118 the day prior.
 
However, as the day progressed, the cryptocurrency has rallied, and as of writing is currently trading at $0.000008156.
 
 
This comes as the RSI bounced from a floor of 40.00, and is now tracking at 43.93, marginally below a ceiling of 45.00.
 
In the event that this upcoming resistance point is broken, it is likely SHIB will move past $0.00000850.

Ethereum Daily Total Transaction Fee Has Declined Recently
 
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the transfer fees on the ETH blockchain have dropped to just 1,720 tokens recently. The indicator of interest here is the “total fees,” which measure the daily total amount of transaction fees that the users on the network are attaching with their transfers.
 
Generally, this metric observes a boost whenever the chain observes high activity. This is because the network only has a limited capacity to handle transactions, so higher than usual traffic means more competition among the users to process their transfers.

As bitcoin (BTC) dances around the $26K mark, several once-dormant bitcoin wallets are springing to life after years of inactivity.

The consumer confidence report will be released on Tuesday, with gross domestic product and nonfarm payrolls coming in the upcoming days. Ethereum was largely unchanged today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin started the week hovering around the $26,000 region, as markets prepared for a big week of economic data.
 
Following a high of $26,406.15 on Sunday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,914.93 earlier in today’s session.
 
The world’s largest cryptocurrency has mostly consolidated around this level for the past ten days, since surging above $30,000 earlier in the month.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Since then a huge red wave has swept through the market, with BTC falling to a two-month low just over a week ago.
 
Prices have continued to trend sideways as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has failed to break out of a resistance level of 30.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 27.34.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also consolidated on Monday, with prices largely unchanged from Sunday’s low.
 
ETH/USD climbed to a high of $1,665.14 earlier in the day, which followed on from Sunday’s bottom of $1,641.63.
 
The move saw ethereum once again climb above a support point of $1,650, following a recent drop below this zone.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Similar to bitcoin, the RSI has been unable to move past a ceiling of 33.00, which seems to be the main barrier to a bullish resurgence.
 
In the event this level is breached in the coming days, ethereum will most likely move above $1,700.
