        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[December 19, 2023 – 
NitroBetting.eu, a prominent Bitcoin-exclusive sportsbook, just released the first-of-their-kind Bitcoin Spot ETF betting lines. The new prediction market is focused on the SEC’s potential Spot ETF approval date, as well as speculation on which ETF sponsor will be the first to receive approval. According to the published odds, the market thinks it more likely than not that the SEC approves a Spot BTC ETF by 1/10/2024, with odds sitting at -1667 for, and +650 against.
With regard to ETF sponsors, at the time of writing, simultaneous approval for multiple applicants is the most favored scenario (-250), with Blackrock leading the pack as most favored for standalone approval (+120). Of all the potential Spot ETF sponsors, Wisdomtree (+2900) and Invesco (+2900) are the leas…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana is in the lead again, as the majority of crypto assets investment products witnessed net outflows of investments last week, bringing an end to 11 consecutive weeks of inflows. This wasn’t surprising though, as most cryptocurrencies went through a brief period of consolidation and profit-taking last week. 
 
According to the latest report from CoinShares, digital asset investment products saw minor outflows of $16 million last week, with the majority of the outflows coming from Bitcoin. However, despite the outflows, Solana picked up steam, with its net inflow jumping 240% percent from the previous week.

decision allowing for the extradition of Do Kwon, the Former CEO of Terra, to  
either the United States or South Korea. Instead, Kwon has been granted an  
appeal against this matter based on a procedural error. 
According to a report by Coindesk, citing documents  
shared by the court on Tuesday, the judge overseeing the case  
failed to grant Kwon the opportunity to present his stance regarding the  
extradition request from the United States. This is a mandatory step provided  
in the law.  
This oversight led to the successful appeal by  
Kwon's defense, redirecting the case to the Podgorica Basic Court for a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bank of Korea governor Rhee Chang-yong recently stated that the growing stablecoin use threatens the operations of central banks. The possible involvement of global networks like Visa and Mastercard in the stablecoin business will likely undermine the monetary independence of countries like South Korea. 
 
Central Banks Urged to Prepare for Digitization
 
The growing use of stablecoins like USDT and USDC is posing a new threat to the operations of central banks and may be making monetary policies less effective, according to Rhee Chang-yong, the governor of the Bank of Korea. Speaking at a recent digital money conference, Chang-yong urged central banks to prepare for digitization if they wish to keep abreast with the fast-changing financial landscape.
 
A Yonhap report states that the BOK governor believes global networks such as Visa and Mastercard’s likely involvement with stablecoins will undermine countries like South Korea’s monetary independence. Therefore, to stop stablecoins from wreaking havoc on his country’s capital inflows, Chang-yong proposed launching central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).
 
“This underscores the urgency for central banks to consider introducing central bank digital currencies (CBDC), whether retail or wholesale,” the BOK governor reportedly said.
 
 
While he conceded that retail CBDCs may have no clear advantage over regular payment methods, Chang-yong insisted that their programmability feature allows such digital currencies to bring with them “a realm of possibilities.” One such possibility is the execution of complex and conditional transactions automatically via smart contracts.
 
Meanwhile, the BOK also revealed that South Korea, which has already launched a pilot project for a retail CBDC system, is working on a wholesale pilot project. The South Korean Central Bank’s partners for the project include the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and financial regulators.

In a compelling parallel drawn between the economic trajectories of Japan starting in the 1980s and China’s current economic landscape, experts are now closely examining the similarities and lessons that can be learned.
 
Japan, in the 1980s, experienced a period of significant economic growth, marked by strong wage growth and rising prices. However, this was followed by a prolonged period of economic stagnation and deflation, from which, according to some, Japan is only now beginning to emerge. The cri…]]></summary>

The main cause of this sharp change of demand, which occurred after critics labeled the phone a “failure,” is the meteoric rise of the Solana-based meme coin BONK, which has seen an increase in value of over 10,000% over the last two months.
 
 
Solana Saga Phones Soar With BONK Airdrop
 
Sales of Solana Saga phones increased last week as a result of certain arbitrage traders seemingly pursuing an airdrop of 30 million BONK tokens, which is distributed to all phone owners. In peak value last week, the airdrop was more than $700 for a $599 phone.
