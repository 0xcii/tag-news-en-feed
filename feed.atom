Bloomberg Billionaires Index has revised its revenue estimate for the  
cryptocurrency exchange Binance, reducing it by 38% as data showed a decline in

This  
revision has had a significant impact on the wealth of Binance's founder,  
Changpeng Zhao, widely known as CZ, whose fortune has been reduced by $11.9  
billion, leaving him with a net worth of $17.2 billion.
Binance's Market Share: From  
Gain to Decline in 2023
The  
decline in Binance's fortunes came as trading volumes at the exchange dipped.  
CZ's involvement in recent events further complicated matters. In November, he  
announced the liquidation of a token associated with FTX. 
The  
announcement came after reports emerged that Alameda Research, a hedge fund led

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Proof-of-Stake (PoS) assets have recently faced a notable shift. According to a report, the market capitalization of PoS assets took some kind of beating, dropping by 7% in the third quarter of the year, with the total value shrinking to $254 billion. This decline has raised questions about the performance and future prospects of PoS assets.
 
PoS assets are a type of cryptocurrency that operates on a different principle than Proof-of-Work (PoW) assets like Bitcoin. In PoS, the validation of transactions and creation of new blocks are not dependent on energy-intensive mining processes. Instead, validators, or “stakers,” are chosen to create new blocks and verify transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to “stake” as collateral.
