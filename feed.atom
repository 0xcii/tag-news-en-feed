The Risks Of Memecoins
 
@Mishaboar expressed deep concerns regarding the current trend in the crypto markets where meme coins quickly achieve market capitalizations in the millions or even billions of dollars, facilitated by almost instantaneous listings on major exchanges.

        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/us-prosecutors-recommend-3-year-prison-sentence-for-binances-changpeng-zhao-report/"/>
        <updated>2024-04-24T13:06:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US prosecutors have proposed a 36-month prison sentence for Binance's former CEO, Changpeng Zhao. According to a report by  
CNBC, the prosecutors argued that such a sentence, which is double the advisory  
guidelines, reflects the seriousness of the charges against Zhao.
The recommendation, outlined in a sentencing  
memorandum filed with the Western District Court of Washington, highlights the  
severity of the accusations against Zhao, who stepped down from his position  
last November following a plea deal with the US Department of Justice.
US Prosecutors' Charges Against Zhao
US prosecutors said a 36-month custodial sentence  
is necessary to underscore the seriousness of the charges against Zhao, which  
include failure to implement anti-money laundering measures as mandated  
by the Bank Secrecy Act. The memorandum emphasized Zhao's alleged role in  
allowing Binance to process transactions involving proceeds of unlawful  
activity, including transactions from sanctioned countries.  
The case against Zhao comes amidst a backdrop of legal  
challenges for Binance, with the exchange facing lawsuits from both the US  
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading  
Commission (CFTC). 
Allegations include mishandling customer assets and  
operating an illegal, unregistered exchange in the US. Authorities have also  
ordered Binance to pay hefty fines, with Zhao agreeing to a $50 million penalty  
as part of the plea deal.
Despite Zhao's alleged confidence in evading  
consequences, prosecutors stress that his apprehension marks a turning point. Zhao, who stepped down from his role as CEO last year, has not  
publicly commented on the recent developments. His official sentencing is  
scheduled for April 30.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission recently approved Bitcoin Spot ETFs for several major asset managers, paving the way for the city to become a leading hub for such products. 
The approval comes after months of anticipation and marks a significant milestone for the Bitcoin industry in Asia.

JUST IN: 🇭🇰 Hong Kong spot #Bitcoin ETFs will begin trading on April 30: HashKey Capital
Asia is ready 🚀 pic.twitter.com/TDfNZTqPQU
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 24, 2024
 
 
 
HashKey Capital, a local asset management firm, confirmed that its Bitcoin ETF will start trading next Tuesday. In a statement, a spokesman for the firm acknowledged the launch date, making it one of the first companies to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong.
OSL, a digital asset platform that acts as a sub-custodian and infrastructure service provider for two major fund managers, has also indicated that spot bitcoin products aim to launch as early as late April. This news further solidifies Hong Kong's position as a frontrunner in the race to offer investors access to Bitcoin through traditional financial instruments.
Elsewhere, some of China's top asset managers are in the final leg of preparations for the spot Bitcoin ETFs to begin trading potentially by the end of April. 
This development is expected to attract significant interest from investors within and outside Hong Kong.

According to predictions by Singapore-based crypto services provider Matrixport and Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, Hong Kong Spot Bitcoin ETFs could bring in and unlock up to $25 billion in new demand. 
This influx of capital could have a profound impact on Bitcoin and further legitimize it as an asset class.]]></summary>

Zhao’s explicit disregard for US regulations was underscored by the DOJ in a scathing sentencing memorandum. They quoted Zhao’s own words, highlighting his approach to legal compliance: “Better to ask for forgiveness than permission,” suggesting a strategic bypass of regulatory requirements to expedite Binance’s market expansion and profitability.
