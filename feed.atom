enterprise, in May 2022.
Ongoing appeals
The extradition underscores the severity of the  
charges, as Chang-joon faces criminal proceedings in South Korea for various financial  
offenses. Meanwhile, Do Kwon's appeal regarding his extradition fate remains in  
the hands of Montenegro's appeals court, adding complexity to the legal matter.

Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Has Registered A Surge Of More Than 7%
 
On the Bitcoin blockchain, there is an in-built special feature called the “mining difficulty.” Basically, why this feature exists is to ensure that the block rewards on the network continue to be given out near a constant rate.
