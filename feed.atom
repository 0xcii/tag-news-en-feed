        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most Americans would like to see their monetary system change, according to a study conducted on behalf of Coinbase.
A study conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of Coinbase examined the perceptions of the global financial system and how U.S. adults and cryptocurrency investors view the future of the cryptocurrency market. It found that Americans believe the current financial system needs to be updated, and there is optimism about owning bitcoin as we head into the future.
The survey found that “80% of Americans say the global financial system unfairly favors powerful interests.” In addition, 67% said that the financial system needs a major overhaul. Interestingly, younger Americans are most likely to favor cryptocurrency and view it as a worthwhile asset for the future.
With the various challenges presented over the last couple of decades, including the 2008 financial crisis, the COVID-19 lockdowns and subsequent economic fallout, unsurprisingly, “Among U.S. adults, the top word associations with the global financial system are ‘expensive’ (34%), ‘unfair’ (30%), and ‘confusing’ (30%).”

20% of Americans own cryptocurrency, “which has remained consistent each quarter since January 2022,” the survey states. Despite the downturn in the broader cryptocurrency market as a result of various bankruptcies and failures in 2022, Americans consistently express interest in owning digital assets. Another interesting note is that current investors who already hold digital assets still hold a favorable view, with 84% likely to buy cryptocurrency over the next 12 months.

Many Bitcoiners have demonstrated the various ways in which the fiat monetary system exhibits the attributes that these respondents have applied to it. The survey is further evidence that changes to the monetary system are not only needed, but embraced by people who have been living under a fiat system their entire lives.]]></summary>

Inscribing bits of data onto the Bitcoin blockchain through Ordinals has captured the attention of cryptocurrency enthusiasts inside and beyond Bitcoin since the start of 2023. 
Whether or not Bitcoin “should” be used for this NFT-like activity is a hotly-contested issue and the data coming from the effects of this mini Bitcoin collectives craze is intriguing. Inscriptions could be a short-lived fad, but several early data sets from the first weeks of inscription activity show tremendous interest in this new use case for the Bitcoin network. Diving in, this article provides an overview of six sets of data from the inscription mania.

The digital asset has been heavily scrutinized following the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Wells Notice against its issuer, Paxos.
 
 
Coinbase Succumbs To The Pressure?
 
As Bitcoinist has been reporting, Paxos was accused by the SEC of allegedly violating investor protection laws when issuing Binance USD (BUSD). The Commission claims that BUSD, and many other tokens in the crypto ecosystem, is a security.
 
Therefore, Paxos allegedly needed to register the product with the SEC. This legal action from the U.S. regulator forced the crypto firm to cut ties with its long-term partner, crypto exchange Binance, and to stop issuing BUSD.

While the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) opinion on the industry might not be the former, it is also not that far away from the latter. On Sunday, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva in an interview with Bloomberg expressed the organization’s stance on the cryptocurrency market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu started the week trading marginally higher, despite cryptocurrencies mostly consolidating on Feb. 27. At the time of writing, the global market cap is currently up 0.83%, as volatility has intensified. Litecoin also rebounded on Monday, hitting a four-day high.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) continued to move away from a recent support point to start the week, as prices rose marginally higher on Monday.
 
Following a low $0.0000124 on Sunday, SHIB/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.00001307 earlier today.
 
This move comes as the meme coin bounced from its long-term price floor at the $0.00001230 mark.
 
 
Overall, SHIB is down 7% in the last seven days, and this comes following a downward cross of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) of 14 days has also failed to move past a ceiling at the 52.00 mark
 
The index is now tracking at 50.44, which comes after bulls rejected a breakout of a floor at 49.00.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
In addition to SHIB, litecoin (LTC) also climbed higher, hitting a four-day high in the process.
 
LTC/USD moved to a peak of $95.58 to start the week, after ending the weekend trading at a bottom of $93.79.
 
As a result of today’s gains, the token is now trading at its strongest point since last week, Thursday.
 
 
The initial move came following a breakout of a resistance point of 50.00 on the RSI indicator.
 
As of writing, the index is hovering slightly above this mark, with a current reading of 50.43.
 
LTC has since declined, and is now at $94.64, which appears to be a result of price strength tracking near a ceiling.
