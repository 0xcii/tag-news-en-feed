        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced price declines of over 10% this week. The downtrend experienced by these meme coins is likely due to the macro side, which has cast doubts in the minds of crypto investors.

According to Reuters, the decision came after Binance appointed a local representative to handle all legal proceedings related to the allegations. However, the exchange and the two executives still face separate charges of money laundering.
 
Money Laundering Allegations Persist
 
Tigran Gambaryan, a US citizen and head of financial crimes compliance at Binance, and Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British-Kenyan national serving as a regional manager for Africa, had vehemently denied the tax evasion accusations.
