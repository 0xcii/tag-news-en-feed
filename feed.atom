opposed to extremely volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum,  
are intended to have a steady value, sometimes tethered to a fiat currency such  
as the US dollar. Because of this stability, stablecoins are increasingly being  
used for a variety of purposes, including online transactions, remittances, and  
as a store of value. However, as the global economy faces uncertainty and the  
risk of a downturn, the question of whether stablecoins are recession-proof  
arises.
The Ascension

Stablecoins  
have gained popularity in recent years, owing to their stability and usability. They provide the advantages of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taiwanese law enforcement recently revealed the seizure of more than 320 million USDT stablecoins from an alleged money launderer. The seizure has been described as Taiwan’s largest bust ever from a single individual.
 
Lamborghini and a Lexus Seized
 
Taiwan’s law enforcement recently said it nabbed the four individuals behind what is being described as the region’s “largest virtual currency money laundering syndicate.” In a statement, the region’s law enforcement bodies said one of those arrested who is only identified as Qiu is said to have laundered more than 320 million USDT stablecoins. Three more individuals were also arrested alongside Qiu, the statement added.
 
According to a local language report, the now-seized funds relate to an investment fraud case operated by Qiu which was uncovered back in October 2022. However, despite the unmasking fraud scheme, law enforcement agents did not immediately arrest Qiu who is said to have frequently travelled to Malaysia and other South East Asian countries.
 
 
However, it was upon his return to Taiwan in June 2023 that agents finally detained Qiu and his accomplices and seized their mobile phones. As stated in the report, officials only discovered the extent of Qiu’s money laundering activities after they examined the accused’s mobile phones. As per the report, the value of the virtual currency during the raid on Qiu is believed to be the highest amount ever seized from one individual.
 
Besides the virtual currency, Taiwanese law enforcement is reported to have recovered two vehicles, a Lamborghini URUS and a Lexus LM luxury from Qiu’s residence. Laptops, credit cards, drugs, and three expensive watches were also seized.
 
Meanwhile, prosecutors from the Taichung District Prosecutor’s Office are said to have set Qiu’s bail at just over $3,000 and $600 for one of his accomplices.
