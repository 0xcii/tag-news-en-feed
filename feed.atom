        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana was up by as much as 15% on Tuesday, as momentum in cryptocurrency markets shifted higher. The global crypto market cap is up by 4.42% at the time of writing. Litecoin was another notable mover, as the token rose to a five-week high.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rose by as much as 15% in today’s session, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets.
 
Following a low of $20.18 to start the week, SOL/USD rose to a peak of $23.20 on Tuesday.
 
As a result of today’s move, solana rose to its strongest point since March 20, when the token was at a high of $23.99.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that today’s move coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moving beyond a ceiling at 58.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 63.74, which is marginally below a higher resistance level of 64.00.
 
Should solana bulls take the RSI beyond this point, then there is a good chance that price could move above $24.00.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
In addition to SOL, litecoin (LTC) was another notable gainer on Tuesday, as the token moved to a multi-week high.
 
LTC/USD jumped to a high of $96.89 earlier in today’s session, which comes after trading at a bottom of $92.37 on Monday.
 
Tuesday’s surge saw litecoin climb to its highest level since March 2, when LTC was trading at $98.34.
 
 
Looking at the chart, prices briefly rose above a key resistance level of $95.50, however as the session has progressed, these gains have been lost.
 
At the time of writing, LTC is trading at $95.41, which remains 2.61% higher than Monday’s low.
