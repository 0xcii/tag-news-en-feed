        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Allbridge was reportedly the victim of the most recent theft to sweep the industry, with Peckshield, a blockchain security company, claiming that $570,000 was stolen from the cross-chain protocol.
 
The theft of $282,889 in Binance USD and $290,868 in Tether USDT was discovered on April 1 and reported by Peckshield to Allbridge.
 
The company claims that the hacker stole $570,000 in cryptocurrency by serving as a liquidity provider and a swapper to artificially inflate the swap price of the pool.
 
The Allbridge hack was confirmed by Certik, another blockchain security company. An estimated $549,874 was stolen by manipulating the swap price in the company’s liquidity pool, according to internal reports.

The reason for the slump in the price is probably the news that the members of the OPEC+ oil alliance announced a surprise cut in oil production on Sunday. Led by Saudi Arabia, which wants to produce 500,000 barrels per day less, production will be lower by a total of one million barrels per day from May.

Despite a modest 4% gain over the past week, IntoTheBlock data shows that over 60% of Dogecoin holders are making a profit on their investments, while roughly 34% have lost money.
 
But, the most interesting discovery made by the analytics organization is the growing number of holders who are in it for the long haul and now possess tens of billions of DOGE.
