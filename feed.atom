The move, which takes effect on December 15, 2023, is a result of regulatory pressure that Paxos, the BUSD issuer, had to deal with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the complex realm of cryptocurrency regulation, the  
U.S. Treasury has boldly extended its reach, seeking  
expanded powers that transcend national borders. Deputy Secretary of the  
Treasury Wally Adeyemo's impassioned plea to Congress for extraterritorial  
control over stablecoins, notably targeting Tether, adds a layer of complexity  
to the ongoing domestic regulatory conundrum.
As Adeyemo presents a set of common-sense  
recommendations, it underscores the inherent challenges faced by the U.S. in  
regulating its burgeoning crypto industry. While the nation grapples with  
internal complexities, the audacious move raises a thought-provoking question:  
Can a country entrenched in domestic crypto intricacies successfully navigate  
the intricate global landscape?

Bitcoin had nearly two years of low transaction fees from the lack of demand to actually send Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin is considered to be the most secure blockchain in the world, but that security depends on miners who receive their revenue from transaction fees and block rewards. As part of the predetermined supply schedule, the block rewards are expected to be halved around April 2024 which would further drastically cut the miner revenue. To support the miners, Bitcoin needed something new to spur growth, and that was Ordinals. Ordinals drove huge demand to send Bitcoin transactions.

A significant feature of Solana is its ability to process multiple transactions concurrently through ‘parallel execution’. This method stands in contrast to the sequential processing found in many other blockchains like Ethereum.

Crypto Expert Believes XRP Price Is Suppressed
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, pro-XRP crypto YouTuber Jerry Hall stated that he believes that the price of the token has been suppressed for years. He noted that the moment he began to have this belief was when he realized that Ripple was selling into the market on a monthly basis. 
 
 
According to him, the fact that Ripple does this to finance their business shows that he and the company have different goals. He also seemed to suggest that Ripple didn’t care about XRP holders as he stated that “bag holders are …]]></summary>

million of these assets are from Grayscale's primary offering, the Grayscale

The approval, dated November 29 and issued by a

holdings in trusts managed by Grayscale Investments and Bitwise. It marks a  
significant step in repaying creditors impacted by the collapse of the

The authorization was prompted by a motion filed by  
FTX's debtors on November 3, requesting the sale of six cryptocurrency trusts,

The company initially entered the Bitcoin market in August 2020, making a significant initial investment of $250 million into BTC. Since then, they have consistently added to their Bitcoin holdings, creating a treasury reserve strategy that has garnered over 174,530 bitcoin worth more than $6.59 billion at the time of writing.
“On November 30, 2023, MicroStrategy announced that, during the period between November 1, 2023 and November 29, 2023, MicroStrategy, together with its subsidiaries, acquired approximately 16,130 bitcoins for approximately $593.3 million in cash, at an average price of approximately $36,785 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses,” MicroStrategy stated. “As of November 29, 2023, MicroStrategy, together with its subsidiaries, held an aggregate of approximately 174,530 bitcoins, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.280 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $30,252 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.”
