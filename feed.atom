Bitcoin halving, often referred to as “the halvening,” is a scheduled event that occurs approximately every four years, or after every 210,000 blocks are mined. During a halving, the rewards that Bitcoin miners receive for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain are slashed in half.

Data sourced from cryptoslam.io reveals that NFT sales on the Ethereum platform took the lion’s share, accounting for $38.10 million of the week’s turnover.
