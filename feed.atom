        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto market is an intricate shade of varying investment strategies and market behaviors, weaving together patterns that create the volatile landscape that has come to be associated with digital currencies. 
 
One thread within this complexity is the activity of short-term Bitcoin holders, who, despite modest profit margins, are keen to sell as Bitcoin stalls around $30,000.
 
The recent price lull has sparked a reevaluation among investors, specifically those who’ve managed to turn a profit in the month’s relatively stagnant market. Short-term holders (STHs), defined as entities holding onto their Bitcoin for 155 days or less, are the ones primarily driving this shift in market behavior.

This move comes after several other major players in the financial industry have also made similar filings, cementing Bitcoin's position as a sought-after asset among traditional investors.
The momentum began with BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset management firms, filing for a spot bitcoin ETF application. Although they were not the first — ARK Investments and 21Shares had already filed for a spot ETF — they initiated the cascading effect now seen. Investment firms Bitwise and Invesco both refiled for their own spot ETFs, which they had submitted previously.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, old hands have spent $295 million worth of the asset in recent days. The relevant indicator here is the “revived supply last active 1+ years,” which measures the total amount of tokens (in USD) that Bitcoin investors holding since at least one year ago are transferring/moving on the blockchain right now.
 
The 1+ years group forms a segment of a larger cohort: the “long-term holders” (LTHs). The LTHs include all investors who bought their coins more than 155 days ago. Therefore, the 1+ years group includes the more experienced…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-29T16:00:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana surged 10% on June 29, after it was confirmed that a new cross-chain bridge will allow users easier access to other blockchains. The update from Debridge will reportedly enable solana users to access ethereum’s virtual machine for the first time. Bitcoin cash extended its own gains on Thursday.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was a notable mover in today’s session, as the price rose by over 10%.
 
Following a low of $15.75 during Wednesday’s session, SOL/USD jumped to a peak of $18.20 earlier in the day.
 
This resulted in the world’s ninth largest cryptocurrency climbing to its highest point in the past 20 days.
 
 
As a result of the rally, the 10-day (red) moving average is now on the cusp of an upward crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) appears to be nearing a breakout of a resistance point around the 51.00 level.
 
The index is currently tracking at 50.87, with SOL at $17.35, after giving up earlier gains.
 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was in the green on Thursday, racing to a fresh multi-month high in the process.
 
BCH/USD surged to an intraday high of $247.64 earlier in the day, a day after dropping to a bottom at $223.50.
 
As a result of this latest rally, BCH moved to its strongest point since May 11 last year, when price peaked at $249.00.
 
 
This latest move comes as the RSI once again broke out of a ceiling at the 80.00 level, after dropping below this point the day prior.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 81.72, which remains deep in overbought territory, and could prompt bears to reenter the market.
 
Despite this, traders will likely attempt to reach a target at $250.00 first, before any inevitable sell-offs.
