        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty had once highlighted XRP’s unique positioning in the US following Ripple’s notable victories against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). His statement has more backing now as Americans seem to have taken more interest in the crypto token since then. 
 
Americans More Interested In XRP Than Ethereum
 
According to recent data from Google Trends, residents in 48 out of the 50 states in the country seem to be more interested in the XRP token over the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum. Nevada, Delaware, Montana, Louisiana, and Arizona form part of the regions where the interest in XRP is at the most.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, the Federal Reserve sent Bitcoin Magazine a cease and desist letter in an attempt to silence criticism of its recently launched FedNow interbank clearing and settlement service. The central bank of the United States is claiming that Bitcoin Magazine merchandise that parodies its services are not protected speech, but rather an unauthorized infringement of its image and trademarks.
The Federal Reserve alleges that Bitcoin Magazine used the trademark without permission to mislead readers into believing a connection exists between the publication and the central bank. While previous Bitcoin Magazine coverage of the Federal Reserve, particularly pertaining to its FedNow service, says otherwise. 
“But what is a FedNow? It is actually a scam,” said Bitcoin Magazine’s Isabella Santos, …]]></summary>

for securities trades next May. While this move is expected to have a positive  
impact, it brings significant concerns for over $1 trillion in Exchange-Traded

According to a report by Bloomberg, this step could  
pose challenges for ETFs, especially those holding overseas assets. As the

According to their analysis, Bitcoin has broken through crucial resistance levels and is currently poised to strengthen its momentum. Notably, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has surged above the 70 level, a development that, based on historical trends, could indicate the potential for another substantial upward move.
 
 
“The RSI is now beginning to be overbought and could stretch higher toward the 100 mark, as it is the norm with bullish markets. In other words, as long as it sustains the uptrend, the BTC price would be inclined to keep the rally intact,” Happel and Allemann explained.

world. Bitcoin has continually demonstrated endurance and growth since its  
creation, despite its well-known price volatility and occasional setbacks. 
For starters,  
Bitcoin's allure stems from its scarcity and cyclical halving events. It is a
