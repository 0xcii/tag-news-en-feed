        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent developments, Electricite du Laos (EDL) announced on August 24 that the power company shut down cryptocurrency mining activities. This decision came after this summer’s unprecedented heat surge escalated electricity demands. Furthermore, these mining operations have reportedly been defaulting on their debts.
 
Laos’ Crypto Mining Grinds to a Halt Amid Energy Crisis
 
Situated in Southeast Asia, Laos, surrounded by nations like Myanmar, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand, has reportedly halted its crypto mining. Interestingly, Laos relies on hydropower for a significant 95% of the country’s electricity generation.
 
Over the first half of 2023, EDL’s hydropower stations have been overwhelmed with electricity consumption. The scorching heat is a major factor driving this soaring demand. But that’s not all; the Laos government states that regional mining activities haven’t cleared their dues. Notably, Laos has been increasingly open to cryptocurrency operations since 2021.
 
As highlighted by Vietnam Plus, back in September 2021, the Laotian government green-lighted six companies to dive into crypto mining and trading. Fast forward to January 2022, the Bank of Laos endorsed two crypto trading platforms, Lao Digital Assets Exchange (LDX) and Bitqik, setting them apart as the nation’s sole regulated entities offering comprehensive cryptocurrency services.
 
 
By May 2022, Laos inaugurated a dedicated cryptocurrency mining venture in its Champasack Province. This landmark event was spearheaded by Lao Crypto Mining in collaboration with AIF Group. As of August 2022, projections showed Laos raking in nearly $190 million in tax revenues from crypto-related operations by year’s end. However, the recent shutdown report leaves us in the dark about its duration and the outstanding amount owed by the mining businesses.

In a tweet on August 26, Ardoino, dismissing speculations and rumors, said the site is “progressing well, and everyone in the team is super excited and working around the clock to start operations in the next few weeks.” However, to prevent unnecessary “harassment,” the CTO chose not to divulge the exact location of the mining farm.

Yet, the overseeing U.S. bankruptcy judge, Martin Glenn, dismissed this proposal. Consequently, Celsius’s creditors are rallying to set the token’s worth at a more modest $0.25 apiece.
 
Judge Denies Several Motions in Celsius Bankruptcy Case
 
During the Celsius legal proceedings, creditors pushed for CEL’s valuation to reflect its pre-bankruptcy rate of $0.80. They contended that CEL’s worth had been artificially tampered with. Despite their fervent arguments, judge Glenn was unconvinced and shot down the motion, among several others.

The scam unfolded when an observant on-chain investigator detected a transaction that would set the stage for the grand deception.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a revealing report published on August 24, 2023, a significant oversight by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) was brought to light. In their endeavor to manage assets confiscated from a nefarious enterprise, the DEA mistakenly funneled funds to an unrelated scammer, falling prey to a notorious crypto dusting scam.
 
Blockchain Blunder: DEA Mistakenly Transfers $55K to Crafty Scammer
 
Previously this year, the DEA suffered a setback, losing over $50,000 to a rampant cryptocurrency con. This hefty sum had been seized over a long three-year probe into the use of digital currencies for suspected drug money laundering, as chronicled by Forbes’ Thomas Brewster.
 
Come May, the DEA undertook a massive seizure, capturing nearly $500,000 in the stable cryptocurrency, tether (USDT). This operati…]]></summary>

Folk music artist Oliver Anthony took the internet by storm with a video of his song “Rich Men North of Richmond,” recorded in the woods near his off-grid home in Virginia, and has created something resembling the Bitcoin song of the year. Anthony’s raw emotion and lamentation of the “new world” along with his observation that “the dollar ain’t shit” has certainly aided him in receiving accolades from the Bitcoin community.
It’s of course no coincidence that Bitcoiners gravitated toward this song given its criticism of “rich men North of Richmond” — glares at the Washington uni-party — but what I find most important is Anthony’s cathartic, grieving tone. …]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-26T14:17:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was one of Saturday’s notable gainers, as price rebounded from recent lows to start the weekend. Today’s rebound comes as the global crypto market cap moved into the green earlier in the session. XRP was also higher on Saturday.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) moved away from a recent support point to start the weekend, as bulls opted to buy a recent dip in price.
 
Following a low of $0.000008016 on Friday, SHIB/USD rose to an intraday peak of $0.00000822 on Saturday.
 
As a result, shiba inu moved away from the aforementioned price floor around the $0.00000790 zone.
 
 
The bounce comes as the relative strength index (RSI) also avoided a support of its own at 39.00, and has now jumped to a reading of 43.27.
 
A ceiling of 47.00 now awaits traders in the event that bullish momentum intensifies during the weekend.
 
 
XRP
 
Additionally, XRP was also in the green, rebounding from recent losses of its own.
 
XRP/USD rose to a high of $0.5298 to start the weekend, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $0.5128.
 
Similar to shiba inu above, the rise in price sees the meme coin attempt to move beyond a recent floor at $0.5045.
 
 
Earlier gains have somewhat eased, however, as the RSI collided with a resistance level of 35.00, with price falling to a current reading of $0.5235.
 
In the event that this ceiling is broken, bulls will most likely be targeting exits around the $0.5435 zone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been speculations that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could drag Ripple Labs’ founders into the regulator’s long-running legal battle against their company. However, pro-XRP legal expert Fred Rispoli has outlined why this is unlikely.
 
SEC Unlikely To Sue Ripple Founders
 
Rispoli stated in a tweet that the SEC is unlikely to pursue a trial against Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen for “many reasons.” 
 
 
 
 
The agency had accused Ripple Labs of selling unregistered securities back in 2020. But although it highlighted Garlinghouse and Larsen as integral to the wrongdoing, it never brought an action specifically against the duo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin remained largely unchanged on Saturday, as markets were mostly unmoved by comments from the Federal Reserve’s chair, Jerome Powell. Speaking at the annual Jackson Hole symposium, Powell hinted that more hikes were in the cards. Ethereum moved back towards a recent support point.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin continued to trade near the $26,000 region to start the weekend, as markets failed to react to Jerome Powell’s comments at the Jackson Hole symposium.
 
Powell stated that, “We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $25,914.93 on the comments, following Friday’s high at $26,406.15.
 
 
Price has since moved back above $26,000, as the relative strength index (RSI) began to trend sideways.
 
As of writing, price strength is now tracking at 25.71, which is closer to a ceiling of 29.00 than a floor of 20.00.
 
Should the index move beyond the 29.00 level, there could be more bulls reentering the market.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) edged lower on Saturday, as traders were underwhelmed by yesterday’s speech by the Fed chair.
 
Following a peak at $1,665.14 during yesterday’s session, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,641.63 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the decline, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moved below a support point of $1,650.
 
 
This week has seen ETH mostly trade between a low of $1,580 and a high of $1,690, with some occasional breakouts.
 
For bulls, a surge will need to occur at the resistance level of 33.00 on the RSI, in order for momentum to truly shift upward.

By this technique, hackers manipulate mobile carrier customer service to gain access to a user’s phone number, allowing them to bypass security measures and access accounts. Bart Stephens, co-founder of Blockchain Capital, fell victim to a SIM-swap attack, resulting in a $6.3 million Bitcoin theft. He has filed a lawsuit against the hackers. From all this it’s clear there’s a lack of effective safeguards and timely notifications from mobile phone carriers.
