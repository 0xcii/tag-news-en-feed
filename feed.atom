        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e7474e62e2f</id>
        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-fear-and-greed-index-hits-near-extreme-fear-a-buying-opportunity"/>
        <updated>2024-08-05T20:51:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest data from Bitcoin Magazine Pro's Fear and Greed Index reveals that Bitcoin sentiment has dropped to a near "extreme fear" level, scoring 26 out of 100. Historically, such a low score suggests a potential buying opportunity for savvy investors, as market sentiment indicates undervaluation and widespread caution.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
The Fear and Greed Index is a tool for assessing market sentiment, analyzing factors like volatility, momentum, social media trends, and Bitcoin's dominance over other cryptocurrencies. To help investors gauge when to buy or sell Bitcoin, the index ranges from:
0-24: Extreme fear (red)
25-46: Fear (amber)
46-49: Neutral (yellow)
50-74: Greed (light green)
75-100: Extreme greed (green)
Bitcoin's current score of 26 reflects heightened market anxiety, coinciding with a recent -25% price drop for Bitcoin this week. Despite this, historical trends suggest that periods of extreme fear often precede price rebounds, making it an opportune moment for strategic investments. The index has been a reliable indicator, showing that excessive fear typically signals undervalued conditions, whereas extreme greed may indicate overvaluation.
The consistent tracking of fear and greed levels can potentially provide valuable insights, allowing investors to navigate the volatile Bitcoin market more effectively. As the Bitcoin market continues to evolve, tools like the Fear and Greed Index remain essential for understanding market dynamics and making informed investment choices.

Yes, you read that right. In fact, not only was it not banned, but Chinese miners are leading the world in innovative uses of Bitcoin mining.
But what of this Reuters report and others that says it was banned?
Let’s have a closer look.
Yes, network hashrate dropped from 179.2 EH/s to 87.7 EH/s (a 51.1% drop) seemingly confirming that China banned mining.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
After all, China was according to Cambridge 46% of global hashrate the month prior to the “ban” (April 2021). So the figures roughly tally up with the thesis that “mining has been banned in China.”

JUST IN: Capula Management, Europe's fourth largest investment manager, discloses it owns $500 million in spot #Bitcoin ETFs 🇪🇺 pic.twitter.com/AarPOFjrbt
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 5, 2024
  
  
  
The firm reported owning $211 million in Fidelity's spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) and $253 million in BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), totaling $464 million. Capula's significant investment in Bitcoin ETFs reflects a further growing acceptance of Bitcoin among traditional financial institutions.
This investment aligns with a broader trend of institutional adoption, as more firms seek exposure to the potential upside of BTC. The SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has made it easier for institutions to invest in Bitcoin, providing a more accessible and regulated vehicle for participation in this burgeoning market.
