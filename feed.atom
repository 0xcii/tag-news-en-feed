        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On May 9, digital currency fund manager Grayscale Investments announced the establishment of the Grayscale Funds Trust and submitted registration filings for three exchange-traded funds with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Grayscale Introduces Grayscale Funds Trust and Files for 3 ETFs
 
As the leading digital currency fund manager, in terms of assets under management (AUM), Grayscale Investments unveiled the Grayscale Funds Trust launch. The trust is a Delaware statutory trust structure designed to strengthen the company’s worldwide asset management capabilities. “A registration statement relating to Grayscale Funds Trust has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective,” Grayscale stated on Tuesday.
 
Grayscale highlighted that they had previously established Grayscale Advisors, an SEC-registered investment advisor, which will serve as the new trust’s advisor. Besides the trust, Grayscale has also filed a registration statement for three additional funds. These newly launched funds consist of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, and Grayscale Privacy ETF.
 
Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in a statement: “The creation of Grayscale Funds Trust reflects our dedication to scaling Grayscale’s business responsibly,” adding that “we are putting the necessary foundations in place so Grayscale can continue creating and managing regulated, future-forward products.”
 
 
Moreover, Grayscale announced that David LaValle, the company’s global head of ETFs, would assist with their expansion. “It has been incredibly exciting to build our ETF franchise – hiring a dedicated team, expanding our partnerships, and enhancing our position within the ETF ecosystem,” LaValle said.

Biden posted an infographic on Twitter that reads:
 

“We think Congress should cut tax loopholes to make crypto investors rich… MAGA Republicans think Congress should cut food safety inspections ($15 billion).”
 
According to the infographic, such adjustments would ostensibly save the government $18 billion. However, Biden did not specify which tax exemptions would be closed by reforms to generate these savings.

Unsurprisingly, the tweet has been met with fierce opposition in the community. While some community members doubted the veracity of the figure, Scott Melker wrote that Biden should first return his campaign donations from FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried before makin…]]></summary>

Recently, I’ve been thinking a good deal about Balaji Srinivasan’s $1 million dollar bet that bitcoin would reach $1 million in June (which he recently conceded), his apparent hyperbole with regard to imminent U.S. dollar hyperinflation and his musings about digital lockdowns. It all sounds a bit far-fetched to me. 
On this score, he reminds me of Peter Schiff, a man who for decades has told us the sky is falling and that the world will end as fiat currencies all collapse; a man who claims intellectual superiority over the “fools” at the Federal Reserve (meanwhile and generally speaking, the global economy hums along and collapse appears, at leas…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was hovering close to a key price floor near $27,300 on Wednesday, as markets anticipated the upcoming U.S. inflation report. Consumer prices for last month are expected to remain at 5%, which could be seen as justifying the Federal Reserve’s decision to hike rates last week. Ethereum remained above $1,800. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to consolidate on Wednesday, as markets awaited the latest inflation report from the United States.
 
Following a high of $27,824.39 on Tuesday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,375.60 earlier in today’s session.
 
Today’s move pushed bitcoin close to a key support point at $27,300, however prices have since rebounded.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, it appears that the previous drop took place following a breakout on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Price strength moved below a floor at 43.00, with the index tracking at 42.63 at the time of writing.
 
Bitcoin is now trading at $27,607.96.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum also hovered close to a support point of its own in today’s session, as overall market sentiment remained uncertain.
 
ETH/USD hit a bottom of $1,835.70 on Wednesday, which comes a few days removed from price trading above $2,000.
 
Overall, ethereum is now in the red for a fifth consecutive day, and is down nearly 10% within that period.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This recent run has sent the 25-day (blue) moving average (MA) lower, with the trend line fast approaching its 10-day (red) counterpart.
 
Although longer-term momentum is slowing, the fact that the 10-day MA is below the 25-day line, means an upwards crossover could lead to a bull run.
 
Should this occur, there is a good chance that the target for bulls will be to recapture the $2,000 point.

Bitcoin Miners Haven’t Transferred Much Volume Towards Exchanges Recently
 
The transaction fees on the Bitcoin network have shot up recently because of the increased traffic caused by the Ordinals, a protocol that allows data to be inscribed into the Bitcoin blockchain with transactions.
 
Generally, the transaction fees remain low during times when there is little activity on the blockchain as investors have no need to pay higher fees to get transfers through quickly.
 
However, when the network is congested, however, waiting times in the mempool can stretch longer, so the senders who want their transfers to be processed faster attach a hig…]]></summary>

The billionaire behind Unreal Engine and Fortnite, Sweeney came to Twitter on May 9 to mock PR agency CEO Ed Zitron’s article titled, “RIP Metaverse, we hardly knew ye,” which saw print on Insider earlier this week.
 
According to the article, the “once-buzzy technology… died after being abandoned by the business world.” Zitron believes that Horizon Worlds, Meta’s virtual reality platform, hasn’t lived up to its “grand promise” of becoming the internet of the future.
 
Contrary to Zitron’s claims, Sweeney said that 600 million people use virtual worlds like Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, The Sandbox, and VR Chat.

"There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>
