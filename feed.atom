Despite the overall market turbulence and significant selloffs, the dog-themed cryptocurrency has experienced a noticeable uptick in large transactions over the last 24 hours.
 
This interesting trend surrounding Shiba Inu is noted through data from IntoTheBlock, an on-chain analytics platform. Notably, the platform’s ‘Large Transaction Volume’ metric reveals an impressive 34.5% rise in the volume of large transactions in the past 24 hours.
