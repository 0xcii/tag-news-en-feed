        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent weeks, Treasury yields have skyrocketed, igniting a Wall Street dispute over whether the precipitous sell-off is now overextended. A small group of prominent investors are wagering that bond prices will bounce back following the abrupt escalation in rates.
 
Hedge Funds Place Bold Wagers Against Treasuries Amid Soaring Yields
 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan contend that the recent plunge in Treasuries has been excessive, urging investors to seize the opportunity to buy. Warren Buffett, unfazed by Fitch’s downgrade of U.S. debt, persists in purchasing billions in Treasuries weekly for Berkshire Hathaway.

        <updated>2023-08-08T13:02:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded on Tuesday, following the news that Paypal was launching a USD stablecoin on the ethereum blockchain. The company hopes the move will bridge the gap between fiat and cryptocurrencies for all of its stakeholders. Ethereum was marginally higher today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was back in the green on Tuesday, as the cryptocurrency made marginal gains during today’s session.
 
The move came as Paypal announced its USD stablecoin, which will be hosted on the ethereum blockchain.
 
Following the news, CEO Dan Schulman said: “Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through Paypal USD.”
 
 
BTC/USD rose to a peak of $29,402.65 on the news, following a low of $28,724.14 the day prior.
 
Today’s peak sees bitcoin trade at its highest point since last Wednesday, when it was last above $30,000.
 
Tuesday’s rally has also brought the 10-day (red) moving average to the cusp of an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rose marginally after the Paypal news, with price moving away from a recent support point.
 
Following a low of $1,804.72 to start the week, ETH/USD jumped to an intraday high of $1,836.06 on Tuesday.
 
Despite the slight rise in price, ethereum continues to trade below a recent resistance level of $1,850.
 
 
A positive for bulls, however, comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of its ceiling at the 43.00 mark.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at a reading of 43.88, with the next resistance zone near the 50.00 point.
 
In the event this target is reached, ETH will likely be back above $1,900.

Recently, Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, successfully implemented Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to enhance the speed and scalability of Bitcoin transactions on its platform. This came after it was forced to halt bitcoin withdrawals for several hours in May 2023 due to a sudden surge in transaction volume, which led to an increase in processing fees.
This integration for Binance marked a significant milestone, as it prompted introductions and deepening talks about the Lightning Network as a long-term solution for managing substantial transaction volumes in the future.
