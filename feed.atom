        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu moved to a five-week high during Tuesday’s session, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly consolidating. As of writing, the global crypto market cap is trading 0.20% lower, however the meme coin is up by nearly 5%. Apecoin also surged in today’s session, as it rose to its strongest point since November.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was one of Tuesday’s notable gainers, as prices of the token rose for a sixth straight session.
 
SHIB/USD surged to an high of $0.000009593 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $0.000008603.
 
As a result of this latest surge in price, shiba inu climbed to its highest point since December 5.
 
 
From the chart, it appears as though today’s rally came following an upwards crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has risen above a recent ceiling at 65.50.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 67.50, with the next visible ceiling at the 73.00 zone.
 
 
Apecoin (APE)
 
Apecoin (APE) was another big mover in today’s session, extending recent gains to a fifth consecutive day.
 
Following a low of $4.50 to start the week, APE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $4.98 earlier in the day.
 
The move pushed apecoin to its highest level since November 5, and came following a breakout of a price ceiling at $4.60.
 
 
As a result of today’s surge, the RSI on the APE chart is now at its strongest point on record, with a reading of 79.09.
 
This means that prices are now deep in overbought territory, which could mean that bears are preparing for reentry.
 
Despite this potential reversal, bulls are seemingly still targeting a ceiling at $5.30, which hasn’t been hit since October 11.

According to a report from Reuters, this is the company’s third round of layoffs as macroeconomic conditions and persistent downside pressure the nascent sector. 
 
 
Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, explained the restructuring strategy and the motivations behind the decision to cut down on his staff. The crypto exchange was founded in 2012, surviving multiple bear markets, but this is the first time a crypto winter coincides with a macroeconomic downturn. 
 
Coinbase Worry About More Crypto Contagion
 
Furthermore, Armstrong believes that the crypto exchange will benefit from recent events. However, there is still a short and medium-term risk.

NFT Dominance On Ethereum Has Climbed Up Recently
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the NFT dominance on Ethereum had dropped to only 13% just a while ago. The “dominance” here is based on the percentage of the total gas usage on the ETH network that a particular transaction type is consuming right now.
 
When the value of this metric increases for a specific type of token, it means that the token is now making up for a higher part of the total gas consumption on the Ethereum network and is, thus, seeing relatively higher usage from holders than the other transaction types.
