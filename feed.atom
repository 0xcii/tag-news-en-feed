These bridges serve as the vital connectors between various blockchain networks, enabling seamless interoperability and the transfer of assets and data across different chains. 
 
However, as the crypto industry continues to invest heavily in these bridges, Chainlink’s co-founder, Sergey Nazarov, has raised a red flag, asserting that most of these bridges are “absolutely not secure.”
 
Nazarov’s concerns highlight the significant implications of blockchain bridges and the urgent need for enhanced security measures within the crypto space.

While bitcoin's global popularity is undeniable, there's an emerging trend spotlighted in a recent survey conducted by Jack Dorsey's Block, Inc., in conjunction with Wakefield Research: developing nations are displaying a burgeoning optimism around bitcoin. 
The survey, covering 15 nations and garnering insights from 6,600 individuals, offers an intriguing snapshot of how bitcoin perceptions are evolving. Between 2022 and 2023, bitcoin underwent substantial price fluctuations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu snapped a recent four-day losing streak on Thursday, as bulls rejected a breakout below a key level of support. The slight rebound in price came as the global crypto market cap was marginally higher, climbing 0.25% as of writing. Dogecoin was also in the green.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) ended a four-day losing streak on Thursday, as crypto bulls returned following a slight stalemate earlier in the day.
 
Following a low of $0.000007164 on Thursday, SHIB/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.000007287 during today’s session.
 
This came as traders continued to move price away from a recent support point around the $0.00000710 level.
 
 
From the chart, it also appears that momentum is somewhat bullish, with the 10-day (red) moving average nearing a cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In order for this to happen, the relative strength index (RSI) will first need to rise beyond a ceiling at the 44.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 42.14, with SHIB trading at $0.000007256.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) also ended a winless run on Thursday, as the meme coin rallied following two days of declines.
 
DOGE/USD peaked at $0.06117 earlier in the day, which comes after a low of $0.06027 the day prior.
 
Similar to shiba inu, the moves comes as DOGE bounced away from a recent price floor at the $0.0600 level.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it seems as though the next target will be around the $0.0625 zone, which was last hit exactly a week ago.
 
In order to reach this point, price strength will need to climb from a current reading at 42.52, and head closer to a ceiling of 44.00.
