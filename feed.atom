Litecoin: The Unlikely Challenger Takes The Crown 
The crypto has surged to an all-time high (ATH) of 40% dominance as a payment option on BitPay. This dethrones the long-reigning champion, Bitcoin, which currently sits at a distant 24%, according to BitPay’s data.

Since early March, Ether has seen a dramatic increase in transaction volume, with a single day recording a staggering $50 billion – the highest level since 2022. This surge in activity has pushed transaction fees to a …]]></summary>
