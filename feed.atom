Particularly, unlike previous cycles, which bolstered new inventions, the current period is yet to introduce “transformative technologies” that typically drive mass adoption and enthusiasm, according to Blast founder Tieshun Roquerre, also known by his pseudonym, Pacman.
 
How Different Is This Crypto Cycle From The Past Ones?
 
Sharing his insights during a virtual Q&A session at the Foresight 2024 event in Hong Kong, Pacman highlighted several factors that differentiate the current cycle from previous ones. According to the expert, this cycle is strikingly …]]></summary>

According to recent data, the base fee paid by users has fallen to an astonishingly low 0.82 Gwei, a clear indication of reduced activity on the Ethereum network.
 
Rapid Decline In Ethereum Base Fees
 
Data from Ultra Sound Money reveals that Ethereum’s base gas fee experienced a continuous decline throughout last week, eventually hitting a multi-year low of 0.82 Gwei on Saturday, August 11. This significant drop in gas fees can be attributed to a decrease in large transactions on the Ethereum network.

The “mining hashrate” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that miners have currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. This metric is generally considered to represent the current situation of the BTC miners.
 
When the value of the indicator rises, it means new miners are joining the network and/or old ones are expanding their facilities. Such a trend implies the chain is looking attractive to these chain validators.
 
 
On the other hand, a decline in the metric suggests some miners have decided to disconnect from the network, potentia…]]></summary>

JUST IN: Marathon announces its now stamping each #Bitcoin block it mines with "Made in USA" 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/4ZbvChxdVY
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 12, 2024
 
 
 
Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, emphasized this commitment, stating, "Every block mined by MARA Pool in the USA is proudly stamped 'Made in USA'. We are the only large-scale miner who can do this because we run our own pool and ensure that all the blocks mined by MARA Pool are made in the USA."
This initiative coincides with comments made earlier this summer by Presidential candidate Donald Trump, who expressed a desire for "all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!!" as Trump believes more Bitcoin mining done in the country will contribute to America’s goal of becoming energy dominant. He also reiterated his support for domestic Bitcoin mining at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville, pledging to ensure that American miners receive the electricity needed to mine more Bitcoin here in the USA.

Earlier today, Marathon Digital announced a $250 million private offering of convertible notes, with the proceeds aimed at purchasing more Bitcoin, following the strategy of corporate Bitcoin accumulation pioneered by MicroStrategy.]]></summary>
