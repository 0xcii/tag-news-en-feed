Blockchain’s Role In China’s Digital Ambition
 
The call to action emphasizes enhancing China’s blockchain infrastructure to “bolster” various sectors, including “government services, supply chains, and trade.”
 
 
This suggestion comes when the digital economy is increasing, and the potential for blockchain technology to “revolutionize” data sharing and circulation is becoming increasingly apparent.

Bitcoin Has Seen Wild Price Action Since Setting New All-Time High
 
During the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has finally managed to achieve a new all-time high beyond the $69,000 level. Unlike what some may have hoped for, though, the break lasted only temporarily, with a crash following soon after.
 
 
The below chart shows how the price action in the cryptocurrency has looked like recently:
 

 
 
As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin’s latest crash was quite sharp, and during it, the asset’s price even witnessed a very brief venture below the $60,000 level. Since then, though, the cryptocurrency has enjoyed a quick rebound, as it’s now already trading …]]></summary>

Miners Fueled BTC ATH Rally
 
On Tuesday, March 5, 2024, BTC hit a new all-time high, soaring to $69,200, and surpassing its previous peak in November 2021 when the price of the cryptocurrency traded at around $69,000. This unprecedented price surge has been attributed to the strategic efforts and patience of early Bitcoin miners who recently sold off a considerable portion of their BTC holdings during this all-time high.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 6, 2024
 
 
 
On February 22, the bill passed the Senate's Third Reading in a 16-13 vote, and is now being reviewed by the House for the second time. 
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
The proposal emphasizes the importance of monitoring developments in Bitcoin ETFs, while also urging ASRS and PSPRS to consider the implications of including such assets in their portfolios. This includes consulting with firms approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer Bitcoin ETFs.
Additionally, ASRS and PSPRS would be required to submit a comprehensive report on the feasibility, risks, and potential benefits of directing a portion of state retirement system funds into Bitcoin ETFs. The report, which would include options and recommendations for safely investing in the asset class, would be submitted to key state officials at least three months before the beginning of the Fifty-Seventh Legislature, First Regular Session.
The proposal aims to provide ASRS and PSPRS with the information needed to make informed decisions about integrating Bitcoin ETFs into their investment strategies, potentially diversifying their portfolios and exploring new avenues for growth.]]></summary>
