        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After being the victim of a red wave on Thursday, XRP rebounded in today’s session, as crypto bulls remained resilient. The global market cap is up by 0.40% at the time of writing, following a 2% drop yesterday. Stellar was another strong mover on Friday, and is currently up 2.25% 
 
XRP
 
XRP was back in the green on Friday, after bulls abruptly ended a three-day win streak during yesterday’s session.
 
Following a low at $0.5025 on Thursday, XRP/USD moved to a peak at $0.5134 earlier in the day.
 
The surge saw XRP, formerly ripple, once again make strides towards a key resistance level at $0.5450.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) climbed back above a ceiling at 47.00.
 
At present, price strength is now sitting at 48.72, with the next visible ceiling near the 54.00 region.
 
In the event this target is hit, there is a strong likelihood that XRP moves above $0.5400.
 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
Stellar (XLM) was also in the green in today’s session, after two consecutive days of price declines.
 
XLM/USD peaked at $0.1154 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a low of $0.1122.
 
As a result of the decline, bulls continued to push the token away from a recent floor at $0.1100, and back on course toward resistance at $0.1320.
 
 
Today’s rebound was helped by the RSI reaching a floor of its own at 37.00, and it is now tracking at 39.87.
 
A ceiling at 44.00 now awaits bulls, and could be the main hurdle preventing further gains this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With just two weeks to his trial, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) appealed his bail revocation ruling, hoping he would attend his trial from home when it commences. However, that is unlikely following the Court of Appeals order on September 21.
 
Sam Bankman-Fried To Remain In Jail
 
A three-judge panel of Circuit Judges including John M. Walker, Jr., Denny Chin, and William J. Nardini ordered that SBF’s motion for release pending trial be denied. That means that Sam Bankman-Fried will remain in detention until his trial commences.
 
 
SBF and his lawyers had appealed Judge Lewis Kaplan’s (the Judge in charge of SBF’s case) ruling, where he revoked the FTX founder’s bail and ordered that he be detained at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) until his trial begins on Octobe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The anticipated Ethereum upgrade, dubbed Dencun, amalgamating the consensus layer (Deneb) and the execution layer (Cancun), is poised for a likely delay to early next year. The discussions during the Ethereum All Core Developers Consensus Call (ACDC) #118, chaired by Danny Ryan from the Ethereum Foundation, signposted this potential delay amid discussions surrounding the pivotal Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) such as EIP-4844. In a recent blog post, Galaxy Digital Vice President of Research, Christine Kim, highlighted the developments.

The news comes in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave the interest rate unchanged during its recent gathering of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, emphasized this week that the central bank’s strategy entails supporting “the policy rate and await further data.” He underlined the importance of maintaining a “restrictive policy” to achieve the desired goal of curbing inflation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, is currently drawing significant attention as it stands poised for a potential upward surge. Santiment, a leading blockchain analytics platform, has identified a pivotal factor that could pave the way for a substantial rally in Bitcoin’s price. 
 
This factor centers around the remarkable increase in short interest observed on two of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, igniting hopes of a short squeeze that could propel BTC’s value well beyond the $30,000 mark.
 
Santiment’s comprehensive analysis cited in a new report delves into the evolving landscape of Bitcoin trading, revealing a noteworthy development that has captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts and market observers alike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum continued to slip lower on Friday, as the cryptocurrency fell below the $1,600 level in today’s session. Crypto markets have mostly consolidated since the Federal Reserve opted to keep rates unchanged earlier this week, with the global market cap down nearly 1%, as of writing. Bitcoin continued to trend lower.
 
Bitcoin
 
After falling to its lowest point since Monday late in yesterday’s session, bitcoin (BTC) was marginally higher today.
 
BTC/USD fell to a low of $26,389.30 on Thursday, and at the time of writing, has rebounded to $26,641.77.
 
This, however, still remains below yesterday’s peak of $26,786.10, and almost $1,000 away from a recent three-week high.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
The decline comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell to a one-week low in the last 24 hours, before finding a stable floor.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 50.77, which is marginally above the aforementioned support at 50.00.
 
Should bulls opt to reenter after recent days of consolidation, they will likely target the 56.00 level on the indicator.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) fell below the $1,600 level in today’s session, as bearish pressure continued to intensify.
 
Following a high of $1,601.54 on Thursday, ETH/USD slipped to an intraday low $1,573.31 later in the day.
 
This was the lowest point ethereum had fallen to since September 12, when price bottomed out at $1,549.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Bulls have since bought this dip, with the world’s second largest cryptocurrency rebounding to a current level at $1,597.46.
 
As such, the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages have neared one another, with the prospect of an upward cross seeming imminent.
 
Should this occur, there could be a bull run in ETH this weekend.
