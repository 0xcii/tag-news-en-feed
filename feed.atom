The DOJ is now working on a plan to seize Robinhood Markets shares related with Sam Bankman-Fried, who was the founder and former chief executive officer of FTX.
 
These shares in contention are valued at around $465 million.
 
FTX creditors have launched judicial actions in an attempt to recover the shares. DOJ attorney Seth B. Shapiro stated that a court hearing will be scheduled to decide the disposition of the seized Robinhood shares and bank account assets.
 
The allegations that Bankman-Fried cheated consumers and investors have been officially refuted by him.

Shiba Inu Has Enjoyed Uptrend In The Past Day, While Solana Declines
 
2022 was an abysmal year for both Shiba Inu and Solana, as the cryptos both saw drawdowns of more than 70% in the year, with SOL being especially deeper into loss. 2023 has, however, been kinder to these coins as they are both in the green so far.
