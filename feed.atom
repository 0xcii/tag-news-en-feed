        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has accused Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the now-collapsed crypto exchange FTX, of leaking the private diary of Caroline Ellison, a former colleague, and CEO of sister trading firm Alameda Research. 
 
The leaked diary was published by the New York Times, shedding light on Ellison’s personal musings and her role as a key witness in Bankman-Fried’s upcoming trial. Ellison had previously pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the alleged fraud at FTX and agreed to cooperate, shortly after the exchange’s collapse.
 
 
The DOJ contends that Bankman-Fried’s intention behind this leak was to discredit Ellison and undermine her credibility as a witness, given her cooperation agreement with the prosecution.

This event takes place every four years, with the next one being scheduled to take place sometime next year. The exact estimates differ between different mining-related platforms, but in the context of the current discussion, the next halving is assumed to be taking place in about 280 days.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-races-to-highest-point-since-may-following-elon-musk-tweet/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-21T16:13:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was one of the standout gainers during a quiet session, as the meme coin raced to a multi-month high. Prices rose as traders continued to react to a recent tweet from Elon Musk. Another notable gainer was polkadot, which rose nearly 7% higher.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was a notable mover during Friday’s session, as the meme coin climbed to a multi-month high. This occurred as price continued its reaction to a recent Elon Musk tweet.
 
Following a low of $0.06855 on Thursday, DOGE/USD surged to an intraday peak of $0.07639 earlier today.
 
This resulted in dogecoin hitting its strongest point since May 6, when its price peaked above $0.0800.
 
 
One of the catalysts behind today’s move was a breakout of the 62.00 level on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is now at 64.24, with an upcoming resistance point of 66.00 a possible target for buyers.
 
Earlier momentum has marginally faded, with DOGE now trading at $0.074.
 
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Additionally, polkadot (DOT) also rallied to end the week, as the token rose by as much as 7% in today’s session.
 
DOT/USD jumped to a high of $5.69 on Friday, which was a day after the price fell to a bottom at $5.15.
 
As a result of this rally, polkadot peaked at its highest level since last Friday, when it reached a then two-month high of $5.74.
 
 
The token edged lower after bulls were unable to extend gains towards a key resistance level of $6.00.
 
Overall, this appeared to come as price strength failed to surge past its own ceiling at the 60.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the indicator is now closing in on this point, and in the event it breaks beyond this zone, DOT will likely climb past the $6.00 mark.
