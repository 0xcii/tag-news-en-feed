This is partly due to being seen as existing outside regular financial systems and, going back through crypto history, being outside regular systems really meant that, with early enthusiasts acquiring bitcoin peer-to-peer, sometimes even physically meeting up with sellers and paying in cash.
  
Such personal mechanisms don’t scale up to mass adoption, but they are bedded in the perception that Bitcoin, and crypto more widely, are separated from banking, financial services and, relatedly, from politics.
  
Times have changed though, and debate recently has centered on crypto’s access (or lack of access) to banking services and fiat on/off ramps. And, any perceived separation from politics is becoming a bygone chapter, as we increasingly see crypto…]]></summary>

Schlegel was asked to complete the sentences of the Swiss presenter who said, “I consider Bitcoin…”. And Schlegel added: “a very interesting concept.”
 
Even though this was his only statement regarding Bitcoin, it gives an interesting insight into the current view of the Swiss National Bank. The statement implies that the SNB is curious about the technology and the potential use of Bitcoin. However, it does not mean that it supports or opposes BTC.
 
Still, the statement is notable because a US Federal Reserve (Fed) or European Central Bank (ECB) could never admit that the number one cryptocurrency is an “interesting concept.” Instead, ECB Pre…]]></summary>

Foundry, the Bitcoin mining arm of Digital Currency Group, will stop providing its services for free, according to a notice distributed to clients as reported by Bloomberg. 
The company has been offering its mining pool services free of charge since 2019 which contributed to its significant growth, now holding the largest share of estimated hash rate at more than 30%. 
The notice states that the mining pool fees will be tiered based on the previous quarter’s average hashrate. The change is expected to take effect between April 19 and April 22.
DCG's crypto lending unit, Genesis, filed for bankruptcy as one of the final dominos ensuing from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.
Bitcoin mining companies faced a rocky 2022, with many “fighting for survival,” as Bitcoin Magazine PRO analysts put it. But despite necessary moves like public mining giant Marathon Digital selling bitcoin for the first time in company history, good news has come out of the industry as 2023 takes off, such as the announcement of Terawulf’s nuclear facility operation, the expected 50MW CleanSpark expansion, and more.
This move by Foundry may be a bolstering effort designed to better mitigate the impacts of seasons like that of late 2022.]]></summary>

Buncombe County commissioners are pushing forward with a plan to impose a one-year pause on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining in the North Carolina county, citing concerns about its impact on the environment and the community according to reporting by WLOS ABC13. 
Currently, the county's ordinances do not define cryptocurrency mining as a specific use, prompting officials to consider a temporary halt on the activity while regulations are developed.
A public hearing has been set for May 2 to discuss the proposed moratorium, providing the community with an opportunity to share their views on the issue. 
The surge in mining operations across America has raised concerns amongst critics about the environmental impact of the activity. A Texas Senate committee recently hosted a hearing in regards to legislation that would limit energy agreements used by Bitcoin miners, along with stopping favorable tax legislation. This legislation passed through the Senate committee, bringing it one step closer to reality.
US Bitcoin Corp, a Bitcoin mining company operating in Niagara Falls, also recently reached a tentative agreement with the city to resume operations after the facility was halted by a state supreme court judge’s ruling. 
Along with fines and legal fees, the miner would be forced to comply with noise ordinances and other regulations designed to limit the facility’s impact on its surrounding community.]]></summary>
