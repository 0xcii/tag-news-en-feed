        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with anticipation as Bitcoin (BTC) trades near its all-time high, inching closer to a potential record-breaking run. This bullish sentiment comes on the heels of a significant price surge in March, which saw BTC peak at $73,805. However, analysts believe the best may be yet to come, with the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event just around the corner.
 
 
Bitcoin Halving: A Catalyst for Price Rise?
 
Bitcoin halvings are pivotal events in the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem, occurring approximately every four years. These events are programmed into the cryptocurrency’s protocol and serve to reduce the rate at which new coins are created.
 
The mechanism behind halvings involves cutting the rewards for miners who validate transactions on the Bitcoin network …]]></summary>

Bitcoin Demand From Accumulation Addresses Is Higher Than Miner Issuance
 
As CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno explained in a new post on X, the demand for the asset has recently been growing at an unprecedented rate. Below is the chart shared by the analyst showing the demand from the “permanent holders.”
 

 
 
The “permanent holders” here refer to the owners of the “accumulation addresses,” which are defined as wallets that have only a history of buying BTC and never of selling it.
 
 
Since these investors aren’t known to sell, it’s possible that the new supply that they accumulate would also become similarly illiquid in the future.…]]></summary>

Uncertainty Looms For Ethereum ETFs
 
The report notes that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s emphasis on crypto assets subject to federal securities laws has further complicated matters for an Ethereum ETF. Gensler has asserted that most crypto assets are investment contracts, consistent with the SEC’s perspective.

Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading.

Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase's premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin's all-time high.
