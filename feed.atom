        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite facing a stormy year in 2023, Binance, the renowned crypto trading platform, has managed to maintain its position as the exchange with the largest trading volume.
 
A recent analysis from Bitining, a crypto educational platform, reveals that Binance currently holds a 43.8% share of the global crypto exchange trade volume.
 
 
This figure, while lower than the 62.3% dominance it enjoyed at the start of 2023, still places it significantly ahead of its competitors, who collectively hold 56.2%.
 
 
Binance remains the dominant exchange by volume.
 
Despite a market share drop after the $4.3B settlement with US regulators.
