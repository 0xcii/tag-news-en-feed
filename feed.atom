How Litecoin Saved Dogecoin
 
Belew tweeted that Dogecoin merged mined with Litecoin in 2014, with the blockchain network ultimately implementing an auxiliary-proof-of-work (AuxPoW) consensus mechanism in the process. 
 
 
Merged mining is when a miner can mine multiple cryptocurrencies on different blockchains. A miner can do this without sacrificing performance and maintaining a high-security level. S it is believed that Belew was referring to Dogecoin being able to tap into Litecoin’s security …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin privacy researcher Shinobi is joining Bitcoin Magazine as Technical Editor.
With a long history of contributions to the Bitcoin development conversation, Shinobi will seek to enhance the publication’s ability to elevate ongoing technical discussions at a time when navigating the extensive variety of proposals is more difficult than ever. 
Shinobi has previously received a grant from Bitcoin payments startup Strike, and has served as Technical Advisor to the popular industry podcast What Bitcoin Did. 
“Bitcoin Magazine's decision to bring Shinobi on board as Technical Editor underscores its dedication to providing readers with accurate, timely, and in-depth coverage of the evolving technical landscape of Bitcoin,” said Editor-in-Chief Mark Goodwin. 
Shinobi's work to date has involved exploring privacy solutions such as CoinJoin and other techniques that obfuscate the origin and destination of Bitcoin transactions. Further, his work has shed light on how Bitcoin transactions can be made more private and fungible, crucial qualities for a digital currency aiming to be widely adopted.
“I am very excited and looking forward to the opportunity to help steer the conversation in the community away from memeing and infighting and towards constructive consideration of the many options we have to solve Bitcoin’s engineering challenges,” Shinobi said. 
Overall, Bitcoin Magazine remains committed to maintaining an open platform for discourse on Bitcoin, meaning Shinobi will be tasked with ensuring consistent Editorial standards are applied to all community submissions on a go-forward basis. 
Bitcoin Magazine is open to all contributors interested in joining the Bitcoin discussion, with our editors able to be reached at editors@bitcoinmagzine.]]></summary>

The discourse was ignited by Saul, a prominent figure in the XRP community, who drew an analogy between XRPL and Nokia, suggesting that Xahau might play the role of Apple, potentially overshadowing XRPL in the same way Apple did to Nokia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved lower on Tuesday, as U.S. traders returned from the Labor Day celebration, bringing back bearish sentiment with them. The global crypto market cap was down by 0.47% at the time of writing. Ethereum remained in the red, with price trading below a recent support point.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin fell further below the $26,000 level on Tuesday, as U.S. traders returned to action in today’s session.
 
BTC/USD dived to a bottom at $25,589.99 earlier in the day, following a high of $25,945.42 to start the week.
 
As a result of the decline, bitcoin moved marginally below a support point of $25,600, however bulls have reentered to swiftly reject this breakout.
 
 
At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $25,754.25, which seems to be due to the relative strength index (RSI) finding its own floor.
 
The RSI is currently at a reading of 36.19, which comes after resisting a breakout from a floor of 35.00.
 
A ceiling at 39.00 now awaits would-be bulls, and should they rally beyond this point, BTC will likely be back above $26,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around a floor of its own at $1,630, after rebounding from an earlier breakout.
 
After starting the day at a low of $1,610.14, ETH/USD has been able to rise to a peak of $1,635.29 on Tuesday.
 
Overall, ethereum has mostly hovered around this point since August 17, following a drop in price which sent the cryptocurrency below $1,600.
 
 
This consolidation has led to the 10-day (red) moving average nearing its 25-day (blue) counterpart, increasing the prospect of an upwards cross.
 
Longer-term bulls are likely looking for such a technical occurrence, which could help provide validation for buying the current dip.

Crypto outflows took a breather last week, providing a glimmer of hope for an industry grappling with prolonged negative sentiment. According to recent data, digital-asset investment products saw $11.2 million flow out of the market, marking the eighth consecutive week of outflows. 
 
However, the silver lining in this dark cloud was Bitcoin, which defied the trend and attracted $3.8 million in inflows following Grayscale’s legal victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged a Hawaiian resident for falsely claiming that his fraudulent security would become the “first publicly traded security fund to convert to a cryptocurrency.” According to the Commission, the man promoted the security to boost its price and bolster the value of his portfolio.
 
Fabricated Documents Used to Perpetrate the Fraud
 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged a Hawaiian resident Jeremy Koski for allegedly fabricating and posting fake documents about a purported security that he said would become the “first publicly traded security fund to convert to a cryptocurrency.” The SEC also accused Koski of falsely claiming that the conversion would “allow the fund to recover the face value of $25 as it opens up to a new world of digitized currency.”
 
According to the Commission’s Sept. 1 press release, the SEC has since formally charged Koski with “violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.” The SEC said it is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations.
 
 
Explaining how Koski perpetrated the fraud, the SEC alleged that the Hawaii resident had used internet message boards and different usernames to promote the fake documents. Koski’s objective according to the Commission was to not only boost the price of the security that used the symbol COTRP but bolster the value of his portfolio.
 
To support these allegations, the SEC claimed that after Koski posted a notice in May 2021 stating that the “JCP debentures would be redeemed early at their full value,” the price of the security went up by 75%. According to the SEC, Koski was aware that his statements were false.
