Take action now.”
 
Robert Kiyosaki and Spot Bitcoin ETFs
 
The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has suggested investing in bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for investors who prefer this approach over direct investment in bitcoin.

According to Bloomberg, the exchange is offering its creditors “about 3.35 cents” on the dollar of their initial claims.
 
This offer forms a key part of the company’s restructuring strategy as it grapples with $97 million owed to its customers.
 
 
Restructuring Proposal And Creditors’ Response
 
This restructuring proposal, while offering some relief, falls significantly short of the total amount owed. Zipmex’s move to offer such a percentage of repayment reflects its current financial challenges.
 
The company’s CEO, Marcus Lim, has refrained from confirming the exact details of this restructuring plan but has noted…]]></summary>

When Will LUNC Price Reach $0.0005?
 
The machine learning algorithm at CoinCodex has maintained a rather bullish stance on the price of LUNC going forward but still thinks that the $0.0005 price target is still a long way away. For example, the predictions for both the next five days and then the next month remain the same at the $0.000118 level, with not much changes going forward.
