        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Titanium Blockchain chief executive Michael Stollery has been handed a four-year prison sentence for his involvement in a 2018 initial coin offering scandal that left investors $21 million out of pocket. 
 
Stollery, who founded Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services (TBIS), was a central figure in what the U.S. Department of Justice has called a “cryptocurrency fraud scheme.” 
 
The scheme revolved around an ICO for TBIS that took place between late 2017 and early 2018, and the Titanium Blockchain big boss was instrumental in its orchestration. 
 
The case is just the latest example of the authorities cracking down on fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes and underscores the need for vigilance among investors.

Last week, Bitcoin hit a new yearly high of $28,921 before US Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman Jerome Powell wiped out the rally with his hawkish comments during the FOMC press conference.
 
This week, in addition to some key economic data, the US banking system will again be in focus. The banking sector in the US and also in Europe (after the Credit Suisse bailout) remain under pressure.
 
The Fed reported last week that US banks raised $475 billion in the wake of the banking crisis. In the two weeks since the SVB collapse, over $500 billion has also been withdrawn from small banks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the Montenegro-based newspaper Vijesti, Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terraform Labs, also known as Kwon Do-hyung, is appealing the detention extension ordered by a Montenegrin court. Kwon was arrested on March 23, 2023, after being caught at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro while traveling with fraudulent identification documents.
 
Report Says Kwon’s Legal Representation Aims to Appeal 30-Day Detention Extension
 
Three days ago, Montenegro’s Interior Minister Filip Adzic announced on Twitter that Do Kwon, the co-founder and CEO of Terraform Labs, was arrested on Thursday for presenting forged identity documents. Kwon’s location was unknown for some time, with speculation that he was hiding in Singapore or possibly Dubai.
 
The Montenegrin police stated that Kwon’s fraudulent documents originated from Costa Rica and Belgium. According to the Montenegrin newspaper Vijesti and local media, Kwon’s legal team is seeking to appeal his 30-day detention extension. Kwon is facing several legal challenges abroad, including an investigation in South Korea and multiple lawsuits in the United States.
 
The report notes that detention for Kwon’s offense is typically limited to 72 hours, but the court granted the extension due to Kwon’s status as a flight risk. Montenegrin prosecutors have stated that Kwon and his companion’s identities have not been completely verified and that foreign prosecutors, such as those from South Korea, are seeking Kwon’s extradition. Two days ago, a South Korean spokesperson announced that their prosecutors are taking measures to “repatriate Kwon Do-hyung.” Kwon’s legal team and Vijesti reporters say that the appeal will be filed this week.
 
What do you think will be the outcome of Do Kwon’s legal battles in Montenegro, South Korea, and the United States? Share your thoughts about this subject in the comments section below.]]></summary>
