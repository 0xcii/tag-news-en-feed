Many predicted and feared what now seems to be materializing. The recent bankruptcy filings and turmoil in the industry triggered this response. 
 
 
In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, Gary Gensler, Chairman of the Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC), denied an ongoing attempt to crack down on crypto. The Commission settled a $30 million deal with crypto exchange Kraken yesterday.
 
The company has ended its offering of stake service as the SEC considered this product an “illegal” sale of a security. This settlement is just one of the many events hinting at stricter regulations for the nascent industry in the United States.

Bitcoin changes our mental model and we can see it in a lot of people that get into Bitcoin. Many Bitcoiners start saving and not living paycheck to paycheck. Many start taking their lives more seriously and quit drinking alcohol and playing video games. Still others start investigating their diet and quit eating sugar, carbs, seed oils and other things they've been eating their whole lives. Some even get married and start having children. There are even some who start taking religion seriously.
These results are pretty puzzling. What does a digital money have to do with any of these things? Yet, to even ask this question is to ignore the environmen…]]></summary>

However, these are far from your ‘run of the mill’ NFTs – and the lack of Bitcoin’s smart contracts will likely be a stark reminder and how valuable Ethereum and other smart contract interfaced chains really are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana slipped to a three-week low on Feb.10, as momentum in cryptocurrency markets remained firmly bearish. At the time of writing this, the global market cap is trading 4.23% lower, with bears recapturing sentiment. Cardano was also on the decline, falling by as much as 8% today.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) prices plunged during today’s session, which comes as bears have seemingly recaptured market sentiment.
 
Following a high of $22.90 on Thursday, SOL/USD moved to an intraday low at $20.20 earlier in the session.
 
This drop resulted in the token hitting its lowest point since January 19, when solana last collided with a floor at $20.00.
 
 
Since hitting a peak of 87.67 on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) back on January 13, price strength has consistently declined.
 
As a result of this, the index is now tracking at 44.21, which is its weakest point since January 2 when SOL was under $10.00.
 
Ultimately, this has its positives, as longer-term bulls may see this as a sign that prices are gradually moving in the right direction.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) extended its own recent sell-off on Friday, with prices falling for a third straight session.
 
ADA/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.3558 earlier today, which comes after prices peaked at $0.3896 on Thursday.
 
As a result of this drop, ADA slipped to its weakest point since January 25, breaking out of a floor at $0.3590 in the process.
 
 
Since falling from this point of support, ADA has somewhat rallied, with bulls moving to buy the dip in price.
 
This took place as the RSI leveled out at a floor of 46.70, with cardano currently at $0.3611.
 
If this floor on the indicator continues to hold firm, there could be a rally over the week, with bulls re-entering the market.

Bitcoin SOPR Again Nears The Bull-Bear Junction Retest
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the SOPR is approaching a value of 1. The “SOPR” is an indicator that tells us whether the average investor in the Bitcoin market is selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the overall market is moving coins at some profit right now. On the other hand, values below the threshold imply the holders as a whole are realizing some loss at the moment.
 
Naturally, when the SOPR has values exactly equal to 1, it means the profit being realized in the market is e…]]></summary>

Before now, the China government placed some restrictions on cryptocurrencies. The idea was to keep its citizen safe from possible scams and risks in the crypto space. It also warned the citizens to avoid transactions with crypto, stating that they are illegal. But it appears that the narratives are about to change in Hong Kong.
