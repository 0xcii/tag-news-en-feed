        <updated>2024-03-11T17:00:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided a bullish narrative for the Shiba Inu price action, increasing the possibility of the meme coin inching closer to its all-time high (ATH). This is coming at a time when the crypto token’s fundamentals look to be stronger than ever. 
 
SHIB Could See A 40% Bullish Breakout
 
Martinez highlighted in an X (formerly Twitter) post a symmetrical triangle that formed on the SHIB chart. He stated that a sustained close above the $0.000038 resistance “could trigger a 40% bullish breakout, pushing SHIB toward $0.000052.” Meanwhile, he added that the meme coin losing the $0.000033 support level will invalidate the bullish outlook.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump spoke to CNBC about his stance on Bitcoin today, revealing that he occasionally accepts Bitcoin as payment. In the interview, Trump acknowledged the growing popularity of Bitcoin and that "its taken its own life." While Trump did not provide specific details about the frequency or context in which he accepts Bitcoin, his statement underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of BTC.

JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Donald Trump tells CNBC he "sometimes will let people pay through #Bitcoin" pic.twitter.com/dhbgB2Xep6
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 11, 2024
  
  
  
"I sometimes will let people pay through Bitcoin," the former President Trump stated. "If you think of it, its an additional form of currency.  And I used to say I want one currency, I want the dollar, I don't want people leaving the dollar. And I feel that way but I will tell you it has taken on a life."
Trump's acknowledgment of Bitcoin as a payment option comes at a time when more businesses and individuals are embracing Bitcoin as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Despite his past skepticism about Bitcoin, Trump's recent comments suggest a potential shift in his perspective.
The statement from Trump adds to the ongoing discussion about the role of Bitcoin in the traditional financial system. As one of the most prominent political figures globally, Trump's remarks may influence public perception and further fuel the adoption of Bitcoin.
Overall, Trump's acknowledgment of accepting Bitcoin payments highlights the evolving landscape of this new asset class and the integration of BTC into mainstream financial practices.]]></summary>

By lowering the number of SHIB tokens in circulation, the Shiba Inu burn initiative seeks to decrease the overall supply of the token. Consequently, this makes the digital asset more valuable and possibly raises the price of SHIB.
 
Shiba Inu Burn Initiative Sees Uptick Of Over 300%
 
According to the burn tracker Shibburn, the last 24 hours have seen a significant spike in the Shiba Inu burn rate. Data from Shibburn reveals that the burn initiative recorded a 335.94% increase, fueling optimism among the SHIB community and crypto enthusiasts.
