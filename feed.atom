Hackers Target 50 Cent’s Account To Promote Fake Crypto
 
50 Cent revealed in an Instagram post that his X account was hacked while denying any ties to the GUNIT meme coin, which was promoted on his X account. He added that the hacker made $300 million from this elaborate scam. However, that looks unlikely, considering the meme coin’s liquidity and market cap before it was quickly discovered as a scam.
