Dogecoin Ready For Long-Term Bullish Rally
 
Crypto analyst Behdark, on the TradingView website, shared an interesting analysis that has caught the eye of Dogecoin community members. The crypto analyst identified that the meme coin has now entered a bullish rally, with reasons to back up why this is so.
 
 
Behdark explained that the Dogecoin price has formed strong support just above $0.1, and this has helped to bounce the coin back up in the event of a crash. The demand at this level is what ensures tha…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Have Been On The Decline Recently
 
As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the BTC exchange inflows have been heading down for a while now. The “exchange inflow” is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin the investors deposit to wallets attached to centralized exchanges.
 
 
When this metric’s value is high, it means that holders are transferring a large number of coins to these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons why investors might deposit coins in the exchanges’ custody is for selling purposes, this kind of trend can be bearish for the asset.

Hoskinson conducted a “hypothetical poll” on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, asking his followers if they would like to see Bitcoin Cash become a Cardano “partnerchain.” He noted that this partnership would upgrade Bitcoin Cash with “Useful Proof of Work Leios, NiPoPoWs, and Ergo tech.”
