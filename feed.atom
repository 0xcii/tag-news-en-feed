institutions in the US will start using its cryptocurrency XRP following the  
court ruling in the case between the blockchain company and the Securities and  
Exchange Commission (SEC).
Last week, a judge in  
New York ruled that Ripple did not violate federal securities laws by selling

Enabled by advances in fast recursive zero knowledge proofs, QED is able to achieve this scale without compromising security or decentralization and proves all transactions end-to-end using proof recursion (verifying a zero knowledge proof in a zero knowledge proof ).

In a blog post published on Monday, July 17, the exchange announced that deposits and withdrawals for Bitcoin (BTC) are now open on the Lightning Network.
 
This integration marks a significant milestone for the industry as it opens up new avenues for faster, more efficient, and scalable Bitcoin transactions. Back in May 2023, Binance hinted at an imminent integration. The exchange temporarily halted Bitcoin withdrawals due to an unprecedented surge in volume triggered by increased interest in Ordinals. After successfully resolving the issue, Binance said it was “working hard” to enable BTC Lightning Network withdrawals.
