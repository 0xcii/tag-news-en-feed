        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-70-higher-as-markets-react-to-court-ruling/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-14T15:38:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP soared by as much as 70% higher on Friday, as markets continued to react to a court ruling that the token is not a security. On Thursday, U.S. judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not “necessarily a security on its face.” Solana also surged on the news, climbing by nearly 30%. 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was undoubtedly one of the biggest movers in the market on Friday, surging by nearly 70%.
 
Following a low of $0.4728 on Thursday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.8875 during today’s session.
 
Traders continued to long for the token as exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken moved to relist XRP on their platform.
 
 
Overall, this rally has pushed XRP to its strongest point since Christmas day of 2021, when price peaked at $0.9975.
 
From the chart, the move began after the relative strength index (RSI) moved past a ceiling at 75.00.
 
The index went on to reach a high of 88.00, however as traders have begun to secure gains, price strength is now at 80.59.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
In addition to XRP, solana (SOL) also soared higher in today’s session, rising by nearly 30% in the process.
 
SOL/USD moved to a peak of $30.06 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after the price was at a low of $22.23.
 
As a result of this, solana hit its highest level since last November, following a breakout of a ceiling at $26.00.
 
 
The token is now trading at $27.78, which appears to be a result of profit takers closing previous positions.
 
Additionally, the RSI is deep in overbought territory, which will likely tempt further short selling in the coming days.

The Number Of Bitcoin Whales On The Network Has Dropped Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, while the whales have been selling, the smaller entities have been accumulating. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which measures the total amount of addresses that belong to each wallet group on the network.
 
The addresses are divided into these wallet groups based on the total number of coins that they are holding right now. The 10-100 coins group, for example, includes all addresses carrying a balance of at least 10 BTC and at most 100 BTC.

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was on the cusp of hitting $32,000 in the past 24 hours, following the news that XRP was not necessarily classified as a security by a U.S. judge.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $31,814.51 late on Thursday, after trading at a low of $30,486.69 earlier in the day.
 
Yesterday’s peak is the strongest point bitcoin has hit since late-May last year, which is the last time price was over $32,000.

Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have emerged as a key breakthrough in the financial  
environment, having the potential to transform our perception of and

They have the  
ability to reform payments, increase financial inclusion, and change monetary

Though the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission(SEC) stated that these initial filings were inadequate, forcing the firms to refile, many investors believe that they will eventually be approved, creating the first-such products on the market. These new financial instruments would allow institutional and retail investors to access exposure to bitcoin's price without having to purchase actual bitcoin.
