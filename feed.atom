        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitfarms-expands-mining-operations-with-new-100-mw-facility-in-paraguay-aiming-for-21-eh-s-capacity-by-year-end/"/>
        <updated>2024-01-24T22:04:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, Bitfarms, a bitcoin mining enterprise listed on the U.S. stock market, revealed the successful acquisition of a new site in Yguazu, Paraguay, earmarked for a 100 megawatt (MW) mining facility. This development is part of Bitfarms’ ambitious plan to escalate its capacity to 21 exahash per second (EH/s) by year’s end.
 
Bitfarms Targets 21 EH/S Capacity With New Paraguay Facility
 
The announcement by Bitfarms (Nasdaq: BITF) about securing land in Yguazu, Paraguay, aligns with the current trend of significant expansion observed in the mining sector. This period has seen numerous mining corporations extend their operations and procure an extensive array of tens of thousands of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining rigs.
 
 
“The newly acquired land is located in the heart of Paraguay near the Itaipú Dam, the third largest hydropower dam in the world with 14 gigawatts of installed capacity,” Geoff Morphy the president and CEO of Bitfarms remarked on Wednesday. “Positioned to benefit from the region’s abundant renewable energy resources, this new facility should be sustainable both economically and environmentally.”
 
Morphy added:
 

Once Yguazu comes online, over 85% of our portfolio will be powered by low-cost green energy that promotes environmentally sustainable bitcoin mining.
 
 
Bitfarms anticipates completing the construction phase by the latter part of 2024. This growth is a key component of Bitfarms’ strategy to boost its corporate hashrate to 21 EH/s by the close of 2024, leveraging a purchase option agreement with Bitmain for additional T21 mining rigs. On Wednesday, BITF shares witnessed a 5% increase in value against the U.S. dollar, yet the stock has experienced an 8% decline over the week. Additionally, 30-day data reveals a loss exceeding 25% in BITF shares’ value this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin maximalist and crypto analyst Max Keiser recently offered his opinion on what price XRP will trade at against Bitcoin in the future. His latest remarks come just days after he initially labeled the XRP token a “centralized garbage.”
 
Why XRP Is “Guaranteed” To Go To Zero Against Bitcoin
 
Once again, referring to XRP as a “centralized garbage,” Keiser mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the crypto token is “mathematically guaranteed to trade at zero against Bitcoin. The analyst seemed to suggest that XRP, unlike Bitcoin, didn’t have strong fundamentals and was going to become worthless soon enough. 
 
 
Meanwhile, he referred to Bitcoin as “perfect money,” which was “perfectly decentralized” and “sent by God” to save the financial system. Keiser, in a previous post, had…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitwise, a leading cryptocurrency asset management firm, has set a new precedent by becoming the first U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to publicly disclose its Bitcoin address holdings.



"Now anyone can verify BITB's holdings and flows directly on the blockchain," the asset manager stated. "Onchain transparency is core to Bitcoin's ethos. We're proud to walk the walk with BITB."
In a move that aligns with the growing demand for openness and accountability in the industry, Bitwise is providing investors and the public with real-time access to the Bitcoin addresses associated with its ETF holdings. This disclosure enhances transparency and and attempts to fosters trust, addressing concerns related to the verification of asset backing and allocation within the ETF.
"Publishing on-chain addresses is a first step toward increasing public transparency," Bitwise continued. "As infrastructure evolves, we hope to do more, such as working with firms like hoseki app to provide real-time cryptographic attestations."
The decision to publish BTC address holdings helps positions Bitwise at the forefront of regulatory compliance and investor communication. By voluntarily sharing this information, Bitwise demonstrates a commitment to setting an industry standard and building credibility for Bitcoin investment products.
Earlier this month, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially approved the listing of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since launch, the ETFs have seen billions of dollars in demand and have become the second largest ETF commodity in the country.]]></summary>
