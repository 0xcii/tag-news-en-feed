Bitcoin Miner Supply May Hold Key To Start Of Next Bull Rally
 
In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed the trend in the “Supply held by Miners” metric. As its name suggests, this indicator measures the total amount of supply currently sitting in the wallets connected to the Bitcoin miners.
 
When the value of this metric rises, the miners receive a net number of tokens in their wallets. Miners naturally constantly receive coins into their addresses as they solve blocks and receive rewards, so inflows for them aren’t anything special.
 
 
Net inflows, however, can be something to note when they occur on large scales and last for some signi…]]></summary>
