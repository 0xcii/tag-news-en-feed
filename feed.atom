While thinking about what it would take for Bitcoin to receive a massive adoption push in the United States, I was able to think of one such scenario that may not be very far off.
And contrary to what you think, it doesn’t have anything to do with regulation, taxation, accounting standards, or any of the things that are mistakenly talked about as the ebb and flow of Bitcoin adoption on a daily basis.

Specifically, the timing of the transaction and the memo contained in it have caused these community members to ask questions about what could be happening.
 
400 Million XRP Unlocked From Ripple’s Escrow
 
The on-chain analytics platform Whale Alert brought the transaction to the community’s attention when it reported that 400 million XRP had been unlocked from the escrow account. While it is not unusual for the crypto firm to carry out such transactions, the timing is surprising since Ripple unlocks these tokens at the beginning of every month.
