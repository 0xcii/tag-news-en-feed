        <updated>2023-04-11T12:29:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved above $30,000 on April 11, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. Markets surged after data in China showed that consumer prices had hit an 18-month low. Ethereum was also higher on the news, moving closer to $2,000. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) raced above $30,000 for the first time in ten months, as markets reacted to the latest inflation data from China.
 
Consumer prices in China rose by 0.7% in March, which is the slowest increase since September 2021.
 
Following a low of $28,189.27 to start the week, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $30,160.48 earlier today.
 
 
This move saw bitcoin climb to its strongest point since June 9, and comes as the 10-day (red) moving average avoided a downward cross with its 24-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) moved above a key resistance point of 68.00, and is currently tracking at 71.05.
 
The next visible ceiling appears to be at the 73.00 mark, and as a result, bulls may begin to secure profits, slowly vacating earlier positions.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also back in the green on Tuesday, with prices once again trading above $1,900.
 
ETH/USD hit a peak of $1,936.73 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,848.16.
 
As a result of Tuesday’s surge in price, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency neared its highest point since last August.
 
Looking at the chart, today’s move coincided with the RSI breaking out of a ceiling at the 61.00 mark.
 
 
At the time of writing, price strength is at a reading of 64.04, with an upcoming resistance point at 65.00.
 
Should ETH move beyond this point, there is a good chance that ETH will move back above $2,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) may have had a week of consolidation, but it’s far from being overlooked by traders. With a steady rise in futures open interest since mid-March, this cryptocurrency has been on the radar of many investors. 
 
And while its recent performance hasn’t been particularly outstanding, with a 1.7% increase in the past 24 hours and a 1.2% decrease in the last seven days, the current price of Shiba Inu at $0.00001113, according to Coingecko, still has the potential to attract attention.
 

 
 
But what is driving the rising futures open interest on SHIB, and what does this mean for the future of this cryptocurrency?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. The Seasonal Tokens economy has gone through its second change of season. Like bitcoin, the four tokens – Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter – go through regular halvings of the supply from mining. Every nine months, the rate of production of one of the tokens is cut in half. On the 6th of March, the Summer halving took place. Summer went from being produced at the fastest rate of the four tokens, to the slowest.
 
As the market adjusts to the lower rate of supply after a halving, the token that was previously the cheapest gradually becomes the most expensive. This happened with Spring after its halving in June of last year. The same process is now unfolding with Summer. Autumn tokens, which are now produced at the fastest rate of the four, have become the cheapest token, and…]]></summary>

And according to an analysis by attorney Jeremy Hogan, who has been following the case with video updates since the beginning, the odds of a Ripple victory are good if Judge Torres understands the technology.
 
As the attorney notes, however, a Ripple victory is by no means a no-brainer, especially since the case represents the entire crypto industry’s biggest battle against the SEC. “This is a nuanced legal battle on which the future of “crypto” as we know it may hinge,” Hogan states.

Bank walks, so called by analysts due to their slow action when compared to bank runs, are slow movements of deposits caused by the constant search for higher yields. According to an ongoing study titled “Destabilizing Digital Bank Walks,” they “cannot be stopped by any deposit insurance and that will undermine the stability of the banking system in the months to come.”
