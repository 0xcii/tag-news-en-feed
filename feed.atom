Data sourced by Finbold from CompaniesMarketCap reveals a staggering accumulation of over $4.47 billion in losses among the 16 publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies over the past 12 consecutive months. This trend has cast a shadow over the industry, prompting introspection into its sustainability.
 
Compounding the woes of the Bitcoin mining industry is the cryptocurrency’s own struggles. Bitcoin’s value has been persistently lingering below the $26,000 mark, generating concerns across the market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin returned to the red on Tuesday, as markets began to anticipate the upcoming consumer confidence report in the United States. The Conference Board index is expected to fall to a reading of 116 in August, from 117 the month prior. Ethereum was also marginally lower.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin slipped slightly during Tuesday’s session, as markets began to anticipate the upcoming consumer confidence report from the United States.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,914.93 earlier in today’s session, following a peak of $26,406.15 on Monday.
 
The decline sees bitcoin remain in consolidation, however some traders are optimistic about this ending as the week progresses.
 
 
Looking at the chart, one of the reasons for this long stretch of price uncertainty is the relative strength index (RSI) failing to surge past resistance.
 
In this case, the aforementioned ceiling is at the 33.00 mark, which has remained intact for nearly two weeks.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 30.72.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) edged marginally lower on Tuesday, as it continued to trade close to a support point of its own.
 
Following a high of $1,665.14 to start the week, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,641.63 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw ethereum once again fall below a support point of $1,650, which it has hovered around for the last ten days.
 
 
As of writing, the index remains in oversold territory, with a reading of 30.92, and appears to be heading for a floor at 29.00.
 
Should it reach this point there is a strong chance that ethereum will move under $1,630.

As a Swiss citizen, it didn’t take me long to understand why Bitcoin is unique. Switzerland is a country that values lots of the critical aspects that Bitcoin offers to people. The small country in the middle of Europe encourages self sovereignty, privacy and financial literacy. The pioneering Swiss banking secrecy was codified in 1934. This regulation, along with its political neutrality and enduring stability, makes the country a “safe haven” for companies and institutions that deal with money.
However, there is one critical flaw: What’s the point of using the most trustworthy place in the world to store your money when t…]]></summary>

For one, they believe the regulator is trying to smear the token’s reputation with this argument.
 
Is SEC Trying to Malign XRP?
 
Pro-XRP legal expert Bill Morgan has tagged this view by the SEC as “negative and reactionary.” He believes that the SEC either doesn’t understand XRP or deliberately wants to hinder Ripple’s progress as a decentralized payment system.
 
 
The SEC first claimed that XRP has no intrinsic value in its memorandum of law in opposition to Ripple’s motion for summary judgment. Furthermore, the regulator argued that XRP had no intrinsic value in opposition to Ripple’s two arguments in…]]></summary>

DeOrderBook, a groundbreaking decentralized finance (DeFi) optionality protocol, is gearing up for its Ethereum mainnet launch, ushering in a new era for DeFi users who seek unprecedented capital flexibility, advanced hedging mechanisms, and sustainable real yield.
 
At launch, the protocol supports $WBTC and $USDC although the team is actively working on support for further coins and chains.
 
What makes DeOrderBook especially interesting?
 
DeOrderBook’s unique design represents a significant departure from traditional DeFi protocols by providing an automated way to monetise an optionality position — think about it as a Uniswap for optionality.
