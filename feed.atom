In the wake of one of the worst and most bemusing digital currency-related company implosions to date, Mastercard’s Grace Berkery is convinced that something good came out of the market-crippling event.
 
The startup engagement director for the payment processing firm believes the series of events involving FTX provides an opportunity for the industry and its participants to take a break and reset in order to better assess their next steps moving forward.
 
Moreover, Berkery is also adamant that this “setback” brought about by the FTX crash won’t be enough to dissuade institut…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was back in the green on Friday, with prices once again moving above the $17,000 level. Cryptocurrencies were mostly higher in today’s session, as prices rebounded from recent losses. Ethereum also surged earlier in the day, climbing closer to the $1,300 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) climbed higher in today’s session, with the coin surging back above the $17,000 level.
 
Following a low of $16,788.78 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $17,274.60 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw bitcoin rally beyond its resistance level at $17,200, hitting a five-day high in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, BTC has since retreated from earlier highs, as bullish momentum faded soon after the breakout.
 
As of writing, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 50.93, which is marginally below a ceiling at 52.00.
 
Should the index continue to move higher, then the next target for bulls will likely be the $17,600 point.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also edged higher in today’s session, with prices rebounding from recent losses.
 
ETH/USD moved to a peak of $1,286.23 on Friday, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,227.50 during Thursday’s session.
 
As a result of today’s move, the coin neared a key resistance level of $1,305, rising to its highest point since Monday in the process.
 
 
Currently, it appears as though ethereum bulls are targeting a move beyond the $1,300 mark, however a ceiling on the RSI seems to be in the way.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 52.00, which has also been a key point of resistance in the past.
 
Bulls would need to overcome this hurdle first, in order to send prices towards the targeted $1,300 level.

This is an opinion editorial by Jonathan Leger, a software developer and author of the Regarding Bitcoin newsletter. A version of this article was originally published on Substack.
I was raised in a doomsday cult that taught that God was getting ready to wage the war of Armageddon and bring about the end of the current world order. The governments, all ruled by the devil, would be replaced with the Kingdom of Heaven ruled by Jesus Christ. The cult discouraged any kind of real financial planning because of this worldview. After all, what was the point of investing in a system facing imminent destruction?
