7-Day Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Set A New Record
 
The “mining hashrate” refers to the total amount of computing power currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. This metric is very relevant for the BTC network, as its value can have a direct influence on the chain’s security.
 
A larger hashrate means that there are more nodes for a malicious attacker to go through, as such an attack can only be successful if the attacker can bring under control at least 51% of the hashrate.
 
 
This benefit on the security from a higher value of the indicator only appears, though, if the new hashrate that’s being added by the miners is sufficiently dece…]]></summary>

The introduction of BRC20 tokens, an innovative token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain, marked 2023 as a year of substantial growth in value for these assets. BRC20s leverage the Ordinals protocol to facilitate the creation and exchange of fungible tokens, akin to Ethereum’s ERC20, yet functioning under the unique conditions of Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) secured architecture.

Mt. Gox Creditors Get Paid
 
Reports first surfaced on the r/mtgoxinsolvency subreddit, with users posting screenshots of PayPal transactions containing repayment funds. Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee overseeing Mt.

By the start of January 2023, this amount declined to $38.30 billion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SOL co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently highlighted the relationship between Solana and Ethereum as he said “Solana is Ethereum.” This assertion came in a post that also shed more light on the future of blockchain interoperability and Solana’s role in all of it. 
 
Why “Solana Is Ethereum”
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Yakovenko elaborated on his “Solana is Ethereum” comment as he stated that THE NETWORK is also a layer-2 network for Ethereum through the “wormhole eigenlayer.” With this, Yakovenko raised the prospect of Solana and Ethereum being interoperable despite operating different protocols and consensus mechanisms. 
 
 
 
 
The co-founder went on to further state that this will become more feasible as soon as “danksharding is scaled up” as SOL blocks could be s…]]></summary>

In addition to the trial for Roman Sterlingov set to begin on February 12th, which questions the reliability of Chainalysis Reactor in a multi-million dollar money laundering allegation, Chainalysis is now getting sued by the crypto project YieldNodes. 
In their 2023 Crypto Crime Report, Chainalysis alleged that YieldNodes, a Hong Kong based project which rents out computing power to participate in a masternode pool, is a scam. In their crypto scam activity summarized graph, Chainalysis depicted YieldNodes as the second largest crypto scam in revenue of 2022 with a total of $341.6M. Notably, Chainalysis’ graph fails to have caught FTX, one of the largest crypto scams to date having misappropriated $8 Billion of customer funds.

Proponents of cryptocurrencies paint a vibrant picture of a decentralized utopia, free from the shackles of traditional finance. They tout the potential for financial inclusion, borderless transactions, and secure digital identities.
 
However, the RBI views such promises with a degree of skepticism. In their eyes, crypto’s inherent volatility and lack of regulatory oversight pose a clear and present danger to India’s financial stability…]]></summary>

The drainer uses Google search and X ads phishing links as a distribution vector and has affected over 63,000 victims as of December 21.
MS Drainer Allows Criminals to Siphon Over $58 Million
A recent report from Scam Sniffer, an anti-scam platform used by several Web3 wallets, has revealed that a certain malware type has managed to siphon over $58 million from cryptocurrency holders. The tool, called MS Wallet Drainer, attacks the cryptocurrency wallets (Ethereum, BNB, and other EVM chains and rollups) of victims using Google and X ads to infect their devices and drain them of any available funds and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
The malware is distributed using the search results of Google searches for popular cryptocurrency sites and decentralized finance exchanges, such as Zapper, Lido, Stargate, Defillama, Orbiter Finance, and Radiant. The same malware was also detected in a series of Ordinals-related X ads, and a recent sampling of X ads on some feeds resulted in more than 60% of the ads leading to sites using the MS Drainer.
The report highlights that these ads use several techniques to obfuscate their purposes and pass advertising audits. For example, they only target certain regions and use redirection to bypass revisions.
One of the victims lost over $24 million in an Ethereum wallet, while another lost over $1 million in Ethereum assets. An investigation revealed that the tool is available in darknet forums with a price of $1,500 for a standard functionality set. While other similar malware tools are fully managed and charge a 20% fee, this one only charges for modules that add additional functionality to the standard package.
