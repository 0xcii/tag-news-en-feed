        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below $28,000 to start the week, as markets continued to react to last Friday’s United States nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report. The payrolls report came in at 250,000 versus expectations of 180,000 jobs. Ethereum was also lower, as prices fell back below $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved lower to start the week, as cryptocurrency markets continued to react to the latest nonfarm payrolls report.
 
The number of jobs added to the U.S. economy came in higher than expected, in many’s eyes justifying the Federal Reserve’s decision to hike interest rates by 0.25%.
 
As a result, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $27,691.26 earlier in today’s session, following a peak of $29,119.38 the day prior.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, BTC has now fallen for a third straight session, with this latest drop sending prices to a one-week low.
 
One of the catalysts for the decline was a breakout which took place on the relative strength index (RSI), which fell below a floor at 47.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.32, with a floor of 42.00 a potential target for bears.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also in the red on Monday, with prices plunging below $1,900.
 
Following a high of $1,934.00 on Sunday, ETH/USD dropped by almost $100, hitting a low of $1,839.89 earlier in the day.
 
Similar to bitcoin, today’s decline saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency fall for its third consecutive day.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that ethereum bears are now attempting to take the RSI to its own point of support at 45.00.
 
Currently, the index is at the 47.02 level, having recently moved below a higher support point at 49.00.
 
Should price strength hit the target of 45.00, there is a possibility that ETH will be trading under $1,800.

Investors Await CPI Data Release
 
The latest iteration of the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) is scheduled to be released later this week and crypto investors seem to be waiting for this before taking any action. The release will happen on May 10, 2023, and will show if inflation in the country increased, decreased, or stayed the same, which can have a great impact on financial markets.
 
 
If inflation were to come in higher, the Fed could retake a hawkish stance which would be brutal for risk assets such as Bitcoin. However, if…]]></summary>

Per a press release shared with Bitcoinist, the team behind World Coin launched a new crypto wallet called World App, a financial and identity manager. Previously in a testing phase running on Polygon, the crypto wallet is now open to the public and free to download.
 
ChatGPT, Not The Only Tool That Will Change The World?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spanish law enforcement recently nabbed three individuals who befriended and eventually kidnapped a Syrian cryptocurrency dealer. Following their arrest, the kidnappers, who were demanding a ransom of over $1.1 million, were found in possession of weapons and fake identity documents. 
 
Syrian Crypto Dealer’s Captors Were His Party Friends
 
Spanish law enforcement recently freed a Syrian cryptocurrency dealer from three kidnappers that were demanding a ransom of $1.12 million (or €1 million). According to a report by a Spanish-language publication, the captured trio was set to appear in court on May 6 where they were expected to face kidnapping as well as illegal possession of weapons charges.
 
As revealed in the report, the unnamed Syrian crypto dealer had partied with the trio before the kidnapping. However, when they four met on May 3, the Hungary-based crypto dealer’s party friends pounced and started demanding the ransom money. According to the report, the crypto dealer whose company is based in Dubai, was told to access applications that he uses to manage his crypto business and to contact the intended recipient of the ransom money.
 
 
However, whilst in captivity, the Syrian crypto dealer is said to have taken a picture through the window and sent this over to a colleague who was negotiating his release. The colleague, in turn, then sent this to the victim’s other acquaintance who then forwarded this to law enforcement.
 
Upon receiving the information, Spanish law enforcement launched an investigation which eventually led to the raid on a luxury villa located in Benalmádena. In addition to finding weapons and gardening tools, law enforcement agents also found one of the kidnappers in possession of several fake identity documents. In addition, two of the Syrian crypto dealer’s captors had fake Greek Passports.

For a long time, the end of April was considered the most likely date when the judge of the US District Court of the Southern District of New York, Analisa Torres, will issue a ruling.
 
Several lawyers from the XRP community favored that date because it would have fit Torres’ previous rulings in other cases. In addition, the judge needed 52 days to rule on the Daubert motions. If she had again taken 52 days to issue the summary judgment, she would have had to publish the ruling on April 27.

Bolivia Passes Law to Sell Gold for Dollars
Bolivia recently passed a law that will allow the government to sell up to 50% of its gold reserves in dollars, easing the internal scarcity of dollars. The law gives faculties to the government to negotiate the sale of 22 tons of gold out of the almost 44 available in the local reserves.

"There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>

And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>
