The decision concerns the firm’s previous work for the now-bankrupt FTX exchange. The monitorships were part of the $4.3 billion deal in which Binance pleaded guilty to violating US money-laundering regulations and trade sanctions. 
 
This development has prompted the DOJ to explore alternative options for the monitorship, while the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) intends to continue engaging with the law firm.

When Alexander “Akin” Fernandez first conceptualized Azteco over a decade ago, he simply wanted to make bitcoin easier to obtain. He wanted people to be able to purchase bitcoin as seamlessly as they were able to buy a gift card, and so he developed a system in which people can purchase prepaid bitcoin vouchers for as little as $10, redeemable in a minute.
Azteco vouchers are now available in over 190 countries, purchasable online or with cash with in-person vendors. The main advantage to buying BTC via Azteco vouchers is the fact that you d…]]></summary>
