Bitcoin Transaction Fees Has Observed A Sharp Increase Recently
 
As explained by analyst James V. Straten in a post on X, the Bitcoin fees have been greater than Ethereum’s recently. The “fee” here naturally refers to the transaction fee that the users on the network have to attach with their transfers as a payment for the chain validators (miners for BTC, stakers for ETH).
 
The total fees earned by the validators in a single day depend on the blockchain conditions on that day. Whenever the network is congested (that is, a large amount of users are making transfers at once), the fees can spike up.
 
 
This is because the blockchain only has a …]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-12-18T15:39:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitwise, the aspiring applicant for a spot Bitcoin ETF, has unveiled a captivating commercial aimed at advocating for it's upcoming Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
"A word to the wise, from a man of few words. #bitcoinisinteresting", Bitwise said.



The commercial, appears to be targeted towards the older generations like gen X and baby boomers, with a classy and sophisticated style that those generations are used to watching on the television in between their favorite shows and sports. "You know what's interesting these days? Bitcoin," said the actor in the commercial. "Look for Bitwise, my friends."
This release arrives at a interesting moment as the SEC continues to evaluate numerous applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitwise, along with several other financial firms, has persistently pursued the establishment of a spot Bitcoin ETF, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning Bitcoin market.
While the commercial aims to familiarize a wider audience with the concept of a spot Bitcoin ETF, it is also helping garner support for their application, potentially influencing public opinion and regulatory decisions regarding Bitcoin investment vehicles.
Bitwise remains hopeful that this latest promotional effort will contribute positively to the ongoing discourse surrounding the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, potentially marking a significant milestone in the adoption of Bitcoin within traditional investment portfolios.]]></summary>

While many people may feel like they are too late (why didn’t I buy it under $100?), like they missed the opportunity, it has likely never been a better time to jump in. More specifically, the ratio of potential rewards compared to the risks behind Bitcoin has never been more attractive. Demand, supply, awareness, narrative, fundamentals; all stars seem to align to give us a memorable year 2024. In particular, here are the top 21 reasons why Bitcoin’s 2024 outlook is exceptionally bullish.

Ethereum
 
The 4-hour chart analysis for ethereum (ETH) paints a predominantly bearish picture, characterized by a distinct downtrend. This trend is evident through the formation of lower highs and lower lows, a classic indicator of bearish momentum. Despite a recent uptrend at a potential short-term reversal, the overarching downward trend suggests this could be a mere temporary pause.

The project which was titled BELLS was Markus’s brainchild before the idea for Dogecoin was born. However, he had abandoned the project and had not said anything about it until now.
 
The Resurrection Of BELLS Blockchain
 
Adam McBride took to X (formerly Twitter) last week to share a recent find that was connected to one of the Dogecoin founders, Bill Markus. According to McBride, the BELLS token was founded by Markus in 2013 but was abandoned. Following the 10th anniversary of DOGE when Markus talked about the beginning of Dogecoin, the crypto enthusiast had gone hunting for Markus’s other crypto project and they found it.

Bitcoin
 
On the 4-hour chart, bitcoin’s (BTC) trajectory shows a downtrend, marked by consistent lower highs and lower lows. A significant drop is notable, where the price plummeted from approximately $43,440 to $40,513. This pattern is underpinned by increased selling pressure, as evidenced by significant volume during downward movements.
