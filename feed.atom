This trend continued as Bitcoin surpassed the $25k mark for the first time since August 2022 this week, and some experts had predicted that the $30k could be the next resistance point. However, this was not the case, and Bitcoin was quickly rejected at $25k. 
 
Bitcoin Price Experiences Slight Correction At $25,000 
 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $24,478 and has been unable to break the $25,000 level decisively. Given the strong rejection at $25k, analysts believe Bitcoin may enter a period of consolidation before making a fresh move.

The Devastating Impact Of Dollar Dominance
 
2022 devastated cryptocurrencies and other risk assets due to the seemingly endless dominance of the dollar. The DXY Dollar Currency Index climbed to the highest levels since the inception of Bitcoin. 
 
Because USD is one half of most cryptocurrency trading pairs due to the dollar being the global reserve currency, when the dollar is strong, the other side of the pair weakens. 
 
 
As momentum began to turn down in the DXY, it started to turn up across crypto. The last few months have provided a much needed relief rally across the asset clas…]]></summary>

Today, the NBA Hall of Fame player Paul Pierce settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over charges of unlawful touting digital asset EthereumMax, which the regulator considers a ‘crypto security.’
 
This comes after the SEC continues to crack down on the crypto industry. Pierce was charged with the same offense as other celebrities who had something to do with promoting the cash grab scheme supported by the EthereumMax project.  
 
The Offense, The Judgement, And The EthereumMax Lesson 
 
In 2021, NBA legend Pierce promoted EthereumMax tokens. According to the SEC, this is considered an offense as Pierece failed to disclose that he was promoting the token for a profit.

The central bank’s failure to pay its debts on time will likely force the affected financial institutions to similarly delay paying back their own forex-denominated debts.
 
Nigeria’s Declining Oil Revenues
 
Nigeria’s perennial shortage of foreign exchange may likely result in the country’s central bank failing to repay domestic lenders on time, the rating agency Moody’s Investors Service has said. As reported by Bloomberg, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) owes the West African nation’s so-called rated commercial lenders about $10.4 billion which the bank received in the form of swaps and forwards.
