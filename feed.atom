        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hotbit, a cryptocurrency exchange, is shutting down, according to a statement issued on May 22. Hotbit, which currently supports the trading of various crypto assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and others, says its clients have until 4:00 AM UTC on June 21, to withdraw their assets, and they will officially stop all exchange operations from today, May 22, at 4:00 AM, UTC.
 
The exchange cites various challenges ranging from the effects of the recent crypto winter to increasingly tight regulations. Considering these emerging changes, the exchange also gave a very bleak prediction about the future of crypto ramps saying they might not have a bright future.

SC announced the enforcement action on Tuesday, noting that it also ordered Huobi to stop circulating or publishing any advertisements targeted at Malaysian investors, whether

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tron rose for a fourth consecutive session on Monday, pushing the token to an eleven-month high. The move comes despite current sentiment of uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market. Cardano was also higher, snapping a losing streak in the process. 
 
TRON (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) rose close to an eleven-month high to start the week, following a recent four-day bull run.
 
TRX/USD rose to a peak of $0.07841 earlier in the day, which comes a day after trading at a low of $0.07271.
 
As a result of Monday’s move, TRON climbed to its strongest point since June 10 last year.
 
 
One of the catalysts of the surge appears to be a breakout which transpired on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
The index moved beyond the ceiling of 69.00, and as of writing, is tracking at 77.17.
 
Now in overbought territory, there could be some profit taking, however a target of $0.080 still remains a possibility.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Whilst TRX has now risen for a fourth day, cardano (ADA) ended a four-session losing streak on Monday.
 
Following a low of $0.3573 on Sunday, ADA/USD rose by as much as 2% today, hitting a high of $0.3732.
 
Today’s rebound in price came as bulls seemingly rejected a breakout of a floor at the $0.3570 mark.
 
 
This came as the RSI also held firm at a key point of support, with price strength moving away from the 40.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 44.29, with a ceiling at 49.00 a possible target for ADA bulls.
 
If this zone is reached, there is a relatively good chance cardano will be trading above $0.3800.

Buterin’s post follows massive congestion on the Bitcoin network, which led to a surge in transaction fees.
 
Possible Risks of Consensus Overload
 
Crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum use the consensus mechanism to validate transaction authenticity and maintain the security of the underlying blockchain.
 
 
This consensus mechanism influences how a blockchain network verifies transactions while determining network fees, transaction speed, and more.
