        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin remained above a key support point on Friday, despite bears attempting to push the price below $29,000. Today’s session saw sentiment once again shift bearish, as U.S. consumer sentiment data looms. Ethereum was mostly unchanged in today’s session. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade above the $29,000 mark on Friday, despite bearish pressure intensifying in today’s session.
 
After hitting a high of $29,520.71 on Thursday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $29,099.35 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw bitcoin briefly fall below a support point at $29,200, however prices have since climbed back above this point.

This latest slippage comes as the 10-day (red) moving average continued its downward cross versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) neared a breakout below a floor at 41.00, however it has so far avoided this.
 
Should this take place, the next possible destination for BTC could be $28,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) traded above its own support point at $1,850 on Friday, as the cryptocurrency continued consolidating.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,855.32 earlier in today’s session, a day after peaking at $1,878.43.
 
The price consolidation comes as the RSI failed to move above a current resistance level at 48.00.

As of writing, the index is on the cusp of crossing this line, however momentum is still relatively weak.
 
There could likely be a spark later in the day, depending on how traders react to the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report.

Among such discussions, the forthcoming BTC halving and the potential United States approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF have captured much attention.

BTC Halving: An Overhyped Non-event?
 
Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, and market analyst, has stirred up the crypto waters with his bold claims. He suggests that these widely-expected events might be mere non-events, triggering waves of surprise across the crypto community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Defining Fiat Money
Fiat money is tender not backed by a tangible asset or commodity like gold or silver. It’s usually mandated by governments, but this isn’t always the case. The currencies we use for everyday transactions in the modern era are all examples of fiat money, such as the U.S. dollar (USD), the euro (EUR), the pound (GBP) or the Chinese Yuan (CNY).
The term “fiat” is a Latin word that means “by decree” or “let it be done,” representing an arbitrary order that reflects the issuance of money as a government enactment. Fiat is one form of money, along with representative and commodity money. While fiat money comes in various forms — physical banknotes, coins or digital units — representative money merely “represents” an intent to pay, like a cheque. Commodity money h…]]></summary>

In “The Fiat Standard,” economist Saifedean Ammous argues at length that the United States federal government has been propagandizing the masses into choosing “cheap industrial substitutes” and “massively reducing (its) meat consumption” since at least 1916. 
As Ammous wrote:
