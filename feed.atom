To make matters worse, the few African individuals who have made it either as traders or entrepreneurs often lack the desire to help their fellow residents become acquainted with the basics.
 
Using Education to Strike Back Against Scammers
 
However, Festo, who claims to have bought his first bitcoins in 2009, said African governments’ negative disposition as well as the stigma surrounding cryptos and the blockchain industry have helped convince some successful traders and entrepreneurs to reconsider.

The “mining hashrate” refers to the total computing power currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. The metric is measured in terms of hashes per second, where “hashes” refer to calculations that miners have to make.
 
When this indicator’s value goes up, the miners are connecting more mining rigs to the network. Such a trend can indicate that these chain validators are now finding the coin attractive to mine.
 
On the other hand, the metric’s value decreasing suggests some miners disconnect from the blockchain, possibly because they aren’t making any profits.
