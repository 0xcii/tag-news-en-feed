        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Similar to bitcoin’s price, the second leading digital currency in terms of market cap, ethereum, is down on Monday, losing 3% against the U.S. dollar. Oscillating within a 24-hour range of $2,017 to $2,088, ethereum maintains a market capitalization of $243 billion. Current technical indicators offer a nuanced perspective on ethereum’s market position on Monday.
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum’s price, recorded at $2,019, indicates a downward phase amidst the volatile crypto market. Despite this, oscillators present a predominantly neutral stance. The relative strength index (RSI) stands at 55.8, while the Stochastic and commodity channel index (CCI) are at 66.5 and 23.8, respectively. These figures suggest a balanced market condition, with some slight bearish signals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin transaction fee surpassed that of Ethereum during the last week as it hit a total of $61 million.
 
Bitcoin Transaction Fees Has Been Higher Than Ethereum Recently
 
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, BTC transaction fees have recently surpassed that of ETH. The “transaction fees” here refer to the amount that every sender on the respective network has to attach with their transfer as a reward for the chain validator who processes the move.
 
How much fees the average user would attach depends on the traffic conditions on the blockchain at the time. When there is a high amount of traffic on the network, some transfers can get stuck for a while, as the chain validators have only a limited capacity to handle them.
