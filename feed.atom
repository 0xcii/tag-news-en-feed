        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/south-africa-navigates-crypto-regulations-to-license-60-firms-this-month/"/>
        <updated>2024-03-13T19:59:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Africa is planning to license approximately 60  
cryptocurrency platforms by the end of March. According to a report by  
Bloomberg, this initiative by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA)  
underscores the nation's proactive approach towards regulating the burgeoning  
crypto sector.
The FSCA revealed that the response exceeded  
expectations, with more than 300 crypto-asset providers seeking regulatory  
approval. The deadline for application for the licenses is set for November 30.  

Utilizing Existing Regulatory Frameworks
Rather than developing a standalone regulatory  
framework for crypto operators, the FSCA has opted to leverage the existing  
Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act. 
By bringing crypto exchanges under the purview of this  
regulation, South Africa aims to bolster consumer protections and  
accountability within the sector. Notably, the new guidelines offer a recourse  
in case of breaches or misconduct by the crypto platform’s operators. This regulatory oversight aims to instill confidence  
among investors and mitigate potential risks associated with crypto trading.

South Africa will license about 60 cryptocurrency platforms by the end of the month, placing it among the first nations on the continent to oblige digital-asset exchanges to have permits to operate https://t.co/zRIB7femKd
— Bloomberg (@business) March 13, 2024
Future Regulatory Developments
Commissioner Kamlana acknowledged that while the FAIS  
Act serves as a robust foundation for crypto regulation, ongoing supervision  
may reveal gaps that necessitate additional measures. 
As the FSCA continues to license and monitor crypto  
platforms, it remains open to refining regulatory frameworks to address  
emerging challenges effectively.
