Concurrently, while a host of new entrants enjoyed strong inflows, Grayscale’s GBTC encountered notable outflows, coinciding with the fund’s discount to net asset value reaching its lowest point since February 2021. 
 
Reduced NAV Discount Prompts GBTC Outflows
 
On Saturday, Eric Balchunas, the senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, shared insights on the “nine newborn” spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have impressively gathered $1.4 billion in cash. Balchunas observed that this surge in capital markedly outstrips the $579 million outflow…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that sent ripples through the Bitcoin community, renowned investor and Shark Tank personality Kevin O’Leary doused the flames of hype surrounding the recent approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, labeling them “practically useless” for institutional investors.
 
But amidst his skepticism, O’Leary offered a ray of sunshine for Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, predicting a significant price surge by 2030.
 
O’Leary: ETFs Fee Concerns, Predicts Shakeout
 
O’Leary’s main gripe with Spot ETFs? Fees. He argues that the charges levied by issuers, even with temporary waivers, render them an unattractive proposition for sophisticated investors who can simply hold Bitcoin directly.
