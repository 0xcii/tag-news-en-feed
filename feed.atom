One of these principles is the ban on taking interest on a loan. The ban is mentioned in the weekly Torah reading Ki Tzei.
Bitcoin = the protocol and payment network.
bitcoin = the currency.
The Ban On Interest

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Co-Founder of the collapsed crypto fund Three  
Arrows Capital (3AC), Su Zhu, has faced questioning in a court in Singapore.  
This investigation, as reported by Bloomberg, marks a significant step in the  
search for answers by liquidators seeking to recover $3.3 billion for  
creditors. 
This interrogation, which was conducted for two  
days, sought to unravel the mysteries surrounding the collapse of 3AC and the  
whereabouts of its assets. The liquidators have accused Zhu and his Co-Founder, Kyle Davies, of obstructing investigations, aiming to recover $1.3 billion from  
the duo.
Zhu's interrogation, orchestrated by lawyers  
representing the liquidator Teneo, delved into the failure of the fund and the

media publication reported, citing insiders, that Zhu's detainment in September

Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves...
