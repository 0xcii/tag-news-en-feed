Regulatory Crackdown Forces Binance Executives To Resign?
 
Farnell joined Binance in May 2021 and took on the role of CEO of Eqonex, the holding company of crypto custodian Digivault, in 2022. This move aligned with a loan agreement that gave the exchange the authority to appoint a CEO from within Bifinity.

As Bitcoin commands renewed interest and experiences a revival, it’s ironic to witness numerous other tokens getting the chop from major platforms.
 
According to data compiled by Kaiko, the numbers are clear: 3,445 tokens or trading pairs are on the chopping block, having been rendered inactive or slated for imminent delisting. In a comparative analysis, this figure overshadows last year’s numbers by 15% and even doubles those of the year prior, as reported by Bloomberg.
