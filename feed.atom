        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A UK judge has ruled that Craig Wright, who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, lied extensively and forged documents during a high-profile trial.
In a scathing 231-page judgment, Justice James Mellor stated that Wright "lied to the court repeatedly" and committed forgery "on a grand scale" in a failed attempt to prove he was Nakamoto. 
A group of crypto firms brought the civil trial, the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), that sought to prevent Wright from claiming he invented Bitcoin.

BREAKING: 🇬🇧 Judge has just published his ruling in the COPA vs Craig Wright lawsuit that Craig is not Satoshi Nakamoto.
