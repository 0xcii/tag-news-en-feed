        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. In a world stifled by bureaucracy and conformity, anonymous Bitcoin ATM operator Shitcoins.club stands as a beacon of rebellion and disruptive technology. Their CEO, a visionary with a penchant for challenging norms, declared, “We’re here to break the mould and disrupt the status quo, one irreverent name at a time”.
 
The company’s very existence is a testament to the fact that the blockchain revolution was ignited by a desire to defy the established order, not to capitulate to the corporate facade. Nothing proves this better than the carpet designs that have been laid down at over 200 of the company’s locations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elon Musk, the visionary entrepreneur behind SpaceX and Tesla, has long been a force to be reckoned with in the realms of technology and innovation. But now, it seems his influence might extend even further, into the political arena. 
 
According to Bitcoin maximalist and former CTO of Coinbase, Balaji Srinivasan, there’s a surprising revelation: Elon Musk can run for President of the United States, despite facing some expected roadblocks.
 
Balaji’s assertion is not based on mere speculation; it draws from a groundbreaking poll conducted by Harvard University’s Center for American Political Studies.
 
 
The poll unveiled a stunning reality that propels Musk into a league of his own – he’s not just competing with traditional political figures; he is, in fact, the most favorably viewed amon…]]></summary>

A recently released report by Beosin, a blockchain security firm, revealed that the total value of cryptocurrencies lost in scams, hacks, and rug pulls targeting Web3 platforms reached $656.61 million during the first half of 2023. For comparison, $1.9 billion was lost to Web3 scams in the same quarter last year. 
 
DeFi Platforms Remain The Most Frequent Target
 
Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms were hit the hardest by scams and hacks in the first half of 2023.
