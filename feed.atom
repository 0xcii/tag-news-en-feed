93% Of Bitcoin Addresses Are In The Money
 
As of July 22, Bitcoin is stable and down roughly 8% from all-time highs of around $74,000. IntoTheBlock data showed that 93% of all addresses are in the green at spot rates. 
 
 
If anything, it is a major recovery and a turnaround, especially after the major sell-off of June and early July 2024, when prices plunged to as low as $53,500 before bouncing off.
 
 
 
 
At the current valuation, a minority of BTC holders are in the red. These entities most likely bought at around $72,000 or all-time highs, expecting prices to roar to $100,000.
