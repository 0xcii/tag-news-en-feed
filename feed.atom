If This Happens, Bitcoin Could Surge To $100,000 By November
 
“As we approach the US election, I expect $100,000 to be reached and then $150,000 by year-end in the case of a Trump victory,” Kendrick stated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum is still working on a complementary plan for parallel EVM, but Bitcoin can be soon expecting its own parallel VM layer 2. 
Let’s firstly understand why Ethereum cannot achieve parallel EVM.
To maintain network consistency and security, EVM has a crucial feature in its design: transactions are executed sequentially. Sequential execution ensures that transactions and smart contracts can be executed in a deterministic order, making it easier to manage and predict the blockchain's state. This design choice prioritizes security, reducing potential complexities and vulnerabilities associated with parallel execution. However, under high loads of transaction requests, this sequential execution can lead to network congestion and delays, similar to a single-lane highway.

The prediction comes amidst a backdrop of economic indicators and political developments influencing the Bitcoin market. Kendrick highlighted that the next significant driver for Bitcoin's price would be the U.S. election.
Kendrick also noted that Bitcoin could reach a new record over the weekend if the nonfarm payrolls report, to be released on Friday, is favorable. Bitcoin's current all time high, set on March 14, stands at $73,770. A positive jobs report could pave the way for Bitcoin to reach $80,000 later this month, he noted.
The forecast underscores the significant impact political developments can have on the Bitcoin market. With over 50 million Bitcoin and crypto holders in the United States, the outcome of the presidential election is poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future of Bitcoin.]]></summary>
