        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a trial set to commence on March 26 in the Dutch city of Hertogenbosch, Alexey Pertsev, the prominent developer behind Tornado Cash, finds himself at the center of a legal storm as he faces money laundering charges. The allegations, revealed in a three-page indictment obtained by DL News, accuse Pertsev of laundering over $1.2 billion in illicit funds.
 
 
According to Dutch prosecutors, Pertsev, who was arrested in August 2022, is accused of habitually engaging in money laundering activities.
 
However, his defense lawyer, Keith Cheng, maintains that the indictment lacks specificity regarding the exact acts Pertsev is alleged to have committed in relation to the criminal offense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lithuania-licensed crypto bank Meld plans to offer  
real-world assets in partnership with the decentralized finance platform Swarm  
Markets. This offering, which targets retail crypto investors, aims to  
democratize access to traditional asset classes within the crypto space.
Transforming Real-World Assets
According to a report by Coindesk, Meld intends to  
introduce on-chain lending and borrowing services for tokenized assets. This  
service will enable retail investors to leverage their existing holdings  
against crypto assets like Bitcoin.
Besides that, the crypto bank plans to introduce  
cross-asset margining opportunities previously inaccessible through  
conventional means. Recently, Meld secured a virtual asset service provider  
license in Lithuania, paving the way for its compliance with the Market in  
Crypto Assets regulations within the European Union.

Regulatory Compliance and Market Expansion
As the crypto banking sector continues to evolve,  
there is a growing demand for financial services bridging the digital asset  
space and the traditional financial sector. Meld has reported more than 75,000  
prospective sign-ups for the new offering.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The scalability debate within the Solana ecosystem has reached a fever pitch, fueled by pointed discussions on X (formerly Twitter) among leading figures in the blockchain space.

As the price of bitcoin rises, a lot of traders start to shift from their typical buying and selling locations. Rather, they use borrowed funds to gamble on highly volatile meme currencies in an attempt to chase after popular coins, which can fluctuate on a daily basis.
 
 
 
When prices go up and on-chain/perps start moving people don’t need slots any more, they can just long the memecoin du jour on leverage.
