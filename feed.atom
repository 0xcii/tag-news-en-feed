        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent report released on Tuesday, undisclosed sources detailed that the firm behind the top stablecoin in market cap, tether (USDT), is now banking with Britannia Bank & Trust. In the past month, tether’s supply has dipped by 1.3%, leaving 82.85 billion USDT in circulation.
 
Undisclosed Sources Say Tether Is Working With a Privately Held Bahamas-Based Bank
 
On August 29, Bloomberg journalists Yueqi Yang and Olga Kharif spotlighted Tether’s new partnership with the privately held Bahamas-based Britannia Bank & Trust for its banking services. The timeline of when Tether teamed up with Britannia remains hazy, but insiders revealed that the stablecoin giant is guiding its clientele to transfer funds to the bank’s Bahamian account number.
 
This revelation surfaces amidst challenges cryptocurrency firms face in clinching banking affiliations within the U.S., especially after the monumental downfall of three major U.S. banks last March – one of the most significant financial tremors in the nation’s history. Yang and Kharif shared that both Tether and Britannia declined to comment on the matter. Currently, tether boasts a market cap slightly surpassing $82 billion, with recent data highlighting a 1.3% drop in its reservoir.
 
 
In the latest 24-hour snapshot, USDT dominated the crypto trading scene, amassing an impressive $40.18 billion in global trade volume out of the $72.42 billion aggregate. This update is hot on the heels of Tether’s announcement to cease support for three blockchains: Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash, and Kusama.

        <updated>2023-08-30T17:17:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC to 75% by the end of this year, and 95% by the end of 2024.
"The chances of the SEC approving spot Bitcoin ETFs this year have risen from 75% from 65% following Grayscale's court win, we believe, while the odds by the end of 2024 reach 95%," said the analysts. "The judges unanimously repudiated the SECs arguments, and the agency will struggle to justify further denials as it faces deadlines, negative PR and HashDex's novel approach." 
Yesterday, the DC Circuit court of appeals vacated the SEC's denial of Grayscale's $GBTC conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF. While this did not result in GBTC automatically being converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, this victory was a big step towards the approval of one in the future. 
 "The appeals court found the SEC to be arbitrary and capricious in its denial oder of GBTC's conversion into an ETF and vacated the decision," the analysts continued. "The written opinion from Judge Neomi Rao repudiated virtually every argument made by the SEC when comparing the Bitcoin spot and futures markets." 
A SEC decision on multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs is due by the end of this week, with many believing the applications will be further delayed as these so close to the Grayscale court outcome that just happened. Although, Balchunas said he's "not sure timelines will matter as much in this situation," and that what is more likely is that eventually the SEC will give in and approve an imminent launch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash (BCH) was one of Wednesday’s biggest gainers, as markets remained jubilant following the Grayscale court ruling. Following a recent streak of consolidation, the global crypto market cap rose by as much as 4% on the news. toncoin (TON) also surged, climbing nearly 16% higher.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was a notable gainer on Wednesday, as the price was once again trading above the $200 level. BCH/USD peaked at $227.03 late on Tuesday’s session, following a low at $192.77 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw the price breakout out of a resistance level of $225.00, hitting a two-week high in the process.
 
 
As of writing this, earlier gains have since eased, with the cryptocurrency once again trading below the aforementioned ceiling.
 
This came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with its own resistance level at 60.00. In the event bulls manage to orchestrate a breakout, BCH will likely be above $240.00.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
For a second straight session, toncoin (TON) surged considerably higher, with today’s gains seeing a price jump of over 12%.
 
Following a low of $1.52 on Tuesday, TON/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $1.75 earlier in today’s session. This resulted in the cryptocurrency climbing to its highest point since June 5, when the price was at $1.77.
 
 
After peaking at 70.41 less than 24 hours ago, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 75.38.
 
Many now expect an upcoming reversal, due to TON being highly overbought, as a result of this recent bull run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the evolving Bitcoin market, stories of missed opportunities and astonishing deals abound – however, few are as eye-popping as this sale from August 30, 2010. 
Unearthed by Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo, a BitcoinTalk thread shows how an early Bitcoin user amassed 30,000 BTC, only to sell them for $0.03 each. 
Then sold below market price, roughly $0.06 at the time, the sale netted $900. The same amount of Bitcoin, if sold today, would be worth over $810,000,000. 
 
         
         
         
         
    
While few could have predicted the meteoric rise of Bitcoin to $27,000 in the years to come, it seems the seller in this case might have been motivated by an interest in disproving that the cryptocurrency would work at all. 
Though there is only speculation in the thread, it shows that market participants at the time believed the seller to be William “Nenolod” Pitcock, a data center employee who is said to have amassed close to 100,000 BTC that he liquidated in 2010. 
Speaking about another sale in July, he discussed his motivation was to spark a “bank rush,” writing: “The purpose was to demonstrate in two ways that the Bitcoin system can be attacked… [and] cause speculation in the bitcoin economy.”
While no connection between the events can be substantiated, the thread, buried in the archives of an early Bitcoin user forum, serves as a time capsule, transporting readers back to a moment when the true potential of Bitcoin was still shrouded in uncertainty.
While some may view it as a painful reminder of missed opportunities, others see it as a testament to the enduring allure that Bitcoin has created over the years.
Either wary, thanks to the sale, some lucky Bitcoiners were able to get bids filled at once-in-a-lifetime prices.]]></summary>
