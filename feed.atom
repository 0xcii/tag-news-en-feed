This move is to introduce a spot ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Nasdaq. This development comes on the heels of Blackrock establishing the trust in Delaware and unveiling a 19b-4 filing just last week.
 
Blackrock Submits Ishares Ethereum Trust S-1 Filing With SEC
 
The asset manager Blackrock has presented its S-1 form to the SEC, initiating the review process for its proposed Ishares Ethereum Trust ETF. Precisely a week earlier, the trust was registered in Delaware, and its 19b-4 was made public for recordkeeping purposes. The submission to the SEC characterizes the ETF as an “emerging growth company.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's officially been one year since the nation of El Salvador became the first to begin buying Bitcoin every day, joining the millions of savers around the world who dollar cost average into the cryptocurrency.
As profiled by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo today, it was on this date last year when El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele committed to purchasing one bitcoin every day. One year later, the results are in, Bitcoin is up 120%.
While it is unclear whether El Salvador stuck to the plan, if it has, it has amassed a total of 365 bitcoins at a reported cost of $13 million during that time. However, the cost basis for these acquisitions is notably lower at $9.5 million, or a $3 million gain.
The results showcase the potential benefits of consistent and measured investment in the volatile Bitcoin market.
Time will tell if the results will silence critics, however, who have been critical of the country's strategy. El Salvador has faced scrutiny for its Bitcoin purchasing efforts, with skepticism arising from the lack of transparency regarding the actual purchases. While President Bukele has publicly disclosed the ownership of 2,381 bitcoins acquired at an average price of around $44,300, there remains a challenge in verifying these claims.
As a result, El Salvador may, at least temporarily, still be down on its overall Bitcoin investment. The country became the first in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021, a move that has boosted tourism but drawn the scrutiny of international regulators who fear it is moving away from the U.S. dollar.
As the nation continues to navigate this uncharted territory, the impact of its pioneering DCA plan, should it have followed through on the promise, will no doubt go a long way toward mitigating concerns given its strong performance.]]></summary>

Solana Vs. Ethereum
 
Mumtaz starts out by explaining; “Spot the asymmetry: Solana has exceeded 700 user TPS regularly in the past week — Ethereum does 12 TPS. That’s a 60x difference.” He further emphasized the significant disparity in transaction finality speeds, with SOL achieving approximately 400 milliseconds compared to Ethereum’s roughly 15 minutes. This represents a 2,250x difference.
