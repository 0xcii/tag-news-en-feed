In a significant move against the illicit production of these dangerous drugs, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has unsealed eight indictments.

Department of Justice (DOJ) claimed that his crypto business had problems from  
the beginning. The Assistant US Attorney Nathan Rehn described him as someone  
who deceived customers and used their money for his own gain, including wealth

According to Rehn, Bankman-Fried diverted customers' funds to  
a "smaller and secretive" company called Alameda Research, using them  
for personal luxuries and political donations. The prosecution alleges that  
Bankman-Fried took over $10 billion from FTX to settle Alameda Research's debts

The investors with coins this old make up a segment of the “long-term holders (LTHs),” which is a cohort that includes all addresses carrying their Bitcoin since at least 155 days ago.
 
Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell or transfer the coins at any point. Due to this reason, the LTHs are the resolute hands of the market, who rarely sell even during periods of high profits or losses.
