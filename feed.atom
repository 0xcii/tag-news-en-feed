        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Famous Pershing Square Capital Management founder and CEO Bill Ackman has turned his focus to Bitcoin, which has sparked a passionate discussion over the possible consequences of the cryptocurrency’s recent surge. Ackman made a playful scenario presentation on social media, which made many in the industry wonder what it could mean for the biggest cryptocurrency in the world.
 
 
Bitcoin And The Energy Dilemma
 
The conversation ignited when Ackman responded directly to a user’s post, highlighting the significant energy consumption resulting from the recent surge in BTC prices.
 
In his unconventional scenario, he suggests a chain reaction: the rally in Bitcoin prices leads to increased mining, subsequently driving up energy costs.
 
This, he argues, could trigger an inflationary surge and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI, the research company synonymous with Worldcoin and the groundbreaking generative AI like ChatGPT, finds itself at a crossroads. Just months after a dramatic firing and swift reinstatement, CEO Sam Altman has rejoined the board, but the dust from the incident hasn’t settled. Legal battles, a changing board landscape, and fierce competition paint a picture of an organization in flux.
 
 
Second Chances And Shifting Leadership
 
Altman’s November 2023 dismissal, shrouded in secrecy, sent shockwaves through the AI community. The move, spearheaded by the then-existing board, sparked an employee revolt and intervention from major investor Microsoft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Analysts are optimistic about the price trajectory of Bitcoin leading up to the upcoming halving event in April 2024. Projections indicate a potential surge in value post-halving, with estimates ranging from an average peak price of $87,800 to even reaching as high as $100,000, or more.
 
 
This anticipated price increase is fueled by the expected reduction in Bitcoin’s inflation rate following the halving, historically a catalyst for bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market.
 
The world’s most famous cryptocurrency has been on a tear lately, recently surpassing the dizzying heights of $70,000 for the first time ever. But with great gains often comes the fear of great losses, and analysts are scrambling to predict what the future holds for this volatile digital asset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meme coins have ballooned to new prices since the beginning of March, boosting blockchain activity in the process. This recent frenzy has seen Ethereum gas fees surging to two-year highs this week. 
 
IntoTheBlock, a leading on-chain analytics provider, announced this new milestone in a recent post on social media platform X. Data from ITB indicates that Ethereum mainnet’s revenue from network fees reached $193 million this week, pushing the annualized rate to the highest point since early 2022. 
 
 
Ethereum’s $190M+ in weekly fees puts it at an annualized rate of over $10B for the first time since early 2022. 
Due to Ethereum’s fee-burn mechanism, this also has an impact on the supply, decreasing it by 33k ETH (~$125M) this week. pic.twitter.com/iAibEvzh4j
