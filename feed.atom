        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin crept back up to the $21,000 level on Friday, as volatility in the cryptocurrency market remained high. After falling by nearly 4% in Thursday’s session, the global market cap is up by 1.14% as of writing. This comes despite the news that crypto lender Genesis has recently filed for bankruptcy. Ethereum was also in the green, as it rebounded from Thursday’s lows.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) climbed higher on Friday, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency rebounded from Thursday’s losses.
 
The rally comes despite the news that crypto lender Genesis has filed for bankruptcy, following the likes of FTX.
 
BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $21,175.24 earlier in today’s session, which comes following a low of $20,689.88 on Thursday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s rebound in price came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved back above the 80.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is at the 80.40 level, with the next visible resistance level at the 88.00 zone.
 
Many expect that BTC could make another attempt to break out of a key resistance point at $21,400.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also rebounded during today’s session, with prices continuing to move away from a recent floor.
 
Following a low of $1,515.79 on Thursday, ETH/USD raced to a peak of $1,559.55 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s surge comes as ethereum continues to move away from a recent support point at the $1,500 level.
 
 
Similar to BTC, the move comes following a dead cat bounce on the RSI indicator, with price strength rebounding from a recent low.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at a level of 74.64, which is marginally higher than the aforementioned floor at 70.00.
 
ETH bulls will likely now be targeting a resistance level at the $1,600 level.

This is an opinion editorial by Okada, mechanical engineer and contributor to peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange RoboSats.
Buying your first bitcoin has dramatically changed since the early days of trading on forums or Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Large exchanges sprung up and nowadays, they’ve perfected the art of attracting newbies through demystifying the buying experience with seamless and, quite frankly, mindless user interfaces.
Over time, regulators pressured exchanges into collecting users’ data to verify their personal credentials. Exchanges such as these — we’ll call them “verification” exchanges (VEXs) — have custody of your funds and have tools …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the deputy governor of the Somalian central bank, Ali Yasin Wardheere, the institution plans to fight inflation and currency counterfeiters with newly issued shilling banknotes. The bank reportedly said it hopes to complete the process of replacing old and high-value shilling bills with newly designed banknotes in 2024. 
 
Preserving the Value of New Money
 
The Central Bank of Somalia (CBS) plans to replace old, high-value shilling bills that have been in circulation since 1991 with redesigned banknotes. The central bank hopes this process, which it expects to complete by 2024, will help the war-torn country fight inflation as well as undercut counterfeit currency dealers, a report said.
 
In his remarks during an interview with Bloomberg, Ali Yasin Wardheere, the deputy governor at the CBS, revealed that the central bank began replacing high-value bills with redesigned banknotes in 2018. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have both assisted with this process, Wardheere reportedly said.
 
According to the deputy governor, the central bank has also established a unit with a mandate of “combating the counterfeit money market.” The unit is further tasked with the job of preserving the value of the new currency that the central bank is planning to print.
 

 
To help the central bank achieve some of the objectives, Wardheere said the CBS would establish new branches in the capitals of federal member states. These branches, which the central bank hopes to have in place by June, will help the CBS collect taxes and store money.
 
Since the ouster of Siad Baare in 1991, Somalia has not issued new shilling banknotes while the old ones are now worn out and not widely available. As a result, the use of U.S. dollars and privately printed currency has grown.

“Everything is briefed. Now we wait,” Filan wrote. From now on, it’s up to Judge Analisa Torres to make a decision based on all the arguments presented in the more than two-year trial.
