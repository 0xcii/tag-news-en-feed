Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are believed to have maintained unimpressive price actions partly because of Bitcoin. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Dogecoin and Shiba Inu’s price correlation with the flagship crypto is almost close to ‘1’, which “implies a strong positive correlation” between their prices and that of Bitcoin.
