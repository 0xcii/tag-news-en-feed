Because of that, I wanted to design it to support every possible transaction type I could think of. The problem was, each thing required special support code and data fields whether it was used or not, and only covered one special case at a time. It would have been an explosion of special cases.

Current price action shows the cryptocurrency is moving to break past a resistance level of around $0.16. A crypto analyst known pseudonymously as World Of Charts believes the potential of this breakout happening is very strong and DOGE is primed for a surge to a price target between $0.27 to $0.30, which represents a 100% surge on the upper end.
