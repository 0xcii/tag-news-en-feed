        <updated>2024-07-29T13:04:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency exchange OKX has launched  
pre-market futures, which allow users to trade futures contracts with two-times leverage for upcoming tokens before they are sold to the public. 
Participating in Upcoming Token Launches
According to the company's announcement, the new  
feature allows traders to engage with upcoming tokens even before their  
official market debut. By offering futures contracts with leverage, OKX has  
promised to create a platform that opens up new avenues in the crypto trading  
world.
The futures incorporate mechanisms from its expiry  
futures product, aiming to provide a better experience than traditional  
peer-to-peer (P2P) pre-market offerings. This offering reportedly enables  
customers to trade without needing to hold the underlying asset.
Speaking about the new offering, OKX's Global Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai, said: "Our unique approach to assisting in the price discovery process for early-stage tokens is backed by our robust risk engine and extensive experience. By opening up new avenues to participate in crypto, we aim to make trading more accessible, efficient, and appealing."
OKX's Pre-Market Futures grants traders early entry  
into the market, allowing them to engage in price discovery and capitalize on  
the initial buzz around new tokens. This feature aims to provide superior  
liquidity compared to existing P2P-based pre-market products.
Enhancing P2P Pre-market Products
Additionally, OKX's new product promises lower fees  
compared to other major P2P-based pre-market products, making it a  
cost-effective option for traders looking to launch new token offerings. The first token available for Pre-Market Futures  
trading is the HMSTR token from the Telegram mini-app game Hamster Kombat. This  
addition exemplifies OKX's commitment to providing exciting new opportunities  
for its users.

Bitcoin Hashrate Hits Record Highs
 
Data from the Hashrate Index shows that BTC hit a new all-time high network hashrate of 677 EH/s on July 26, surpassing its previous high of 656 EH/s recorded on May 27. This is based on data from the seven-day SMA (Simple Moving Average), which miners consider the most accurate estimate. 
 
 
 
However, the 3-day SMA provides an even more bullish outlook for Bitcoin’s hashrate, with the mining output touching a record high of 707 EH/s on July 23. An increase in the network’s hashrate usually means more computational power i…]]></summary>
