According to the seven-day simple moving average (SMA), it touched an impressive 440 exahash per second (EH/s). Notably, less than 200 days remain until the next block reward halving, equating to being roughly 28,468 blocks away.
 
Amid Global Tensions, Bitcoin Miners Navigate Record Hashrates and Halving Countdown
 
The countdown to Bitcoin’s halving is ticking away. As of now, 197 days remain, positioning the event on or about April 25, 2024. Yet, some trackers project an earlier date of April 21, 2024, and there’s even calculations showing a March 2024 occurrence.

Judge Kaplan Displeased At Defense’s Repetitive Questions
 
On October 5 (Day 3 of SBF’s trial), Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers cross-examined Adam Yedidia, a close friend of SBF and former employee of FTX. During the proceedings, the judge seemed frustrated at the defense’s line of questioning as he stated, “You’ve made your point. Move on. We’ve been up and down this mountain.”
 
 
Still, on the cross-examination, the defense tried to lay a foundation that SBF wasn’t vain or lavish when they asked Yedidia if they knew what k…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-matic-drops-to-10-day-low-atom-rebounds-from-key-support-level/"/>
        <updated>2023-10-10T15:39:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon fell for a fourth straight session on Tuesday, as traders pushed the cryptocurrency to a ten-day low. The decline comes as the global market cap remained in the red, having fallen by 0.37% at the time of writing. On the other hand, cosmos rebounded from its lowest point since mid-September.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) extended a recent losing streak in today’s session, as price fell for a fourth consecutive day.
 
Following a high of $0.5396 to start the week, MATIC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.5241 earlier in the day.
 
This move resulted in the cryptocurrency falling to its weakest point since September 29, when price bottomed out at $0.5163.
 
 
From the chart, it seems as though sellers are attempting to push MATIC to a support point at $0.5070.
 
In order to achieve this, the relative strength index (RSI) will need to hit its own floor at 40.00. It is currently sitting at 43.75.
 
Bulls may also be waiting to reenter the market, the closer polygon gets to the aforementioned support.
 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
After finding its own level of support to start the week, cosmos (ATOM) rebounded strongly on Tuesday.
 
ATOM/USD jumped to a peak at $7.14 earlier in today’s session, less than a day after trading at a low of $6.63.
 
Monday’s bottom was the lowest level that cosmos had hit since September 15, which is the last time price broke out of a floor at $6.65.
 
 
Today’s bounce comes as bulls rejected this downward sentiment, and they now look to be targeting a resistance zone of $7.60.
 
A upcoming ceiling at the 48.00 level on the RSI indicator will likely pose a big threat to this prospect occurring.

Ethereum Has Declined Under The $1,600 Mark Recently
 
Around the start of this month, Ethereum enjoyed some sharp upward momentum as the cryptocurrency reached the $1,750 level. Since that peak, however, the coin has struggled, as its price has now declined again under the $1,600 mark.
 
Yesterday, ETH even retested a brief $1,550, but the asset quickly found a rebound and has so far held above the level, as the chart below shows.
 

 
 
The bounce has been small, however, meaning that Ethereum could be in danger of making another retest of the $1,550 level in the coming days. Something that may hold hints regarding if more decline is coming could be the investor…]]></summary>

In this article, we will be diving into a new theory that suggests that Bitcoin is moving through a larger 16-year cycle which can help us predict the direction of the Bitcoin price in the coming years. 
The Regular 4 Year Cycle
Bitcoin tends to go through 4-year cycles which are divided into 2 parts, the uptrend and the downtrend. A regular 4-year cycle consists of a 3-year uptrend followed by a 1-year downtrend also known as a bear market. So far Bitcoin h…]]></summary>

cryptocurrency exchange FTX enters its second week, his legal team has sought  
permission from Judge Lewis Kaplan to cross-examine Gary Wang, the Co-Founder of  
FTX, about the legal advice he received regarding loans obtained from Alameda  
Research. 
In a letter addressed to Judge Kaplan yesterday (Monday), prosecutors  
have already questioned Wang about the substantial loans he allegedly received  
from the hedge fund, which he used for venture investments and to buy a house in the  
Bahamas. SBF's defense argues that Wang believed these loans were legitimate  
and had been structured by lawyers. This perspective aims to challenge the idea  
that these loans were intended to conceal the source of the funds.

how Alameda managed such significant redemptions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated recent losses on Tuesday, as focus shifts to Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. Traders will look for guidance from the report, to see the Fed’s stance on the economy, after opting to keep rates unchanged last month. Ethereum remains below $1,700 in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade below the $28,000 level on Tuesday, ahead of the release of last month’s FOMC minutes.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $27,715.85 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after hitting a low of $27,302.56.
 
Overall, although mid-term momentum appears to be bullish, bears seem to be looking to hit the $27,000 mark in the short-term.
 
 
The relative strength index (RSI) of 14 days remains on a downward trend, with a current reading at 54.95.
 
This comes as price strength attempts to find a floor, following a move away from a resistance level of 60.00.
 
Currently, BTC is trading at $27,518.86, however volatility will likely increase as we near tomorrow’s economic release.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) remained in the red, following the recent decision by the Ethereum Foundation to trade 1,700 tokens.
 
After a high of $1,596.97 to start the week, ETH/USD retreated to a low of $1,553.01 late in yesterday’s session.
 
This saw the cryptocurrency hit a one-month low, prompting bulls to buy the dip, pushing price to a current reading of $1,580.44.
 
 
From the chart, it seems that the recent decline has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average close to a downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In the event that this occurs, there will likely be further sell-offs, with ethereum almost certainly falling below $1,500.
