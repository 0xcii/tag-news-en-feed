Ledger Exploit Elicits Mixed Reactions From Crypto Sphere; Dapps and Tether Respond Promptly to Breach

The breach, which lasted less than two hours, did not impact Ledger’s hardware or Ledger Live but was confined to third-party decentralized applications (dapps) using the Connect Kit. However, this has raised questions about Ledger’s software security protocols.

obstacles that threaten to impede progress in the crypto space. The dual  
challenge involves hurdles related to retail customer access to crypto products  
and the complexities surrounding companies attempting to open and maintain  
banking accounts within the UK.
Retail Customer Access at Risk
Retail customers' ability to access crypto products faces a critical  
challenge and a driver behind this seems to be the stringent app reporting  
requirements imposed by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR). While these  
measures enhance risk management, they inadvertently deny potential customers  
access to essential financial services, creating a roadblock for crypto  
businesses.

Ethereum
 
Ethereum’s (ETH) market capitalization stands at $271 billion, accompanied by a 24-hour trade volume of around $17.54 billion.
