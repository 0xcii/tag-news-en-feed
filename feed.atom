Bitcoin Inflows To Accumulation Addresses Sharply Spiked Recently
 
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the accumulation addresses on the Bitcoin network have shown some significant inflow activity recently.
 
The “accumulation addresses” here refer to the Bitcoin wallets that have never made outgoing transactions on the blockchain. In other words, the accumulation addresses are basically the HODLers of the network.
 
Not every address with zero history of selling is included in this cohort, though, as there are some other requirements. The address must have at least two incoming transactions, the last of which must have occurre…]]></summary>
