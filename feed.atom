        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a dramatic conclusion to a five-year legal saga, Craig Wright, the controversial figure who claims to be the elusive creator of Bitcoin, has dropped his lawsuit against a prominent Bitcoin enthusiast known as Hodlonaut.
 
The culmination of this lengthy dispute marks a significant victory for Hodlonaut and casts further doubt on Wright’s assertions regarding his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto.
 
 
The origins of this legal feud trace back to May 2019 when Wright filed a lawsuit against Hodlonaut over critical social media posts.
 
Hodlonaut, a Norwegian Bitcoiner, had publicly accused Wright of being a “scammer” and a “fraud” for his claims of creating Bitcoin. This sparked a contentious legal battle that spanned multiple years and jurisdictions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam Bankman-Fried, the Founder and former CEO of the collapsed FTX, has challenged his conviction and sentencing for conspiracy and fraud by filing an appeal in court yesterday (Thursday). The appeal was filed just hours before the deadline.
SBF Appealed
Earlier, the judge had ordered Bankman-Fried to be remanded to a low or medium-security prison in Northern California. This facility is near his parents’ house, and the judge cited concerns for his security at a maximum-security prison due to his autism. Interestingly, during his trial and while awaiting sentencing, Bankman-Fried had requested to be kept in the notorious Manhattan Detention Center. Previously, he was an inmate at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.
The appeal came two weeks after a US court sentenced him to 25 years in prison, along with three years of supervised release. He is also required to forfeit $11 billion.
Billionaire to Convict
Bankman-Fried was once regarded as the messiah of the cryptocurrency world, known for his altruistic vision, signature T-shirt, and shorts outfit. He became one of the youngest self-made billionaires through his FTX empire, which collapsed overnight following the discovery of his dubious business practices.
After a high-profile trial, Bankman-Fried was convicted last November on multiple charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. Although the total maximum prison time for all the convictions could amount to 115 years, the prosecutors were seeking 40 to 50 years. Bankman-Fried’s legal team requested six-and-a-half years, but the court ultimately sentenced him to 25 years.
During the trial, several close associates of Bankman-Fried testified against him. They all pleaded guilty to their roles in the shady operations at FTX and are now awaiting sentencing.

The unexpected developments echo throughout the bitcoin space, igniting a fresh discussion about governmental overreach and its possible to inhibit innovation.
 
 
The tempest began when Uniswap CEO, Hayden Adams, disclosed that the SEC had issued a Wells Notice to the exchange, signaling the agency’s intent to pursue enforcement actions.
 
This revelation sent ripples through the crypto markets, with Uniswap’s native token, UNI, witnessing a precipitous 10% decline in value within a mere 24-hour period.

Bitcoin 7-Day Mining Hashrate Is Back Near ATH Levels
 
The “mining hashrate” refers to the total computing power that the miners have connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. This metric correlates with the network’s security.
 
To perform a successful 51% attack on the network, bad actors must gain control over at least 51% of the online mining rigs. When the hashrate goes up, the security naturally strengthens, as there are now more machines that an attacker needs to succeed.
 
 
Of course, this is only true if the new power being added to the network is properly decentralized. If the hashrate is centralized, the network risk may not decrease by the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin investors have recently seen the crypto stalling at the $0.2 mark as bullish sentiment amongst whales and other traders starts to falter. Interestingly, DOGE has yet to have a tangible breakout above the $0.2 mark since March 31. In fact, the crypto went on a decline in the first week of April to reach as low as $0.1719. 
 
Despite having reversed some of this decline at the time of writing, Dogecoin has yet to perform as many investors would expect. Furthermore, chart formation shows the cryptocurrency could be stuck in a bearish pattern and on-chain data indicates whales are selling their DOGE holdings. At the same time, short-term holders have seen their holdings increase, which makes them vulnerable to selloffs.
