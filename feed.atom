Crypto outflows took a breather last week, providing a glimmer of hope for an industry grappling with prolonged negative sentiment. According to recent data, digital-asset investment products saw $11.2 million flow out of the market, marking the eighth consecutive week of outflows. 
 
However, the silver lining in this dark cloud was Bitcoin, which defied the trend and attracted $3.8 million in inflows following Grayscale’s legal victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged a Hawaiian resident for falsely claiming that his fraudulent security would become the “first publicly traded security fund to convert to a cryptocurrency.” According to the Commission, the man promoted the security to boost its price and bolster the value of his portfolio.
 
Fabricated Documents Used to Perpetrate the Fraud
 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged a Hawaiian resident Jeremy Koski for allegedly fabricating and posting fake documents about a purported security that he said would become the “first publicly traded security fund to convert to a cryptocurrency.” The SEC also accused Koski of falsely claiming that the conversion would “allow the fund to recover the face value of $25 as it opens up to a new world of digitized currency.”
 
According to the Commission’s Sept. 1 press release, the SEC has since formally charged Koski with “violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.” The SEC said it is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations.
 
 
Explaining how Koski perpetrated the fraud, the SEC alleged that the Hawaii resident had used internet message boards and different usernames to promote the fake documents. Koski’s objective according to the Commission was to not only boost the price of the security that used the symbol COTRP but bolster the value of his portfolio.
 
To support these allegations, the SEC claimed that after Koski posted a notice in May 2021 stating that the “JCP debentures would be redeemed early at their full value,” the price of the security went up by 75%. According to the SEC, Koski was aware that his statements were false.

The New Architects of On-Chain Finance
Both public and

Picture a

scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, using official government  
websites from various countries to deceive cryptocurrency users. For this

Once redirected to these fake MetaMask sites, users risk losing control over

However, this has turned out to be short-lived as less than two months later, the cryptocurrency has once again succumbed to the bears. This has wiped out its gains after Judge Torres’s ruling and brought it back to pre-judgment levels.
 
Reason Behind The Price Decline
 
In a new report, Kaiko, a crypto market data provider, has revealed the reason behind the XRP price decline so far. The report takes an in-depth look into the activity of XRP holders across different regions and exchanges. This has led to a determination while the price has been on a never-ending downturn.
