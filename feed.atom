A staggering 81.62 Bitcoins, valued at a then-humble $309,000 in 2019, but now a cool $4.2 million. This high-profile case hinges on cutting-edge crypto-tracking technology and raises critical questions about digital asset security in the face of evolving cybercrime tactics.
 
 
From Raid To Riddle
 
The story begins in January 2019, when federal police officers raided a residence suspected of drug activities. Among the recovered items was a Trezor hardware wallet, a secure device housing the seized Bitcoins. After obtaining court authorization, investigators accessed the wallet three weeks later, only to be met with a bewildering sce…]]></summary>
