        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency community is currently on high alert due to the compromise of a prominent admin’s Telegram account. Ragnar Shib, an esteemed administrator in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, recently had his Telegram handle hijacked. The compromised account was used to falsely announce an illegitimate BONE token airdrop.
 
The scam attempted to push a sense of urgency amongst SHIB enthusiasts by stating that the supposed airdrop had a limited supply. The message from the fraudsters read:
 
“The BONE community airdrop wave is now open for claiming. A moment a lot of you have been waiting for! We appreciate the increase in interest and engagement up to this point in Shib’s journey. Holders, followers and builders are all eligible to claim a select amount of BONE, more information below.…]]></summary>

We stood outside a bar where all the drinks were paid for with Bitcoin, and people seemed to be enjoying themselves. At that moment, I stood back, looked around, and observed what was happening. Most of us were far away from home, in a foreign town at almost 1 a.m., yet we only talked about Bitcoin and how we will use it to make the world a better place.

If Recession, Then Not Inflation
Last week, I wrote about the Fed Funds Futures curve, concluding rate cuts will likely start in the middle of next year, giving bitcoin plenty of room to rally through the halving season. That analysis is based on the high probability that a recession is coming, which does not match with the common belief that inflation is heating back up. Today, I want to discuss a couple common paradoxes to clear up that disconnect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears financial services giant Block is closer to going public with its first Bitcoin hardware wallet product.
Teased yesterday by a beta tester, the images offer a first glimpse of Block's new Bitcoin hardware wallet, first announced in 2022, and reveal a small hexagon-shaped device complete with a fingerprint censor, which adds an extra layer of biometric security to the device.
The unveiling comes on the heels of several hints and teasers from Block, the financial services company co-founded by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. 
Block's entry into the hardware wallet market comes at a time when Bitcoin security and self-custody is of paramount importance, as evidenced by the ongoing trial of disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
Bankman-Fried's mismanagement of the exchange contributed to the loss of billions worth of customer crypto, funds that otherwise would have been unaffected had users had control of the private keys for these assets.
In previous reports, Dorsey has hinted at the company's vision for the hardware wallet, emphasizing the importance of allowing customers to maintain full control over their Bitcoin holdings. The device is expected to align with this philosophy, allowing users to securely manage their Bitcoin assets independently. 
To that end, Block's hardware wallet is anticipated to be competitively priced, ensuring that more individuals can participate in the crypto ecosystem without breaking the bank. Hardware wallets today typically retail for between $50 and $100, though prices vary depending on the make and model.



While the initial image of the hardware wallet offers a tantalizing glimpse of what's to come, the Bitcoin community eagerly awaits further details, including its release date, pricing, and additional features. 
Block's venture into the hardware wallet space is poised to make a significant impact, further solidifying the company's position as a key player.]]></summary>

His optimism revolves around the robust functionality and versatility offered by these cryptocurrencies. One of the key advantages Nazarali highlighted for Bitcoin over traditional assets like gold is its ease of transfer.

biography "Going Infinite", Sam Bankman-Fried's initial foray into crypto

In 2017, Bankman-Fried secured an investment of nearly $170  
million from a group of investors who subscribed to the ideology of effective  
altruism. These investors were dedicated to finding ways to make a positive  
impact on society, often through donations or funding noble causes.
Bankman-Fried, a 26-year-old at the time, had ambitious

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin marginally rebounded on Wednesday, after the cryptocurrency collided with a key support point in yesterday’s session. Markets have consolidated Tuesday’s losses, with the global crypto market cap up 0.7% as of writing this. Ethereum remained under the $1,700 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) climbed marginally higher on Wednesday after the price bounced off a recent support point.
 
Following a low of $27,216.00 on Tuesday, BTC/USD surged to a peak of $27,632.90 earlier in the day.
 
The move pushed bitcoin further away from a recent floor of $27,200, and closer to a ceiling at $27,800.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that the rebound comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), bounced from a support level of its own at 58.00.
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is now tracking at 60.52, with the next visible point of resistance at 67.00.
 
Should this upcoming ceiling be broken, then there is a good chance that BTC will re-enter the $28,000 zone.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was largely lower in today’s session, despite moving away from a price floor of its own.
 
ETH/USD has fallen from an earlier peak of $1,662.45, and as of writing this is now trading at $1,648.07.
 
Although the cryptocurrency has moved away from its earlier peak, the price is trading above a floor of $1,620.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This comes as bulls rejected a breakout of the 50.00 level on the RSI indicator, with the index now tracking at 50.63.
 
In the event that momentum begins to pick up in the upcoming days, ethereum could be soon back over $1,700.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new study conducted by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has shed light on the true extent of Bitcoin's impact on cross-border payments, revealing that its significance may be even greater than previously believed. 
According to a report by Reuters, the findings challenge conventional assumptions and underscore the growing relevance of Bitcoin in the global financial landscape. 
Conducted by the organization's test lab, the study sought to comprehensively examine Bitcoin's role in cross-border transactions. While public data often provides a partial view of cryptocurrency activities, this study utilized a novel approach, including the development of a new "global Bitcoin mapping system" that also reportedly incorporates non-public data from private companies.
Details about the proprietary system were not provided by the report. Notably, however, it did acknowledge that its data is likely imperfect given it remains possible to use Bitcoin anonymously and without identification.
The system tracked transactions, addresses, and wallet movements to paint a more complete picture of Bitcoin's cross-border payment activities, the report said.
Moreover, the study revealed that Bitcoin was increasingly being used for remittances, providing a lifeline for individuals in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. Its borderless nature and ease of use made it an attractive option for sending funds across international boundaries. 
The findings of this study are expected to stimulate further discussions among regulators, financial institutions, and policymakers regarding the role of cryptocurrencies in cross-border transactions. 
Founded in the 1930s, the BIS is owned by member central banks, and its primary goal is to "foster international monetary and financial cooperation."
As such, the report demonstrates a continued interest in Bitcoin among global central banks, some who want a stronger regulatory approach to the technology.]]></summary>
