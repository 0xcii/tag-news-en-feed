Why Dogecoin Reaching An $80 Billion Market Cap Isn’t A New ATH
 
Dogecoin community member John Carter explained in an X post that DOGE reaching an $80 billion market won’t mark a new ATH for the meme coin primarily due to its inflationary status. The meme coin has an infinite supply, meaning that more DOGE tokens will keep entering into circulation. 
 
 
This means that Dogecoin’s price will continue to be diluted as long as it doesn’t outpace the rate at which new coins are issued. In this instance, DOGE’s price has already been di…]]></summary>
