Filed yesterday (Thursday), the lawsuit termed the efforts of the regulator a “campaign to seize control over the future of cryptocurrency.”
A Strategic Lawsuit
The lawsuit argued that if the SEC continues to exert its authority over Ethereum, it would bring the blockchain to a halt, “crippling one of the internet’s greatest innovations.”
Consensys revealed that its actions against the SEC followed its receipt of a Wells Notice on April 10, indicating that the regulator is preparing to bring enforcement actions against the company over the services of its MetaMask wallet. The company highli…]]></summary>

In a new post on X, IntoTheBlock discussed a pattern that the total holdings of Bitcoin long-term holders have generally followed during bull markets in the past.
 
The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to investors who have been holding their coins for longer than a year (as defined by IntoTheBlock; other analytics firms use a different cutoff) without having sold or moved them on the blockchain.
 
 
Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell at any point. As such, the LTHs, who hold for significant periods, are …]]></summary>

Is Bitcoin Inside A Wyckoff Re-accumulation Phase?
 
Taking to X, the analyst believes Bitcoin might be forming a Wyckoff Re-accumulation pattern on the daily chart. This means the coin could consolidate in a trading range before catapulting higher in the days ahead.
 
 
Technically, the Wyckoff Re-accumulation pattern identifies a phase when it is assumed that big players, primarily whales, are quietly buying at a discount. Price action remains muted and inside a defined range whenever they do this.
