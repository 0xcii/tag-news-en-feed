        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A worrisome trend has involved Australians losing as much as A$180 million ($122 million) to investment scams related to crypto over the last 12 months, says a recent warning from the Australian Federal Police (AFP).
 
 
The figure represents about half of the A$382 million ($259 million) losses to all investment scams in the 2023-24 financial year, putting into light a growing threat in the digital space of investing.
 
Contrary to general perceptions, the current targets of these scams are really young people. The AFP claims that 60% of scam victims are under 50 years of age. That dispels the myth on how older people are the most vulnerable ones.
 
According to AFP Assistant Commissioner Richard Chin, scammers have now started using sophisticated tactics like “pig butchering” and deepfak…]]></summary>
