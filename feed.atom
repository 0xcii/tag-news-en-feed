This achievement garnered the miner a total of 6.887 BTC, inclusive of the 6.25 BTC subsidy and transaction fees.
 
Solo Miner’s Slim Odds Pay Off: Claims Bitcoin Block Reward With Mere 2 PH/s Hashrate
 

 
Echoing a similar event from the end of October, this miner, also affiliated with Solo Ckpool, successfully mined the block. Ckpool is designed to support independent miners, allowing them to retain the entire block reward, unlike other pools where rewards are shared.
 

 

 

 
Con Kolivas, the developer overseeing Solo Ckpool, remarked that this was the 279th block successfully mined by the pool. He noted the rarity of such an event, stating, “A miner of this size would solve a block on average only once every 5 years,” underscoring the miner’s extraordinary luck in this instance.
 

 

 

 
For context, the Bitcoin network’s total hashpower stands at approximately 488 exahash per second (EH/s), or 488 quintillion hashes per second. In comparison, the solo miner’s contribution of 2 PH/s, or 2 quadrillion hashes, represents a mere 0.0004% of the network’s collective hashpower, highlighting the improbability of their success.

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that aims to maintain a stable value by pegging it to another asset, such as a fiat currency, precious metal, or a basket of assets.

While Bitcoin is known for its price volatility, stablecoins provide a more price stable alternative, making them suitable for various use cases.
One of the most prominent ways stablecoins are marketed is in regards to their ability to act as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset space. By pegging their value to a stable asset, stablecoins provide a reliable medium of exchange and store of value. This sta…]]></summary>

The ten largest deposits to exchanges generally come from whale entities, so this ratio’s value can tell us about how the inflow activity of these humongous investors compares against that of the entire market.
