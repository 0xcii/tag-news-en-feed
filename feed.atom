Since March, the correlation between the alpha crypto and the precious metal has steadily increased, providing investors with a safe haven in the face of the ongoing banking crisis and rising interest rates. 
 
But what exactly is driving this unexpected partnership between Bitcoin and gold, and how long can it last?
 
 
Bitcoin Outshines Gold Amid Banking Crisis
 
As the banking crisis continues to rock the financial world, investors are turning to Bitcoin as a safe haven for their money. In fact, many are choosing the crypto over the traditional safe haven asset, gold, because of its higher returns and increased stability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A top Russian official has urged all countries to make efforts to ensure that the “threat of global confrontation, of a hot, full-scale World War III” does not materialize. “World tensions are white-hot indeed,” he warned.
 
Russian Official: Full-Scale World War III Should Not Materialize
 
The deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, urged all countries to make efforts to avoid the outbreak of a new, full-scale global conflict Tuesday while addressing participants in the Znanie (Knowledge) educational marathon.
 
“I cannot say what the last straw, what the trigger may be. But it may happen at some point,” he was quoted by Russian news outlet Tass as saying. The official emphasized:
 

We all need to work to ensure that this threat of global confrontation, of a hot, full-scale World War III should not materialize.
 
Commenting on the current conflict between Russia and Western countries, he stressed that Russia has no desire to see a war break out.
 
However, he said: “But world tensions are white-hot indeed.”
 
 
Noting that he and his friends “used to talk about confrontation with the United States, about confrontation between the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Alliance,” the Russian official stressed:
 

Back then it seemed like some kind of hypothetical, far-fetched and impossible scenario. But I can’t say that now, however sad this may sound.
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said this week that anti-Russia sanctions will have a detrimental impact on the global economy, with the potential to spark a global economic crisis. To reduce its dependence on the USD after the U.S. seized about $300 billion of its foreign reserves, Russia is pushing for the BRICS to gain global influence. The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are also working on creating a currency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
