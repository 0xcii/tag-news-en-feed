        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The social media platform X has discontinued its non-fungible token (NFT) profile picture service, a feature introduced just last year in January 2022. The crypto community’s response to this move has been notable, with Kraken’s founder, Jesse Powell, labeling it as “a step back for the industry.”
 
Social Media Giant X Drops NFT Profile Service
 

 
Elon Musk’s X social media platform appears to have eliminated its NFT profile feature. Previously, the service enabled X subscribers to use an Ethereum-based NFT as their profile image on X. Back when X was known as Twitter, it began embracing NFTs and bitcoin (BTC) tipping in September 2021. Introduced in January 2022, the NFT profile extension saw an expansion by October 2022, with the social media company unveiling “NFT Tweet Tiles.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple Labs has made a significant move by buying back $285 million worth of shares from early investors and employees, as per two informed sources who spoke to Reuters. This strategic investment, which is a tender offer, has set the company’s valuation at a staggering $11.3 billion.
 
Crunchbase’s data reveals that since 2015, Ripple has amassed $293.8 million in funding across 14 rounds. Intriguingly, investors are capped at selling a maximum of 6% of their stake, shared the anonymous sources.
 
Ripple, a privately-held entity, confirmed the tender offer, elucidating its plan to earmark $500 million for the planned buyback. This amount is intended to facilitate the conversion of restricted stock units into shares, alongside covering related taxes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The term “ultrasound money” has been thrown around quite a bit in the Ethereum (ETH) community, often describing the network’s potential to become a deflationary asset with better tokenomics than Bitcoin (BTC). While some proponents believe this narrative is well-founded, others argue it is overstated and based on overly optimistic assumptions.
 
Is The Ethereum “Ultrasound Money” Narrative Exaggerated?
 
In a post on X, antiprosynthesis.eth, a developer, challenged the “ultrasound money” narrative, arguing that it is often accompanied by jargon that may conceal the reality of Ethereum’s monetary policy. Specifically, the analyst believes the narrative is a bit “overboard” and loaded with “a bunch of pseudo-scientific hocus pocus” that might mislead ordinary users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has insisted that bitcoin doesn’t have value, emphasizing that its use cases are sex trafficking, tax avoidance, money laundering, and terrorism financing. However, JPMorgan has teamed up with Blackrock to help the world’s largest asset manager grow its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) as a lead authorized participant.
 
Jamie Dimon Insists Bitcoin Has No Value
 
The CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, still believes that bitcoin has no value even as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday. In an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday, Dimon expressed:
 

I’ve always said that bitcoin doesn’t have value … The actual use cases are sex trafficking, tax avoidance, money laundering, terrorism financing.
 
The JPMorgan executive’s comment echoed his statement made during a Senate Banking Committee’s hearing in December last year. In response to a question by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Dimon said: I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, etc. You pointed out the true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, anti-money laundering, tax avoidance.” He also said that he would close down crypto if he were the government.
 
Meanwhile, JPMorgan has teamed up with Blackrock as a lead authorized participant for the world’s largest asset manager’s spot bitcoin ETF, the Ishares Bitcoin Trust. JPMorgan is also named as an authorized participant for the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF.
 
Blackrock’s Ishares Bitcoin Trust was among the 11 spot bitcoin ETFs approved by the SEC on Wednesday. The fund will trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol IBIT. The NYSE Arca and the Cboe BZX Exchange will also list and trade some approved spot bitcoin ETFs.
