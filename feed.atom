A new development saw users of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange taking to Twitter to reveal that banks may be taking action against bank accounts linked to FTX.
 
Are Banks Closing FTX-Linked Bank Accounts?
 
The first signs of trouble came when the Head of Operations at Elixir Protocol, Cole Petersen took to Twitter to reveal that his bank had closed his accounts. Petersen attributes the closure to the FTX wire transfers that had been made on the accounts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano fell to an all-time low on Friday, as sentiment in crypto markets remained bearish in today’s session. The token fell for a third consecutive day, with prices moving below a key price floor in the process. Polygon also extended recent declines, hitting a multi-week low as a result. 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) hit an all-time low in today’s session, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remains bearish, following recent economic data.
 
ADA/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.2845 earlier in today’s session, less than a day after trading at $0.3026.
 
Today’s sell-off comes as cardano fell for a third straight session, breaking out of a key support point in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the aforementioned floor is at the $0.3000 mark, which was broken once before, on November 21.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also moved below a floor of 35.50, and as of writing is tracking at 30.91.
 
This is the lowest point the index has hit since October 22, with prices hitting a bottom of $0.3100 on that occasion.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was another notable token to fall today, with prices also moving lower for a third straight day.
 
Following a high of $0.891 on Thursday, MATIC/USD dropped to a bottom of $0.8483 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this drop, polygon moved to its lowest point since November 30, when prices hit a bottom of $0.837
 
 
MATIC has since rebounded from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $0.8569, which is still nearly 4% lower than Thursday’s floor.
 
This slight rebound comes as the RSI rejected a breakout of a point of support at the 43.00 level, and the index is currently at the 44.26 mark.
 
Historically, bulls have used this floor as a point of reentry, and should this reoccur, then we could see MATIC move back towards the $0.90 level.

This is an opinion editorial by Mitchell Askew, a Christian, conservative Bitcoiner who produces Bitcoin-related research and social media content for Blockware Solutions.
“You don’t change Bitcoin, Bitcoin changes you.”
This is one of many mantras circulating around the Bitcoin community. I am two years removed from the start of my Bitcoin journey and can personally attest to the legitimacy of this statement. While my experience in Bitcoin is relatively short-lived, people can grow a great deal in two years, especially those in their early 20s.

Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Continues To Rise, Approaches ATH
 
The “mining hashrate” is an indicator that measures the total amount of computing power currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. When this metric observes a rise, it means miners are bringing more machines online on the network, showing that they are finding the chain attractive right now. On the other hand, a decrease suggests some miners are leaving the blockchain, likely because they are not finding the coin profitable enough to mine at the moment.
 
Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate over the last six months:
