In light of the legal and regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP, Canary’s decision to proceed with this ETF demonstrates a bold approach to the asset’s long-term potential.
 
Canary Capital submitted the S-1 filing Tuesday, which is a requirement for issuers to file to publicly offer new securities.
 
The Canary ETF is particularly ambitious as the legal and regulatory fate of XRP remains shrouded in doubt, indicating a firm conviction in the digital asset’s future role in the finance industry.
