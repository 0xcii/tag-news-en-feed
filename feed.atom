        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A US Supreme Court case has caught the interest of the crypto community, especially the XRP community, as it could significantly impact Ripple’s ongoing legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The US Supreme Court is set to decide on whether or not to overrule the Chevron Deference Doctrine in the ongoing case of Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo. 
 
How The Chevron Deference Doctrine Affects Ripple’s Case
 
The doctrine provides that courts, in the case of ambiguity, could adopt a federal agency’s interpretation of a statute as far as it sounds plausible. This doctrine was formulated in 1984 in the case of Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council when the court reasoned that these agencies, as experts, were in a better position than the court to…]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s Transaction Backlog Nears End as Ordinal Inscriptions Wane
 
A little over a fortnight ago, the clutter in Bitcoin’s mempool was quite pronounced, boasting over 500,000 unconfirmed transactions awaiting miner confirmation. However, a notable decline in Ordinal inscription minting three days ago saw bitcoin miners significantly whittle down the number of unconfirmed transactions to 153,000.
 
Fast forward to today, October 3, 2023, and the scenario has dramatically improved; the miners have managed to further slash the figure to 27,210, hinting that the backlog may soon be a thing …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was a notable mover on Tuesday, as the meme coin extended recent declines after a failed move beyond a key resistance level. The drops came as the wider crypto market cap also slipped. It is trading 2.87% lower as of writing. Shiba inu also edged lower in today’s session.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) fell by as much as 3% on Tuesday, as bearish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets.
 
DOGE/USD dropped to a low of $0.06163 earlier in the day, following a high of $0.06329 the day prior.
 
The decline came as the meme coin failed to move beyond a key resistance level at the $0.0640 level.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the downward pressure came after the relative strength index (RSI) slipped below a floor at 47.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 44.37, with the 40.00 mark a potential target for sellers.
 
Should this point be hit, there is a strong possibility that dogecoin will be trading below the $0.06000 region.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
In addition to DOGE, shiba inu (SHIB) also edged lower today, as prices approached a key support point.
 
Following a high at $0.000007479, SHIB/USD declined to a bottom at $0.000007258 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of this surge, the world’s second largest meme coin closed in on a price floor at the $0.00000710 level.
 
 
Whilst SHIB has not hit this point yet, the RSI has collided with a floor of its own at the 43.00 mark.
 
Currently, the index is tracking marginally below this point at 42.88, however should this downward trend continue, SHIB will almost certainly hit $0.00000710 in the coming days.

To give a little context about the feature, I think it'll be useful to give a little history lesson. When a Bitcoin Core node first turns on and starts syncing the blockchain it doesn't actually validate the entire historical chain. It can, but it doesn't by default, the reason being to save time and resources when bootstrapping.

These exchange-traded funds were designed to track futures contracts linked to the value of Ethereum’s native currency, Ether. 
 
However, the initial trading activity suggests that market enthusiasm did not translate into significant investment dollars, especially when compared to the launch of their Bitcoin counterparts.
 
 
Mixed Results For Ether ETFs 
 
Of the nine ETF products introduced, five exclusively hold Ether futures contracts, while the remaining four combine both Bitcoin and ETH futures. While these ETFs entered the market with high expectations, the first day of trading saw relatively subdued volume.
