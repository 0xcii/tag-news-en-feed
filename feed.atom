        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vanguard, a major player in the investment management industry with over $7 trillion in assets, has taken a surprising stance by blocking customer access to Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), according to multiple reports. The move comes as a notable deviation from the growing trend of institutional interest and adoption of Bitcoin-related financial products.



Vanguard says it has no plans to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs or crypto related products, reported The Block. The firm citied that the high volatility nature of Bitcoin goes against the company's goal of helping investors get 'real returns' over the long term.
Reports from clients are stating that while they can not purchase the newly listed spot ETFs, they can however sell shares of GBTC, Grayscale's spot Bitcoin ETF. One client reportedly spoke with a company representative, who stated, "Currently we aren't allowing those to be purchased as it doesn't fit with Vanguard's investment philosophy."
Vanguard's decision to restrict customer access comes just a day after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs for the first time, which have seen over $2.3 billion in trading volume on launch day. It remains to be seen whether the renowned asset manager will backtrack on their stance, and allow customers to participate in the burgeoning Bitcoin market.]]></summary>

However, in a dramatic turn of events later that afternoon, bitcoin’s spot markets experienced a steep decline, with prices falling below the $46,000 mark following a short-lived ascent to $49,000.
 
Bitcoin Reaches $49K High Before Dropping, as ETFs Record $2.3B in Trades by Mid-Day
 
Earlier in the day, at approximately 9 a.m. (ET), bitcoin (BTC) reached a peak value of $49,048 on Bitstamp. This surge to the $49K level was short-lived, as BTC’s value plummeted, dropping beneath the $46K barrier to a low of $45,700 per unit. Shortly after 11 a.m. (ET), Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, revealed that the new spot bitc…]]></summary>

Ethereum Classic Takes Off Following Bitcoin ETF Decision
 
The US SEC has finally approved all the Bitcoin spot ETFs and so far, the event hasn’t proven to be a sell-the-news one, as the market has reacted rather positively to it, with coins across the sector shooting up.
 
 
One asset that has immediately stood out even among these flying altcoins has been Ethereum Classic. ETC is a hard fork of Ethereum and its main aim has been to preserve how the ETH blockchain originally was.
 
Unlike Ethereum, which has transitioned toward a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, Ethereum Classic is still operating on proof-of-work (PoW). The latter mec…]]></summary>
