The ecosystem now has 30 celebrity-themed tokens that reflect famous people from different fields, such as social media influencers, singers, and reality TV stars.
 
Even though these launches got a lot of attention, they didn’t live up to the hype; soon after they came out, the prices of a number of tokens dropped significantly.
 
 
Are Solana Meme Coins Dead?
 
Solana network statistics indicated that celebrity-backed meme coins dropped 94% in their first month. Around 50% of these tokens lost 99% of their value from their peak prices. This shows how speculative meme currencies are, especially ones that rely on celebrity supporters for investment.

Specifically, market experts have questioned if the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, will file for spot ETFs for other altcoins like Solana and XRP.
 
BlackRock Unlikely To File For Spot ETFs For Solana And XRP
 
BlackRock will unlikely file for spot ETFs for Solana and XRP anytime soon. This is based on BlackRock’s digital assets head, Robert Mitchnick, who stated that the asset manager sees “very little interest” in crypto beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This suggests that BlackRock will likely just stick with its Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs rather than pursue offering any other crypto ETF.
