Pioneers of zero-knowledge systems, the group has revealed plans to leverage OP_CAT in order to bring their STARK technology to Bitcoin. The soft fork proposal could allow zero-knowledge proofs to be verified natively, opening up an entirely new design space for developers.

NEW: 🇺🇸 #Bitcoin ETFs saw $886 million in inflows yesterday, the 16th straight day of inflows. 
We are so back 🙌 pic.twitter.com/Er2KDgXr9E
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 5, 2024
  
  
  
The ETFs have now seen 16 straight days of inflows, sparking talk of a "second wave" of demand. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund led inflows with $378.7 million, followed by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust at $274.4 million.
In total, the spot Bitcoin ETFs hold over $60 billion worth of BTC. Analysts cite renewed institutional interest and Bitcoin's price resurgence back above $70,000 as drivers of the latest wave of inflows.
It's the highest daily intake for the funds since March 12, when they took in a record $1.04 billion. The next day, Bitcoin went on to hit an all-time high of $73,679, showing the potential impact of the inflows.
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust also saw a rare inflow day of $28.2 million, just the seventh since converting to a spot ETF in January. It joins the renewed enthusiasm despite bleeding funds for most of the year.
With major firms like Fidelity and BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETFs now holding tens of billions in assets, the infrastructure for institutional Bitcoin investment continues maturing.
The latest inflow wave follows Australia, the U.K., and Thailand's recent approval and listing of Bitcoin-regulated funds. With the regulatory climate warming worldwide, Bitcoin ETFs are attracting capital once again.]]></summary>

Leading the charge is Coinbase, the popular US-based crypto exchange, which has donated a whopping $25 million in USDC to the Fairshake Super PAC. This marks Coinbase’s second major contribution to the advocacy group, which aims to promote pro-crypto candidates.
 
 
According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the urgency to support Fairshake’s “stand with crypto” initiative is vital to counter the growing opposition to digital assets among some congressional leaders.
 
In a recent announcement, Armstrong said:
 
 
“The best way to get regulatory clarity in democratic countries is to elect pro-crypto candidates on both sides of the aisle and to vote anti-crypto candidates out of office.”
