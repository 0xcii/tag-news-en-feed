According to key data from Glassnode, US spot ETFs currently hold 4.6% of the total Bitcoin supply, translating to an impressive valuation of approximately $58 billion. This growing presence of institutional capital not only adds credibility to BTC but also suggests a potential for increased price stability and upward momentum.
