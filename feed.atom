scathing critique of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) strategy  
for regulating digital assets, characterizing it as fundamentally flawed and  
harmful to the US economy. Reed, a former SEC employee, has articulated his  
concerns in a strongly worded op-ed for Fortune, pointing out the agency's  
departure from core principles such as transparency, fairness, and stable  
regulation in its management of the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.

Stablecoin Market Cap Has Enjoyed Some Notable Growth Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the aggregate supply of stablecoins has been going through an expansion since October of last year.
 
The relevant indicator here is the “aggregated market cap net position change,” which keeps track of the monthly changes happening in the total stablecoin supply (or market cap, as they are equivalent in the case of these assets tied to the USD).
 
 
When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the supply of the stables has gone up during the last 30 days. On the other hand, negative values imply a decline has…]]></summary>

Morgan stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “nothing prevents Ripple” from selling its XRP tokens. He highlighted how anyone, including the crypto firm, can sell assets that they own.

The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with speculation about the duration of this downturn, especially as the excitement surrounding the spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) begins to wane.
 
Bitcoin
 
The bitcoin daily chart as of Jan. 19, 2024, depicts a predominantly downward trajectory. This shift from a peak near $49,048 to a more recent low close to $36,727 marks notable market volatility. The chart reflects a series of rises and falls, pointing to a market fraught with uncertainty. Although there has been a recent uptick, suggesting a slight recovery, it’s too early to determine if this is just a brief respite or the start of a significant market shift.
