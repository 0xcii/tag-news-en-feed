The bill is being reintroduced in advance of a hearing on the environmental impact of crypto mining scheduled for Tuesday.
 
 
Crypto Mining Bill To Mandate Study On Emissions Impact
 
First proposed in December, the Crypto-Asset Environmental Transparency Act would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to investigate the effects of large-scale crypto mining operations on global warming.
 
The study would cost $5 million, and its results would be made public within 18 months of the bill’s approval.
 
 
The miners would also be obligated to provide their…]]></summary>

This is an opinion editorial by Jared Nusinoff, the founder and CEO of Mash, a Bitcoin- and Lightning-Network-based micropayments platform.

I’m sick and tired of hearing about Nick Szabo’s “Micropayments And Mental Transaction Costs” post from 1999.
When talking about micropayments, there are many doubters and detractors. For them, micropayments is a “dirty word.” They almost always reference the “failed” attempts related to creating a digital currency akin to bitcoin — like the eCash payment system by David Chaum’s Digicash in the ’80’s and ’90s. Yes, it failed. But that’s not about micropayments.

One of the past legal issues with Tether was when New York banned it from operating in the state. The Office of the New York State Attorney General investigated the firm in 2018 for giving out loans to investors and offering unregistered securities. 
 
 
Some of these issues then placed Tether and its sister company Bitfinex in a difficult position as they could no longer access banking services. The firms allegedly falsified documents for support and even presented shell companies to confuse the banks.
