Ripple Takes Bold Step With Stay Request
 
On Wednesday, the Ripple team in a letter filed a demand for a stay of the monetary portion, particularly the $125 million fine of the court’s previous judgment.

Translated, this is about $3 billion, showing how big the industry has grown. As the country solidifies its status as the world’s second-largest crypto miner, after the United States, the landscape is changing at a really rapid pace.
