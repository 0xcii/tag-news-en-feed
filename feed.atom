Miners Withdrawing From BCH Reserves Spell Bearish Trend
 
It was reported last month that trading activity of the altcoin surged on various crypto exchanges, leading to a surge of over 200% in price. As a consequence of this, miners flocked to the blockchain in an effort to capitalize on the price increase.
 
 
However, the price of Bitcoin Cash has fallen by 28% since then, and the miner euphoria has been plateauing. According to recent data from IntoTheBlock, miners have been withdrawing BCH from mi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brian Korn, a partner at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips LLP, a Los Angeles-based law firm of more than 450 attorneys, has introduced a thought-provoking argument regarding the legal battle between SEC v. Ripple that could have far-reaching consequences for the broader crypto industry’s secondary market.
 
The ruling, which was rendered on July 13, carried some intriguing implications for the entire crypto market. While Judge Torres explicitly said in a footnote that she is not addressing whether all secondary trading in XRP is covered by federal securities law because that question was not presented in the SEC’s case, she classified institutional XRP sales as investment contracts and excluded programmatic sales from this category.
