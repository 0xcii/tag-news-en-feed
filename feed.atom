‘Why Now?’—Binance Hits Back at SEC’s TRO Bid, Questions Timing and Urgency
 

 
Approximately a week ago, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a move to secure a court’s approval in order to freeze the assets of Binance US, the United States subsidiary of Binance. The SEC’s aim behind filing for a temporary restraining order was to safeguard customer assets, as stated in their request. However, Binance responded on June 12 by opposing the TRO request and a…]]></summary>

What Is Polygon 2.0?
 
Polygon’s official statement reads, “Polygon 2.0 is a network of ZK-powered layer-2 chains unified via a novel cross-chain coordination protocol. The entire network will feel like using a single chain for a user.”
 
The primary objective behind building Polygon 2.0 is to enable secure and instantaneous cross-chain interoperability among off-chain networks, most of which are built on Ethereum, the world’s largest smart contract platform.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, three ADA metrics had surged to the highest level for 2023 when the price hit the $0.23 low. The first of these metrics is the “trading volume,” which measures the total amount of Cardano that’s being moved around on the blockchain every day by the users.
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that a large number of tokens of the asset are being transacted on the network right now. Such a trend can be a sign that traders are active in the sector currently.
