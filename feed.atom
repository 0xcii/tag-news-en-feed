        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu surged to a multi-month high on Wednesday, as the meme coin collided with a key price ceiling. Prices rose by as much as 17% in today’s session, as the global cryptocurrency market cap also trended higher. Polkadot was once again in the green, with the token hovering close to a two-month high of its own. 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) rallied on Wednesday, as the meme coin surged to a two-month high, following declines on Tuesday.
 
Following a low of $0.00001053, SHIB/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.00001289 earlier in today’s session.
 
Today’s move saw shiba inu climb to its strongest point since early November, when prices last collided with a ceiling at the $0.00001290 level.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rebounded from a support point at 76.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at a level of 80.31, which is deep in overbought territory.
 
Earlier gains have also been wiped out, and the meme coin is currently trading at $0.0000124.
 
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) continued to trade near a two-month high, as the token remained near a key resistance level.
 
DOT/USD jumped to a high of $6.19 earlier in the day, before selling off following the release of U.S. retail sales figures.
 
Sales in the world’s largest economy fell by 1.1% in December, more than the decline of 0.8% many had expected.
 
 
As a result of the news, earlier gains have now been erased, with the price currently trading at $5.69.
 
The RSI has also given way, with price strength falling below a floor of 70.00, and currently tracking at 64.25.
 
Should this reversal worsen, DOT could be heading to a floor of $5.00.

With the crypto market seeing a significant recovery over the last week, all of the altcoins have followed suit. However, the meme coins have been significantly better recently as they have continued to see high gains at a time when the rest of the market is falling back.
 
Dogecoin, Shiba Inu See Gains
 
Although it cannot be said that meme coin season is back in full swing, the gains being recorded by the meme coins is a good indicator that they remain a formidable force in the sector. In the last 24 hours, most of the market has followed the footsteps of bitcoin and is now trading sideways, but coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are still in good standing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu has surpassed its previous barriers with a massive 20% price surge in the last 24 hours. Although SHIB’s price has been on a steady rise since January, this latest rally was a rather unforeseen performance.
 
After the successful rally, the burn rate on the SHIB network spiked to 613%. Shibburn, a platform that tracks burned SHIB tokens, confirmed the burn of more than 70 million SHIB tokens since the out-of-the-blue price rally in the market.
 
Possible Reasons For Increased SHIB Token Burn And Price Surge
 
Given the increased activity in the market, SHIB whales and long-term retail addresses have been actively moving funds. The increased whale activities led to a spike in the network activity, which might explain why so many SHIB tokens were burned.

Without much warning, the crypto winter swept off lots of funds as the value of most crypto assets plummeted. Subsequently, many companies drowned in the storm of chaos and filed for bankruptcy.
 
Vauld was among the firms impacted by the chain of events of last year. The crypto lending firm struggled following this leading to its suspension of withdrawals on the platform. It later filed for protection from its Singaporean creditors.
 
 
Vauld was previously granted three-month protection by its creditors, but a Singapore court has now extended the creditor protection period for Vauld. According to Bloomberg’s report, the court gave Vauld till February 28, 2023, to devise a revival plan on …]]></summary>

As you might have learned from watching the mainstream news, the bitcoin price has been pumping as of late. If you bought the top and held until now, you may consider taking advice from good ol’ Mr. Goldshill himself, Peter Schiff, and use this opportunity to sell. If you’re someone who missed the boat, though, you may reasonably wait for confirmation and buy closer to $70,000. For those thinking to make a quick buck, you might hop on for a ride just to try and cash out near the next all-time high. If you’re a Communist wh…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-01-18T13:38:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose to its highest level since September, as markets prepared for the release of U.S. retail sales data. This afternoon’s economic release is expected to show a cooling off of sales, as consumers prepare for a recession. Ethereum also rose on the news, as it continued to hover close to $1,600. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rose above a key resistance level at $21,400 in today’s session, hitting a fresh multi-month high in the process.
 
Following a low of $21,120.16, BTC/USD raced to a peak of $21,438.66 in the early hours of Wednesday’s session.
 
This surge in price saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency climb to its strongest point since September 13.
 
 
The move comes as markets prepare for the release of U.S. retail sales figures, which are expected to decline to -0.8%, from -0.6%.
 
From the chart, price strength continues to hover in overbought territory, with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) tracking at 87.92.
 
The next visible point of resistance is at the 90.00 mark, which could pose a challenge for longer-term bulls.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also moved marginally higher on Wednesday, as it continued to trade near a ceiling of $1,600.
 
ETH/USD jumped to a high of $1,594.00 on hump day, less than 24-hours after falling to a bottom of $1,562.06.
 
Today’s gain in price now means that ethereum has climbed higher for ten of the last eleven sessions.
 
 
As of writing, the 14-day RSI is tracking at 84.18, which like bitcoin, is deep in overbought territory.
 
Looking at the chart, the last time ETH traded at this point in early November, it was followed by a significant drop in price.
 
Many technical traders will likely pay attention to this, and a fear of history repeating itself could lead to many liquidating current positions.
