This is due to the fourth of July Independence Day celebrations, which will see some markets in the United States closed.

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was once again in consolidation, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency remained below a key resistance level for a third straight day.
 
BTC/USD moved to a peak at $30,789.11 earlier in the day, less than 24-hours after nearing a drop below $30,000.
