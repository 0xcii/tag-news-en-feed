        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former US President Donald Trump has found himself at the epicenter of a cryptocurrency-fueled windfall.
 
Data from market intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence reveals that Trump’s cryptocurrency portfolio has surged by a staggering 4,000% – a gain largely driven by the meteoric rise of the “Save America” meme coin, affectionately dubbed “TRUMP.”
 
 
According to the report, Trump’s affiliated crypto wallet has been the recipient of multiple airdrops of the TRUMP token, the latest of which occurred just 30 minutes prior to the analysis.
 
These generous airdrops have propelled the wallet’s value from a modest $7.4 million to a staggering $9 million in a single day, with the TRUMP meme coin alone accounting for a remarkable $1.30 million of that increase.

Bitcoin has for most of its lifetime been seen as a monetary network, whereby users can send and receive the native token BTC. Given the tremendous price appreciation since its inception in 2009, the monetary good also became a store of value — a means through which someone could store their valuable work hours so as to not have them debased and instead experience an increase of purchasing power rather than a loss.
Not all users are alike, however. Despite the popularity of these monetary narratives, some outcasts have used Bitcoin for all kinds of purposes throughout time. Most notably, Julian Assange, a now-famous journalist and political prisoner, creator …]]></summary>

The potential approval of such an ETF is poised to bring profound changes to Ethereum’s market dynamics.
 
The Case For A Spot ETH ETF Approval
 
The report delves into the critical importance of a spot ETH ETF, drawing parallels with the successful approval of spot BTC ETFs in the US. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has provided regulatory clarity and attracted significant capital inflows, reinforcing Bitcoin’s status as a macro asset. Similarly, a spot ETF would open Ethereum to the same capital pools that currently favor Bitcoin, fundamentally altering investm…]]></summary>

Crypto Influencers: The Impact Of Tweets
 
The research, conducted by a team at leading universities, analyzed the impact of tweets from over 180 crypto influencers on follower behavior and token prices.
 
The results paint a concerning picture. While tweets were found to trigger short-term price increases, averaging nearly 2% within the first two days, these gains quickly evaporated. In fact, the study found a cumulative return drop of nearly 7% within a month of influencer endorsements.
