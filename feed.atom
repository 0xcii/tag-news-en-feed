        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a period of relative calm in recent days, characterized by low price volatility leading up to a 6% increase in the last 24 hours. The phase has been mostly characterized by low price volatility despite huge movements on-chain. 
 
 
Interestingly, it seems the trend has sparked an increase in SHIB accumulation among some large holders. As such, the accumulation has sparked theories of the return of a bullish upside for SHIB, which could mimic a rally witnessed in February. 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently been defined by significant whale transactions, underscoring the heightened activity among large holders. A prime example is the recent withdrawal of $1 million worth of SHIB from the crypto exchange Robinhood by the prominent market maker Wintermute.
