        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The exchange giant is joining Fidelity and BNY Mellon in the pursuit of their own cryptocurrency custody platform.
 
         
         
         
         
    
Nasdaq, an American stock exchange based in New York City, is reportedly looking at Q2 2023 for the release of its custody services for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 
In an interview with Bloomberg, Senior Vice President and Head of Nasdaq Digital Assets Ira Auerbach said that Nasdaq “is pushing ahead to get all the necessary technical infrastructure and regulatory approvals in place.” 
The report describes an infrastructure that might look similar to that of Fidelity Digital Assets, which quietly opened its operations to the public last week. The first step to bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading on Nasdaq would be the custody service for the assets.
According to the Bloomberg report, “Nasdaq has applied to the New York Department of Financial Services for a limited-purpose trust company charter, which would oversee the new business.”
Launching just as several major cryptocurrency firms have collapsed, amidst increasing regulatory tension, the goal is seemingly to offer those customers who now have no platform, a regulated, well-trusted American service for bitcoin. 
It should be noted that many of the issues surrounding exchanges come from the third-party risks presented by a custodian holding bitcoin for customers. The most secure way to interact with bitcoin is to self-custody it with your own wallet. Although trading platforms do offer the ease of interaction created by custodianship, with the American financial system seeing precarious headlines as of late, it is important to consider these trade offs compared with traditional bitcoin self-custody.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monero jumped to a one-month high on Friday, as overall sentiment in crypto markets remained largely unchanged. The global market cap is now trading 0.60% higher at the time of writing. Xrp was back in the red in today’s session, as traders continued to secure recent gains.
 
Monero (XMR)
 
Monero (XMR) has been one of today’s biggest gainers, with prices climbing to a four-week high.
 
Following a low of $152.16 on Thursday, XMR/USD raced to a peak of $163.10 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, XMR climbed to its strongest point since February 20, when the token reached a peak of $168.70.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came as monero rose beyond a key resistance level at the $155.00 mark.
 
Earlier momentum has somewhat eased, which comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a ceiling at 58.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 58.84, with XMR marginally lower than its earlier high. It is now trading at $160.65.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, extended declines on Friday, as traders continued to secure profits following recent highs.
 
XRP/USD dropped to a bottom of $0.4246 in today’s session, which comes a day after a peak at $0.4536.
 
Today’s drop comes three days after XRP hit a peak at $0.4940, which was its strongest point since last November.
 
 
This latest decline comes as the RSI fell below a ceiling at the 64.00 mark, and is now tracking at 57.31.
 
Despite the slip in sentiment, bulls rejected a breakout from a floor of $0.4250, with XRP now trading at $0.4264.
 
There will likely be another attempt to push prices under this mark, however should this point of support hold, there could be a reversal during the weekend.
