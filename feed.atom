Staking allows Ethereum holders to earn yield on their holdings, a feature of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. Ethereum holders need to lock in their holdings for a set period to support the blockchain operations in exchange for the reward.

FIT21: Bipartisan Support, But Hurdles Remain
 
FIT21 received a boost from an unlikely source – former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In a move defying expectations, Pelosi championed the bill, calling it a “first step” towards regulating the burgeoning crypto space. This bipartisan support, with 71 Democrats joining forces with 208 Republicans, marks a historic moment for the industry.
