        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/bitflyer-takes-the-reins-acquiring-ftx-japan-amid-bankruptcy-fallout/"/>
        <updated>2024-06-20T16:04:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today (Thursday), it was disclosed that Bitflyer, a Japanese  
cryptocurrency exchange, has acquired the Japanese operations of FTX, which had  
previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2022. FTX  
Japan was among over 100 affiliated entities included in the bankruptcy  
proceedings.
Asset Segregation Raises Recovery Hopes
In contrast to its parent company, FTX Japan reported having  
more assets than liabilities, with approximately $134 million in user assets  
segregated from FTX Trading. This distinction raised hopes for the potential  
recovery of funds belonging to Japanese customers.
Bitcoin.com News reported over a year and five months ago  
that FTX Japan customers would gradually be allowed to withdraw their assets.  
Founded by Yuzo Kano, a former Goldman Sachs trader, Bitflyer is a  
well-established cryptocurrency exchange in Japan, having received a license  
from the Japanese Financial Services Agency in September 2017.

Just-In: BitFlyer Exchange Plans To Acquire FTX Japan https://t.co/W00Wq9XkmB
— Crypto Mak (@crypto__mak) June 20, 2024
According to NHK, Bitflyer is set to acquire all shares of  
FTX Japan, valuing the subsidiary in the range of several billion yen. As of  
the latest update, Bitflyer has reported a 24-hour trade volume of  
approximately $73.11 million, prominently driven by BTC/JPY transactions. It  
currently ranks 22nd among global exchanges by trading volume as of Today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin miners, the backbone of the world’s largest cryptocurrency, are experiencing a dramatic shift in their behavior. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a surprising trend: miner reserves have sunk to their lowest level in 14 years, raising concerns about the future of Bitcoin mining. However, a closer look suggests this might be a case of shrewd adaptation rather than a mass exodus.
 
 
Halving Headaches: Balancing Rewards And Risk
 
The culprit behind this shift is the recent Bitcoin halving event in April 2024. Roughly every four years, the number of Bitcoins awarded to miners for validating transactions is cut in half. This time around, the reward dropped from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. While this might seem like a minor decrease, it significantly impacts miner profitability.

According to Maradiaga, the Nicaraguan people are losing their freedoms at an alarming rate.
“According to the Freedom in the World report, we have the very unfortunate label of being the country that over the last year has lost the most freedoms,” Maradiaga told Bitcoin Magazine.
“Imagine a country in which you could go to prison for raising the national flag, for tweeting, for receiving a remittance from an international donor or for expressing your opinions on social media,” he added.
“That's the situation in Nicaragua.”

NEW: VanEck's spot #Bitcoin ETF officially went live on Australia's largest stock exchange 🇦🇺 pic.twitter.com/m0gehtEd70
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 20, 2024
  
  
  
"ASX welcomes VBTC to the exchange!" announced ASX. "Congratulations to the VanEck Australia team for launching the first crypto ETF on ASX." 
The launch of VanEck's Bitcoin ETF on ASX offers a more accessible option for investors who prefer traditional stock exchanges over crypto exchanges. This ETF, which carries a management fee of 0.59%, allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the BTC, thereby reducing the complexities and risks associated with direct ownership.
"While it has been possible to trade Bitcoin via crypto exchanges, trading units with exposure to Bitcoin via an ETF on an exchange like ASX means you’re able to buy and sell those units through a traditional brokerage account, simplifying the process and opening the opportunity to more Australians," said Andrew Campion, ASX's general manager of investment products and strategy.
Earlier this month, the Monochrome Asset Management's Bitcoin ETF began trading on the Cboe Australia exchange, which has so far purchased over 54 bitcoin worth $5.3 million AUD.

The voting, which allows ADA holders to select three new members for the ICC, is conducted through the Summon Platform and will conclude on June 23, covering Epochs 491 and 492.
 
The ICC plays a crucial role during the technical bootstrapping phase of the Chang hard fork, tasked with upholding the interim constitution and ensuring that Governance Actions align with its mandates. The election results are set to be announced on June 26.
