As noted by Spot On Chain, the majority of these tokens were sent to crypto exchange Binance, prompting speculation as to whether this could cascade into a dip in the price of Chainlink. These speculations have been further escalated, considering that Chainlink hasn’t been left behind in the wider market decline and is currently on an 8% decline in the past seven days.

This index considers the data of five factors to determine this sentiment: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends.
 
To represent the sentiment, the indicator uses a scale that runs from zero to a hundred. All values below the 47 mark suggest the presence of fear among the investors, while those above 53 signify greed in the market.
