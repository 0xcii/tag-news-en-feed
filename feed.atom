        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elon Musk, the self-acclaimed “Dogefather,” has asked a US Judge to dismiss a $258 billion lawsuit filed against him in 2022. The lawsuit accuses Musk of manipulating the price of Dogecoin in a Ponzi-like manner leading investors to lose money on their investments. 
 
Musk denies this and has filed for the court to dismiss the complaint. His lawyers, in the filing, noted that the lawsuit is a ‘’fanciful work of fiction’’ over his innocent and often silly tweets about Dogecoin. They further stated that the plaintiff never explained how Musk intended to defraud anyone with his tweets and that statements like ‘’no highs, no lows, only Doge’’ were insufficient to support fraud claims.
