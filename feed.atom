In the second part of our discussion with Dr Gabbay, an expert in financial regulation and enforcement, we learn about differing crypto approaches in the EU, whether crypto firms are still willing to do business in the US, the need for bridges between the crypto industry and traditional finance, also touching on political influence and the likelihood of approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs.
