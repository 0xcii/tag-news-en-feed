        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, Katherine Dowling, Chief Communications Officer (CCO) at Bitwise Asset Management, discussed the firm’s spot Ethereum ETF (exchange-traded fund) application and the possibility of new crypto-related products being approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
 
Ethereum ETFs Close To Launch
 
Katherine Dowling joined Bloomberg Crypto to discuss the progress of Bitwise’s spot Ethereum ETF application. According to the crypto fund’s CCO, the applications are advancing smoothly, with issuers seeing “fewer and fewer issues” in the S-1 amendments.
 

 
 
This suggests that “we are close to the finish line on the launch.” Dowling stated “It’s been a long, hot summer for the issuers” waiting for the launch of the Ethereum ETFs as the applicants don’t have a date yet.

Large Shiba Inu Exchange Wallets Have Been Losing Supply Recently
 
In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed the trend forming in the holdings of the Shiba Inu whales. The analytics firm has divided these humongous holders into two cohorts: exchange whales and non-exchange whales.
 
The exchange whales refer to the 150 largest wallets on the network that are affiliated with a centralized exchange. Similarly, the non-exchange whales are the top 150 self-custodial wallets.
 
 
Below is the chart shared by Santiment, which shows how the total supply held by these groups has changed over the last few months.

Kang mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that meme coins probably account for most of the coins that have a chance of making new highs. He added that market participants must be quite selective, seeing as hundreds of meme coins exist. Kang provided this bullish outlook for meme coins while stating that he believes over 98% of altcoins have topped this cycle and that only a handful of coins may make some new highs by the end of this year.
