        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/avalanche-sees-surge-in-btc-bridged-to-its-network-with-over-44-million-in-bitcoin-ported-on-thursday/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-03T20:02:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to statistics, the number of bitcoin bridged to the Avalanche blockchain saw a significant inflow on March 2, as more than 2,000 bitcoin were bridged on that day. Data further shows that as of Friday, March 3, a total of 8,504 bitcoin worth $190.9 million was bridged over to the Avalanche network.
 
Bitcoin Bridged to Avalanche Rises
 
Thirty-eight days ago, Bitcoin.com News reported that the number of bitcoin (BTC) ported over to the Avalanche network had surpassed the capacity of the Lightning Network. On Thursday, a significant amount of bitcoin was moved to Avalanche (AVAX) in the form of Avalanche bridged bitcoin, also known as BTCb.
 
Statistics from Dune Analytics show that more than 2,000 BTC, or roughly $44.7 million worth of bitcoin, was bridged to the AVAX chain. Since our report on January 24, 2023, the number of BTCb has risen 62%, from 5,248 to 8,504 BTCb.
 

 
The BTCb supply is still greater than the number of bitcoin contained in public Lightning Network channels, which is 5,421.50 BTC at the time of writing. Over the 38 days since BTCb surpassed the total on public channels, its supply has grown 38% larger than the Lightning Network capacity.
 
 
To date, BTCb has seen 367,392 transfers, and the bridged bitcoins are held by 4,420 unique addresses. A large number of BTCb are stored on the decentralized finance protocols Benqi and GMX. Onchain data recorded on March 3 shows that 1,317 BTCb are stored within the GMX Vault.
 
Although BTCb has outpaced capacity held on platforms such as the Lightning Network, Blockstream’s Liquid, and RSK’s sidechain, its supply still has some ground to cover to catch up to WBTC and the Binance Smart Chain-issued BEP20 token BTCB. As of the time of writing, there are 53,023 BTCB in circulation and 153,164 WBTC in circulation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin dropped to its lowest level since January, as a red wave swept through cryptocurrency markets. The Silvergate bank based sell-off has impacted overall sentiment, with the global crypto market cap down 3.63% as of writing. Shiba inu also dropped, falling to a six-week low.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped to a multi-month low on Friday, as the Silvergate based sell-off has impacted overall sentiment in the marketplace.
 
Following a high of $0.08084 on Thursday, DOGE/USD fell to an intraday bottom at $0.07424 earlier today.
 
This sell-off has pushed the meme coin to its lowest point since January 9, and below a key support point in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, dogecoin briefly broke out of a floor at $0.0755, which came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also fell below its own support.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 34.80, which is a historically stable floor at the 40.00 mark.
 
Earlier declines have somewhat eased, and DOGE is trading at $0.07589 at the time of writing.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Additionally, shiba inu (SHIB) was another meme coin to edge lower in today’s session, falling to a six-week low in the process.
 
SHIB/USD slipped to a bottom at $0.00001104 on Friday, following Thursday’s peak at $0.00001219.
 
As a result, shiba inu fell below a floor at $0.00001130, hitting its weakest point since January 25 in the process.
 
 
Overall, SHIB is down 14% in the last seven days, which has resulted in the RSI falling to a two-month low.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 38.30, which is in bearish and oversold territory, and is its lowest reading since January 1.
 
Like with DOGE, bears have seemingly begun taking profits, which has resulted in a slight rebound from earlier lows.
