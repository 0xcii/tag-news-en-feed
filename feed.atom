        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e7474e62e2f</id>
        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-fear-and-greed-index-hits-near-extreme-fear-a-buying-opportunity"/>
        <updated>2024-08-05T20:51:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest data from Bitcoin Magazine Pro's Fear and Greed Index reveals that Bitcoin sentiment has dropped to a near "extreme fear" level, scoring 26 out of 100. Historically, such a low score suggests a potential buying opportunity for savvy investors, as market sentiment indicates undervaluation and widespread caution.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
The Fear and Greed Index is a tool for assessing market sentiment, analyzing factors like volatility, momentum, social media trends, and Bitcoin's dominance over other cryptocurrencies. To help investors gauge when to buy or sell Bitcoin, the index ranges from:
0-24: Extreme fear (red)
25-46: Fear (amber)
46-49: Neutral (yellow)
50-74: Greed (light green)
75-100: Extreme greed (green)
Bitcoin's current score of 26 reflects heightened market anxiety, coinciding with a recent -25% price drop for Bitcoin this week. Despite this, historical trends suggest that periods of extreme fear often precede price rebounds, making it an opportune moment for strategic investments. The index has been a reliable indicator, showing that excessive fear typically signals undervalued conditions, whereas extreme greed may indicate overvaluation.
The consistent tracking of fear and greed levels can potentially provide valuable insights, allowing investors to navigate the volatile Bitcoin market more effectively. As the Bitcoin market continues to evolve, tools like the Fear and Greed Index remain essential for understanding market dynamics and making informed investment choices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An extraordinary reveal: Mining was never banned in China.
Yes, you read that right. In fact, not only was it not banned, but Chinese miners are leading the world in innovative uses of Bitcoin mining.
But what of this Reuters report and others that says it was banned?
Let’s have a closer look.
Yes, network hashrate dropped from 179.2 EH/s to 87.7 EH/s (a 51.1% drop) seemingly confirming that China banned mining.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
After all, China was according to Cambridge 46% of global hashrate the month prior to the “ban” (April 2021). So the figures roughly tally up with the thesis that “mining has been banned in China.”
