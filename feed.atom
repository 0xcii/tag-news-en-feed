        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was once again trading below $28,000, as markets consolidated ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls report. Payrolls are expected to come in at 240,000 for last month, with the unemployment rate in the U.S. remaining at 3.6%. Ethereum was also lower today, following an eight-month high on Wednesday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was once again trading under $28,000 on Thursday, as markets began to prepare for tomorrow’s non-farm payrolls report.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,831.56 in today’s session, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $28,714.22.
 
The move came as bitcoin bulls were unable to sustain a breakout of a key resistance level of $28,500.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this latest drop in price came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) dropped below a floor of 58.00.
 
As of writing this, the index is now tracking at 57.80, with the 10-day (red) moving average nearing a downwards cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should sentiment remain bearish, there is a strong possibility that BTC will fall to a floor at $27,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also lower in today’s session, as prices slipped from an eight-month high the day prior.
 
Following a high of $1,924.47 on Wednesday, ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,859.00 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this decline, ethereum has fallen from its strongest point since Aug. 17, when the price hit a peak of $1,957.
 
 
Similar to bitcoin, today’s drop came as a result of the the RSI hovering below a recent support point at 61.00.
 
Overall, it appears that earlier bulls have moved to take profits, ahead of the upcoming uncertainty in the market.
 
At the time of writing, ethereum is trading at $1,871.63.

This is an opinion editorial by Mickey Koss, a West Point graduate with a degree in economics. He spent four years in the infantry before transitioning to the Finance Corps.
The demand for tokenizing assets like real estate is not a solution to, but rather a symptom of, the problems that bad money perpetuates. Real estate should be reduced to its utility value as a dwelling or place of business, rather than used as a store of value by proxy if we ever hope to solve the growing gap in wealth inequality.

Ringoshi Toitsu, a well-known validator of the Unification (FUND) network shared this news on Twitter. In a tweet dated April 5, Toitsu posted a screenshot of an interaction with a community user and the Unification Foundation.
 
In the conversation, Unification is addressing the critical issue of the centralization of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) node operations. SHIB’s layer-2 technology will therefore use Unification’s upcoming tool UNODE for decentralized applications (dapps) in the Shibarium ecosystem.
