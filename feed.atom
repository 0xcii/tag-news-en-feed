According to a report by local media outlet Moneyweb, crypto exchange Kraken has stopped accepting deposits from its users in South Africa. This decision was made because Kraken’s banking partner placed the country on its anti-money laundering blacklist. 
 
Something similar happened earlier this year when USDC’s issuer, Circle, halted fiat payments from users in the country. It is believed Circle had made that decision in anticipation of greater financial sanctions on the country.
