        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto.com has achieved a new milestone by surpassing  
100 million global users, marking a significant achievement for the company  
since its inception in 2016. The cryptocurrency exchange attributes this  
achievements to its latest marketing campaign, including partnerships with  
renowned personalities, venues, and events.
Some of the marketing efforts include hosting NBA and  
NHL Playoffs at the Crypto.com Arena and the Formula 1 Crypto.com Miami Grand  
Prix. Additionally, the firm recently released the brand film  
"INEVITABLE," under the campaign "Fortune Favors the  
Brave." 
Kris Marszlek, the CEO of Crypto.com, mentioned:  
"Positioning our brand through engaging campaigns and iconic partnerships  
has made Crypto.com a household name. But I'm most proud of the fact that we've  
surpassed the 100 million user milestone while building the most widely  
regulated platform in the industry by leading in global licenses and  
registrations."
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.
