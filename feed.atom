If, in 2021, the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery, so too does the two-year period from 2008 to 2010 when Bitcoin’s creator served as the project’s principal developer and leader. 
Yet, far from a lifeless period of project development, during those years Nakamoto worked with dozens if not hundreds of Bitcoin users, all of whom contributed to the effort in different ways, establishing websites, engaging in commerce and evangelizing for his invention. 
Still, some users naturally emerged as more distinguished contributors. 
Whether it was by helping establish core elements of the Bitcoin philosophy or articulating its value propositions in new and novel ways, a meritocracy develope…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto market experienced a notable pullback yesterday, with many assets retreating to lower levels. Avalanche (AVAX) suffered a 15% decline from its recent local top of $28.01.
