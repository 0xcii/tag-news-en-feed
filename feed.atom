This follows yesterday evening’s last minute request from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for additional comments on the S-1 filings from all applicants.
 
Despite initial concerns about potential delays, as reported by Bitcoinist, reassurances were offered by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart and Davis Polk’s Scott Johnsson, which have alleviated such fears. Seyffart predicted that the amendments will drop today. “I don’t think this is necessarily a delay signal. Really this just shows how quickly the SEC is turning these things around,” he remarked.
