BTC Drop Purging Speculators, Markets Shifting To Spot Trading
 
Amid the fear gripping the market following this wave of liquidation, one analyst took to X, saying the collapse of bulls this week was necessary. According to Ki Young Ju, the founder of CryptoQuant, a crypto analytics platform, the Bitcoin market has been futures-driven for “a long time.”
