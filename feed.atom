        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs is driven by a startling 27% rise in adoption that occurs within the second quarter of 2024. That increase reflects a growing confidence of institutional players in the digital currency market.
 
 
Data provided by K33 Research showed that over 260 new firms joined the US spot Bitcoin ETF space, skyrocketing the total number of professional firms holding these ETFs to 1,199 as of the end of June.
 
Retail Vs. Institutional Investors
 
Although institutional interest is high, retail investors own most Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional investors increased to 21% of total AUM in June from 18% in Q1. This development shows that ordinary investors control the market even as institutions gain ground.
