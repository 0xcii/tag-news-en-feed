The survey exposed a possible change in the political scene as the 2024 elections draws near. According to the June poll of 1,025 Republican voters, nearly 30% of them had made cryptocurrency investments.
 
The results of the poll imply that the Republican Party is seeing cryptocurrencies as a major issue more and more that fits its principles of financial independence and little government intrusion. Therefore, the junction of digital money with conservative ideas might be rather important in determining the party’s policies and voter outreach campaigns in the next elections.

On-chain analytics platform Santiment mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that non-exchange Shiba Inu whales have been accumulating more SHIB, with these investors now holding 6.57 trillion SHIB tokens than they did a month ago. This accumulation trend coincides with the decline in exchange wallets, suggesting that more retail investors are entering the meme coin’s ecosystem.

According to Mr. Black, the efforts to promote the collection on the Elon Musk-owned social media X (previously known as Twitter) failed.

BitMEX became a possible refuge for illegal financial activity thanks to a fragile façade of compliance, hiding a reality where little identity verification and a reckless attitude towards regulatory control let BitMEX grow.
