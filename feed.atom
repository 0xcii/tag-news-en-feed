The Skepticism Surrounding Digital Currencies
 
During a parliamentary committee meeting, Orr expressed skepticism regarding Bitcoin’s capacity to function as a “viable alternative” or “supplement” to traditional fiat currencies. Orr’s critique extended beyond BTC to include stablecoins, which he labeled as one of the “biggest misnomers” in the financial industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The founder and CEO of Vailshare Capital, Dr. Jeff Ross, now argues that the reason people hold and invest in Bitcoin is not because they are diversifying. In a post on X, Ross explained that the goal is because most want to preserve and gradually grow their purchasing power, not spread risks.
 
Bitcoin Is For Preserving Purchasing Power
 
The CEO’s perspective directly contradicts the conventional wisdom often held by financial advisors. Most recommend diversification, including into store-of-value assets like gold, as a key strategy to mitigate risk. 
 
On the contrary, Ross asserts that traditional assets like bonds, while offering diversification, can be susceptible to inflation risks, potentially gnawing purchasing power in the long run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin has surged past the $50,000 mark today, according to CoinMarketCap data, reaching this milestone for the first time since December 2021. 
 
         
         
         
        
CoinMarketCap
 
    
The breakthrough marks a significant recovery for Bitcoin, which faced massive volatility and fluctuations over the last couple years, reaching lows of around $16,000. Bitcoin's resilience and upward trajectory underscore its status as a store of value and a hedge against inflation in todays grim economic landscape.
Investors are closely monitoring Bitcoin's price movements, with many viewing the $50,000 level as a crucial psychological barrier. The surge in Bitcoin's price reflects renewed confidence in the asset's long-term potential and its ability to attract institutional investment.



This year's upward price movement has been mainly fueled by spot Bitcoin ETF demand, which is seeing adoption by mainstream financial institutions and increasing retail investor participation. The immense amount of selling pressure by Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF, in addition to miners selling off coins, appears to now be almost exhausted. So now with the inflows for all the other spot Bitcoin ETFs accelerating, buying demand is far exceeding any current selling pressure.
Also, with the halving event quickly approaching for Bitcoin, market participants have been vocal about eagerly buying up BTC before the mining reward gets cut in half, which is expected to create a supply shock later in the year.]]></summary>
