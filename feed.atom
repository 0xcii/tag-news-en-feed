After seven failed attempts, this puts the price once again just below the current key level that separates BTC from $30,000.
 
A powerful price move will also benefit the broader crypto market as the rotation in altcoins aka altcoin season has still failed to materialize. Bitcoin and crypto investors should therefore keep an eye on key macro data in the week ahead.

Banking Woes for Binance US
While searching for a key banking partner, Binance US is now using the services of at least one intermediary bank for holding cash deposits from crypto traders on the platform. The services of an intermediary bank rather than a direct banking partner slow the exchange services for customers like deposits and withdrawals of US dollars.  

Previously, Binance US  used the services of Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank as its only two banking partners in the US for customer deposits. However, both the crypto-friendly banks failed last month: Silvergate declared voluntary liqui…]]></summary>

The renowned economist listed a few factors for the diminishing status of the greenback such as its use as a political weapon by Washington, the introduction of currencies like the digital yuan, and America’s shrinking share of the global economy. 
 
United States’ Smaller Share in World Economy to Affect the Dollar
 
The role of the U.S. dollar will naturally decrease as the share of the United States in the planet’s economy becomes smaller and settlements in other currencies take hold, economics professor and Director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University Jeffrey Sachs predicted.
