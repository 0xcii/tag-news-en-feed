Crowd Bearish About Solana & Bitcoin While Ethereum Gets All The Hype
 
As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment in a post on X, investors have still not become bullish about Bitcoin and Solana despite their recent surge.
 
The relevant indicator here is the “Weighted Sentiment,” which is based on two other metrics: Sentiment Balance and Social Volume. The former measures the net sentiment among cryptocurrency traders right now.

Prison Transfer Despite New York Preference
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal today (Wednesday),  
this decision was made by overriding Bankman-Fried's request. Bankman-Fried,

to the collapse of FTX, including allegations of stealing $8 billion from  
customers, had expressed his desire to stay in New York to aid in his appeal

The Commission filed a letter in opposition to Ripple’s motion to seal certain documents related to the remedies stage. In line with an earlier report, the SEC noted that they weren’t opposing Ripple’s requests in its entirety. For the opposed redactions, the Commission argued that the crypto firm had failed to “overcome the strong presumption that court filings should be public.”

You may have heard about re-enabling OP_CAT as a potential upgrade for bitcoin's script language. Depending on where you get your news OP_CAT has been called "only 10 lines of code", "the best way to enable experimentation with covenants", "too powerful", "dangerous and leading to miner centralization", or "guaranteed to lead to a contentious soft fork". I'm going to make the case that all of these perspectives are mistaken. OP_CAT is very useful, can be used as a covenant, and not (alone) the best next move for bitcoin. Nothing more, and nothing less.
To make that case, I'm going to explore several (apparently disjoint) topics, some of which were new to me a few short months ago. I'm going to try and arrange this in a way that provides the necessary background in one place.

From Hero To Zero: Trust Eroded By Unannounced Fees
 
Nexo had managed to carve out a niche as a customer-centric exchange. Their ability to dodge legal troubles and a swift reversal of a disliked fee policy in April had painted a picture of a platform that listened. However, this carefully crafted image shattered on May 21st when users woke up to emails announcing a significant hike in bank transfer fees.
