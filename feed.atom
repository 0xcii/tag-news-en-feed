Initially, FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) faced eight charges when indicted by the U.S. government, but shortly after, an additional five charges were tacked on including alleged bank fraud and bribing a Chinese government official.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana climbed for a third consecutive session, as crypto markets rebounded to start the weekend. At the time of writing, the global market cap rose by 3.3%, as bullish sentiment returned. Polygon was another notable gainer, surging by over 5% on Saturday.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) raced to a one-week high on Saturday, as crypto prices rallied following a recent spell of downward sentiment.
 
After falling to a low of $14.47 during yesterday’s session, SOL/USD bounced to a peak of $16.07 to start the weekend.
 
The move came as the token continued to distance itself from a recent support point at the $14.00 mark.
 
 
From the chart, it seems that the latest rise in price has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) to a resistance zone at 36.00.
 
This has led to earlier bulls abandoning their positions, leading to the index now tracking at 35.77.
 
In the event this hurdle is overcome, there is a good chance that SOL will move towards $17.00.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Additionally, polygon (MATIC) also made sizeable gains on Saturday, climbing by as much as 6% today.
 
MATIC/USD jumped to an intraday high of $0.6302 to start the weekend, a day after falling to a low of $0.5624.
 
As a result of the surge, polygon once again rose past a floor at $0.5760 and seems set to collide with a ceiling at $0.6700.
 
 
Despite today’s gains, MATIC still remains oversold, with price strength tracking at the 29.12 level.
 
This is however a positive for bulls, as there is still substantial upside to entering at this current level.
 
There is still a degree of uncertainty also, as a resistance point at 31.00 will likely test the strength of buyers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin bounced back strongly to start the weekend, as prices moved closer to the $27,000 mark in today’s session. After a recent spell of consolidation, bulls returned to action, buying the recent dip in the process. Ethereum was also higher, closing in on $1,800 on Saturday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) surged on Saturday, as bulls of the cryptocurrency moved to buy the recent dip in price.
 
BTC/USD rose to a high of $26,769.39 to start the weekend, which comes less than a day after trading at a low of $25,245.36.
 
The move pushed the price to its highest point since May 8, a day when the price was at a peak of $26,820.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally came when the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) finally broke out of a key ceiling at 43.00.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is tracking at 50.55, which is close to a new resistance at the 51.00 level.
 
Traders are likely targeting the $27,300 level, and could hit this if momentum continues to be bullish this weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also rebounded strongly to start the weekend, days after falling to a three-month low.
 
Following a low of $1,653.17 on Friday, ETH/USD raced to an intraday peak at the $1,766.76 level earlier today.
 
ETH fell to a bottom at $1,620 on Thursday, which was the weakest point that the price had hit since March 13.
 
 
Similar to BTC, a breakout of the RSI was one of the triggers of the move, with price strength climbing past a ceiling at 41.00.
 
The index is currently at a reading of 43.79, with the next resistance level at the 50.00 mark.

In a surprising turn of events, an entrepreneur he had previously investigated, Jeffrey Huang, has filed a defamation lawsuit against him. 
 
The accusation stems from ZachXBT’s accusations on June 2022 that Huang, a Taiwanese-American musician and tech executive also known as Machi Big Brother, embezzled a staggering sum of 22,000 ETH, valued at approximately $37.8 million, from a now-defunct crypto treasury management platform. 
 
What makes this case particularly intriguing is that ZachXBT had meticulously supported his allegations with mountains of concrete on-chain data, lending weight to his assertions.

Watkins also argued that the few games which did gain traction “relied on the allure of making money” which is not a sustainable model. 
 
Web3 Gaming Not a Passing Fad
 
However, in his written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, the Digital Arms CEO insisted that the industry’s focus has shifted back to making games with experiences and benefits which cannot be matched by traditional gaming. This shift in turn means Web3 gaming “is really just getting started” and may not be a passing fad as claimed by some critics, Watkins a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager, has filed to register a bitcoin trust that some believe is actually a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in disguise. Blackrock is seeking to launch a bitcoin product despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) efforts to crack down on unregistered crypto platforms and securities tokens. The asset management firm has also chosen Coinbase, the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange that was recently charged by the SEC for securities law violations, to serve as custodian for its bitcoin trust.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bittrex US, the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, has recently introduced a plan that permits American customers to withdraw crypto and fiat from the platform, provided they satisfy the required regulatory criteria. This withdrawal arrangement was approved on Tuesday by the U.S. bankruptcy court located in Delaware.
 
Cryptocurrency Exchange Bittrex US Enables Customer Withdrawals
 
On May 8, 2023, Bittrex US filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing liabilities ranging from $500 million to $1 billion and having over 100,000 creditors. Before the bankruptcy filing, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had sued Bittrex for running an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency, and for listing unregistered crypto securities.
 
Bittrex sent emails to its U.S. customers this week, following approval from the U.S. bankruptcy court to enable withdrawals. However, there is a caveat: users must update their know-your-customer (KYC) information and agree to the latest terms of service. Bittrex asserts that this step is “necessary to comply with state and federal regulations.”
 
Withdrawals opened on June 15, 2023, and the company has provided resources for identity verification, withdrawal instructions, and wire instructions. “Customers have until August 31, 2023, to withdraw any remaining funds,” Bittrex states. While cryptocurrency withdrawals are relatively simple, fiat withdrawals require the submission of an application to link a bank account. Additionally, there is a $25 wire fee for customers who choose to wire funds through Bittrex.
