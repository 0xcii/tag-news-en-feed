        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was a notable mover to start the weekend, as the meme coin rose for a second consecutive session. The surge comes despite the global crypto market cap mostly consolidating today. Chainlink also raced higher, hitting a five-week high.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) continued to move away from a recent support point on Saturday, as the price rose for a second straight day.
 
SHIB/USD peaked at $0.000007391 earlier in the day, which comes following a low of $0.00000725 the day before.
 
The move saw shiba inu distance itself from a floor of $0.00000710, moving closer to a ceiling of $0.00000760 instead.
 
 
As the price approaches this point of resistance, the 10-day (red) moving average also nears an upward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In order to reach this point, bulls will first need to orchestrate a move beyond a ceiling of 44.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is tracking at 42.46.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) was another big mover to start the weekend, as the price surged to a multi-week high.
 
After falling to a low of $6.73 on Friday, LINK/USD jumped to a peak of $7.13 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the surge, chainlink climbed to its strongest point since August 15, when the price peaked at $7.42.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the rally led to a resistance level at $6.90 being broken, however, price uncertainty has begun to creep in.
 
LINK is now trading at $7.00, which comes as the RSI struggles to jump over a hurdle at 64.00 on the RSI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the weekend in consolidation, as traders seemingly found a new price floor at $26,500. The price uncertainty comes as markets settled following a volatile week, which was headlined by the Federal Reserve rate decision. Ethereum remains below $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin consolidated for a second straight session, with the cryptocurrency hovering around a floor at $26,500.
 
Following a high of $26,786.10 on Friday, BTC/USD slipped to a low of $26,389.30 earlier in the session.
 
The price of bitcoin has since rebounded, and at the time of writing this is trading at the $26,581.84 level.
 
 
It appears that the rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to break out of its own floor at 50.00.
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is tracking at 50.01, and should this hold, bulls could be tempted to reenter the market.
 
Moving averages continue to signal that there could be an incoming uptrend, with the 10-day (red) trend line still higher.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) remained under the $1,600 on Saturday, despite attempts by bulls to reenter this region.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a low of $1,587.43 to start the weekend, hours after bulls pushed price to an high of $1,599.97.
 
However, it appears that there could be another attempt to move past this level, with ethereum currently trading at $1,593.07.
 
 
Unlike bitcoin, an upwards crossover of moving averages has yet to occur, however it seems like this could happen at any point.
 
This could ultimately be the signal bulls need to amplify pressure, and potentially engulf current sellers.
