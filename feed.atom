After its launch, Ethereum users could withdraw their stake ETH from the “Beacon Chain,” the platform that initially supported the PoS migration. As a result, there is much speculation about the potential impact on the market.
 
As of this writing, Ethereum is rallying and seems poised to continue its uptrend beyond the $1,900 area and into the $2,000 region. However, the last time the cryptocurrency underwent a major upgrade, it was followed by a market sell-off and a decline into critical support zones.

Microstrategy Buys Another Batch of Bitcoins
 
Microstrategy has begun acquiring bitcoin (BTC) again, after purchasing 6,455 bitcoins for $150 million on March 27. On April 5, the firm’s CEO announced that it had acquired an additional 1,045 bitcoins, bringing the company’s total holdings to 140,000 BTC. The publicly traded company now has the largest stockpile of bitcoins of any firm worldwide, representing 0.667% of the 21 million BTC supply cap.
 
“Microstrategy has acquired an additional 1,045 bitcoin for ~ $29.3M at an average price of $28,016 per bitcoin,” Saylor tweeted on Wednesday. “As of 4/4/2023 Microstrategy holds 140,000 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.17 billion at an average price of $29,803 per bitcoin.”
 
 
The publicly traded company with the second-largest holding of BTC is Galaxy Digital, with 40,000 BTC. Microstrategy’s stockpile of bitcoins is the same size as Block.one’s and 1,686 BTC smaller than the Mt. Gox bitcoins held by the bankruptcy court trustee in Tokyo. Microstrategy has been acquiring bitcoins since August 2020 and has employed the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy for its investments.

US Bitcoin Corp, a bitcoin mining company which has been operating a mining facility in the City of Niagara Falls, has reached a tentative agreement with the city to restart operations according to a report.
The miner, which recently agreed to a merger with Hut 8, putting both companies under the umbrella of Hut 8 Corp., will have to comply with strict measures in order to begin operations which were halted in March by a state supreme court judge. The judge found that the operators of the facility were in contempt of another judge's court order.
Under the agreement, US Bitcoin would be required to comply with a series of standards for noise reduction and permit applications. These include limiting noise production from the facility to no more than 65 decibels and submitting completed applications for all permits needed to comply with the city's new “high energy usage overlay district,” the report details.

They would also have to compensate the city in several ways, including paying an upfront, non-refundable $50,000 fee upon execution of the agreement. In addition to the $50,000 upfront fee, US Bitcoin would be required to pay the city a $100,000 compliance fee within 30 days of the agreement's effective date.
The company would also be required to reimburse the city for $180,000 in attorney fees and costs tied to its enforcement action against the company, as listed in the agreement.
The Niagara Falls City Council still has to approve the agreement.]]></summary>
