        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-matic-move-to-multi-week-highs-on-wednesday/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-20T15:42:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was a big mover on Wednesday, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly consolidating in today’s session. Traders have moved to secure recent gains, ahead of September’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Polygon was also in the green, hitting a two-week high in the process.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was a notable gainer in today’s session, as the token raced to a multi-week high.
 
Following a low of $0.5092 on Tuesday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday peak at $0.5233 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the surge in price, XRP climbed to its highest point since August 31, when price peaked at $0.5285.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came as the relative strength index (RSI) broke free of a ceiling at 48.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 50.66, with bulls possibly targeting a ceiling at 58.00.
 
In the event traders reach this target, there is a strong chance XRP will move above $0.5500.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
In addition to XRP, polygon (MATIC) also surged to a multi-week high on Wednesday, despite market uncertainty ahead of the Fed announcement.
 
MATIC/USD peaked at $0.5486 earlier in today’s session, after rebounding from a low of $0.536 the day before.
 
The move pushed polygon to its strongest level since September 8, when the token reached a high of $0.5586.
 
 
Earlier gains have since faded, and this appears to be due to the RSI failing to break out of its ceiling at the 49.00 mark.
 
Currently, price strength sits at 47.34, however momentum remains largely bullish, ahead of a potential moving average crossover.
 
The 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) trend lines are on the cusp of an upwards cross, which could trigger a fresh price surge.

DOJ Wants Extra Day In Sam Bankman-Fried Trial

The September 19 letter wants Judge Kaplan to approve an addition of Friday, October 6, to the trial dates already scheduled to begin on October 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its  
creation in 2011, Litecoin (LTC) has remained a notable digital asset in the  
fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies. Its historical significance as a crypto  
pioneer cannot be overstated. However, in today's ever-changing crypto market,  
where does Litecoin stand, and what lays ahead for it?
The Unique  
Beginnings of Litecoin
Litecoin arose  
from a desire to address some of Bitcoin's restrictions. Litecoin sought to  
provide faster transaction confirmations and reduced costs by using an  
alternative hashing algorithm called Scrypt. This distinguishing feature  
distinguished it from its older sibling, Bitcoin, as a potential solution for  
everyday transactions and micropayments.
Litecoin has  
made major contributions to the cryptocurrency ecosystem throughout the years.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a turn of events that has sounded alarms in the crypto community, Coinbase warned that it has observed a single mining pool, ViaBTC, controlling 53.8% of the Zcash network hash rate. The cryptocurrency exchange promptly took precautionary actions to mitigate the risks associated with a 51% attack, a situation that arises when a single entity controls over half of the computational power on a blockchain network.
 
Coinbase’s Mitigation Measures
 
Upon detecting this significant centralization in the Zcash network, Coinbase promptly increased the Zcash confirmation requirement to 110 block confirmations, elongating deposit times from an average 40 minutes to roughly 2.5 hours.

An ETF is a financial product that allows investors to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly own it. In the case of a Bitcoin ETF, it would provide investors with a convenient way to invest in Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. But what would happen if a Bitcoin ETF is approved? Let's dive into the potential implications and outcomes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin retreated from recent highs on Wednesday, ahead of the upcoming U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate announcement. The Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged, despite inflation rising by more than expected in August. Ethereum also gave up gains in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin started the day trading marginally lower, as markets prepared for the highly anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate decision.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,918.32 on Wednesday, following a peak at $27,488.76 the day prior.
 
In addition to the rate decision, the FOMC will give an economic forecast, which could provide some forward guidance on future policy decisions.

One of the catalysts for the drop in price was the relative strength index (RSI), which fell below a ceiling at the 60.00 mark.
 
The index is now tracking around the 57.08 level, and is moving towards a support point at 55.00.
 
Overall, momentum remains largely bullish, with today’s decline largely due to profit taking ahead of the Fed announcement.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also slipped lower during today’s session, which can also be attributed to traders opting to secure gains.
 
Following a high of $1,669.02 on Tuesday, ETH/USD dropped to a low of $1,621.36 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency fell close to a support point of $1,620.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Price has since rebounded, with ethereum trading at $1,631 at the time of writing, owing to bulls choosing to reject a breakout.
 
An earlier failed breakout attempt seems to be the reason for the decline, with the RSI unable to rise above a ceiling of 49.00.
 
Price strength now sits at 45.72, with a floor of 40.00 a possible target for short sellers.

autonomously through code, allowing its members to collaboratively rule and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a fresh twist to the ongoing exploration of sidechain possibilities, Botanix Labs recently released a proposal for Spiderchain, a new layer 2 protocol for Bitcoin. With the community’s attention largely directed towards Drivechains, Jameson Lopp, a Bitcoin OG, dives into the intricacies of the Spiderchain system in his recent blog post. Here’s an in-depth look at the proposal and its implications for the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems.
 
Why Spiderchain?
 
In Lopp’s analysis of the Botanix whitepaper, he notes that while there are many proposals geared towards enhancing Bitcoin’s Layer 2 capabilities, such as drivechains, zero knowledge rollups, and validity rollups, Spiderchain distinguishes itself by being immediately implementable on the existing Bitcoin protocol.
