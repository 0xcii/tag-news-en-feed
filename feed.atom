XRP’s Unique Value Proposition
 
According to John Deaton, his first purchase occurred in 2016 due to the attributes of the coin. However, the attorney revealed that he also bought more XRP coins in 2019, following its listing on the popular San Francisco exchange Coinbase. Notably, the crypto exchange touted the coin as one of the best cryptos for cross-border transactions.

The US House of Representatives yesterday approved a bill to raise the debt ceiling. With a narrow majority, the Republican-dominated House of Representatives passed the proposal of its chairman, Kevin McCarthy.
 
The bill proposes raising the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion, but only if there are also significant cuts in government spending. Largely because of this, the bill is not expected to have much of a chance in the Democrats-led Senate. Also, President Joe Biden has already signaled his intention to veto the bill.
 
However, urgency is needed. Doomsday could come as early as “a few weeks,” according to experts. The US Treas…]]></summary>

Crypto Futures Market Has Observed Mass Liquidations During Past Day
 
The “liquidation” of a crypto futures contract happens when the exchange forcibly closes the position due to the holder accumulating losses equal to a specific percentage of the margin (the initial collateral).
 
A factor that can significantly raise the risk of a contract being liquidated is the “leverage,” which is a loan amount that an investor may choose to take against the margin, and it’s often many times the size of the initial position itself.
 
The obvious benefit of leverage is that if the bet works out and the price moves in the profit direction, the gains made …]]></summary>

Although Binance does not publicly disclose any financial reports regarding the billionaire’s stake and the company’s revenues, Bloomberg conducted its own analysis and concluded that CZ’s net worth is approximately $28.2 billion, placing him in the 3rd spot on their list of the top 25 wealthiest individuals.
 
And while most individuals on the list would be proud, CZ appears to have been taken aback by the figures, and slammed Bloomberg for its alleged false narrative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
