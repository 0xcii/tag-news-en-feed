Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposition to levy a substantial fine of nearly $2  
billion against the company linked to the XRP Ledger blockchain. Filed yesterday  
(Monday), Ripple's opposition challenges the SEC's proposal, which seeks to

Legal Battle Between Ripple and SEC
The SEC's proposal outlines a fine totalling $1.95 billion,  
comprising $876 million for disgorgement, $198 million for prejudgment  
interest, and a civil penalty of $876 million. The basis for the SEC's case

The controversy centers around a lawsuit filed by the SEC in August 2023, alleging a $50 million crypto fraud scheme perpetrated by DEBT Box. To halt the Utah-based company’s operations, the SEC secured a temporary freeze on its assets and restraining orders against its executives.
 
However, the case unraveled spectacularly in March 2024 when Judge Robert J. Shelby of the Utah District Court sanctioned the SEC for “egregious misrepresentations” during the initial hearing.…]]></summary>
