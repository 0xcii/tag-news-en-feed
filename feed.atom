        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-outlook-for-april-btc-hits-31000-what-next/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-14T20:37:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the halfway point of April, bitcoin has risen beyond the $31,000 point for the first time in ten months. This rise in bullish sentiment comes as global inflation continues to fall, with many expecting central banks to soon pivot from current policies of monetary tightening. 
 
Current Market Status
 

 
April started mostly with consolidation, as traders continued to digest the last month’s banking crash, and Federal Reserve 25 basis point rate hike.
 

 
However, following the non-farm payrolls report, which dropped to 236,000 in March, down from 326,000 the month prior, bulls began to reenter the market.
 

 
Since then, inflation data has also been released, with consumer prices in China falling to an eighteen-month low, which pushed bitcoin back above $30,000.
 

 
In the United States, prices have also dipped, falling to 5% in March, with retail sales, also edging lower.
 

 

 
April Outlook
 

 
These factors have so far helped bitcoin, and led to prices moving above $31,000 for the first time since last June.
 

 
During last month’s outlook, BTC was trading at a low of $19,628.25 on March 10, and as of writing, BTC/USD has now moved to a high of $31,005.61 earlier today.
 

 
One of the catalysts for this move was a breakout, which took place on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 

 

 

 
Bulls moved past a ceiling at the 68.00 mark, moving deep into overbought territory, by hitting a peak at 72.44.
 

 
In January, the index rose to a high of 89.00, which means that despite being overbought, there could still be some further gains as the month progresses.
 

 
However, should the RSI fall below its aforementioned support at 68.00, bears could begin to reappear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trust will utilize three separate key holders to offer the benefits of multisignature custody to institutional investors.
Onramp Bitcoin has launched the first-ever spot bitcoin trust product that employs multi-party custody. This product is tailored to high-net-worth individuals, corporations and institutions seeking to gain exposure to bitcoin, according to a press release. 
The trust product will utilize three institutional-grade key holders, a qualified custodian named Kingdom Trust, and Bitcoin custody service firm Unchained Capital, to ensure that the custody of client bitcoin has no single point of failure. 
Onramp is the first trust to leverage a multi-signature setup, requiring a quorum to move funds. The product is designed for those who want exposure to bitcoin without the tradeoffs of full third-party custody, but who are not yet ready to take on the responsibility of full self-custody.
According to the press release, Onramp's solution is also intended to address the limitations of existing Bitcoin fund vehicles, including single-point-of-failure custody, taxable events on withdrawal and lack of Bitcoin focus and education. 
The trust will have a “Bitcoin-only focus with a commitment to education and advisory services to help clients excel during periods of volatility,” the press release describes.
The product will also offer segregated accounts with the ability to take possession of the underlying bitcoin without incurring a taxable event.]]></summary>
