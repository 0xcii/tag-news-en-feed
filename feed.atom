        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On September 17, 2015, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) officially declared Bitcoin a commodity, a distinction that eight years later continues to set it apart from other cryptocurrencies that have yet to earn this status.
While regulatory uncertainty still looms over other more centralized, digital assets, the CFTC's classification of Bitcoin as a commodity established a regulatory framework for Bitcoin, one that allows it to be treated like other classical commodities including gold and precious metals.
In its ruling, the CFTC stated that Section 1a(9) of the CEA defines commodity to include "all services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in."
"The definition of a 'commodity' is broad... Bitcoin and othe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin and crypto market is holding its breath in anticipation of the week ahead, particularly due to a singular, critical event: the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision followed by the FOMC press conference featuring Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This looming decision has the potential to ripple through all financial markets, from Wall Street to the decentralized corridors of Bitcoin and crypto.
 
Other events that could have a potential impact on the market are rather rare this week. Only the already last week approved liquidation of the FTX holdings (maximum $100 million, $200 million per week under certain circumstances) could be news-worthy. However, since the liquidations do not require any announcements, there will be no big headlines.
