        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. In recent years, meme coins have gained significant traction due to various social media trends and hype. This is because these coins are often associated with fun and accessible ways to invest in cryptocurrency.

With the help of social media campaigns, memes, and other forms of online activism, this decentralised group of SHIB enthusiasts has promoted the coin and increased its v…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-ada-drop-to-multi-week-lows-on-friday/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-21T16:09:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp plunged to a multi-week low in Friday’s session, as the token slipped for a third consecutive session. The move pushed prices to their lowest point since late March, with the global market cap trading 2.39% lower as of writing. Cardano also fell to a two-week low.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was deep in the red on Friday, as prices fell for a third consecutive session.
 
Following a high of $0.4838 on Thursday, XRP/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.4644 earlier today.
 
As a result of this drop, XRP fell to its lowest point since March 27, when the token was at a bottom at $0.4428.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this recent shift in momentum coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) breaking out of a floor at 57.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 42.24, which is close to a support point at 41.00.
 
Should price strength reach this point, then there is a good chance that XRP will hit a price floor at $0.4440.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) also fell to a multi-week low in today’s session, as prices moved closer to a key price floor.
 
ADA/USD dropped to a low of $0.3974 on Friday, less than 24 hours after trading at a peak of $0.4087.
 
This is the lowest level that cardano has hit since April 12, and comes following a three-day losing streak.
 
 
Similar to XRP, ADA’s decline came after the RSI moved below a floor at 52.00. It is currently at a reading of 49.18.
 
The next visible point of support appears to be at 45.00, and should sellers claim this zone, cardano will likely move to $0.3750.
 
This level is a long-term price floor, and was last hit on April 6.

In the world of finance and investing, supply shocks are a well-known phenomenon that can have significant impacts on the value of assets. One of the most well-known supply shocks in the cryptocurrency world is the Bitcoin halving, which occurs roughly every four years and cuts the supply of new BTC in half.

*This article has been corrected from "World's First" to "United States' First," as other worldwide real estate firms have accepted bitcoin prior.
MyEListing, a commercial real estate marketplace, is set to launch the United States' first bitcoin-enabled real estate marketplace through a Coinbase integration. This new platform allows buyers to purchase U.S. real estate properties with bitcoin or cash. MyEListing's CEO, Caleb Richter, stated that the program will "drive innovation in the crypto and real estate industries."
The press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine claims the program aims to bring new convenience, accessibility and greater profitability to the market. Agents can now list U.S. commercial and residential properties to be sold for cryptocurrency or cash on the platform, and anyone worldwide can purchase them within one business day through the ASAP program. The transaction times are also expected to be nearly 50 times faster than current averages, according to the press release.
The platform is initially launching for Texas-only properties on April 20, 2023, with plans to expand to other select states in June 2023. The list of available properties to purchase with bitcoin is available on the MyEListing website. The ASAP program's explainer video provides a step-by-step guide on how the process works.
The integration of Coinase by MyEListing is expected to change the way people invest in real estate by providing a secure and efficient way to buy and sell properties, the press release states. As Richter explained, "with the ASAP program, anyone, regardless of the language they speak or where they are in the world, can purchase residential and commercial real estate with crypto in as little as one business day."
The program's success will be determined in the coming months as it expands to other states and attracts more buyers and sellers.]]></summary>

There was a 10-month spike in Ethereum’s gas prices. According to data provided by Glassnode, the median price of ETH gas on a seven-day moving average has risen to 43.641 gwei, a level not seen since June 30 last year.
 
The network utilizes a measurement system based on the gwei. To perform a transaction or launch a smart contract on the Ethereum network, a certain amount of gas is required.

In the tweet, Kiyosaki shared his love for Bitcoin, citing its independence from governments, financial institutions and central banks as one of the main reasons for his prediction. According to the author of the best-selling book “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” this feature makes BTC a safer investment than traditional assets like stocks and bonds. He tweeted:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s downturn continued on Friday, as prices fell for a third consecutive session, leading to a move below $28,000. Market sentiment has shifted in recent days, as traders began taking profits from last week’s high. Ethereum was also lower, and is now trading around the $1,900 region.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved lower for a third consecutive session on Friday, as prices slipped below the $28,000 mark.
 
Following a high of $28,906.25 on Thursday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,855.96 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this move, bitcoin fell to its weakest point since April 9, which is the last time price hit a floor of $27,800.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Since nearing this point, BTC bulls have reentered the market, and have pushed price back above $28,000.
 
One of the catalysts for today’s drop came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell to a floor of its own at 46.00.
 
The index has marginally risen from this low, and is tracking at 46.35 at the time of writing.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also edged lower, with price nearing a breakout below the $1,900 mark.
 
Two days after hitting a peak at $2,105, ETH/USD dropped to a low of $1,904.42 earlier in today’s session.
 
This decline has resulted in the world’s second largest cryptocurrency now trading at its lowest level in eight-days.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, ethereum is trading nearly 10% lower than at the same time last week, when it rose above $2,000 for the first time since last May.
 
The RSI has also significantly dropped, with the index breaking out of a floor at the 53.00 level, and it is now at a reading of 49.46.
 
Should momentum continue to fall, bears will likely be targeting a point of support at 44.50.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
