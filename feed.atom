Ethereum Average Fees Has Registered A Notable Uptick Recently
 
In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment talked about how the Ethereum network has recently become more expensive. The metric of interest here is the “Average Fees,” which keeps track of the average fees that ETH users are currently attaching with their transfers.
 
How much fees senders might be willing to pay comes down to the activity level the blockchain is witnessing. In times of high traffic, transfers can get stuck for a while, as ETH has only a limited capacity to handle transactions. Those looking to beat the crowd, thus, go with a higher-than-average fee.

While there has been notable progress, including the approval of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Lummis pointed out that the US still lags behind the European Union’s ineffective regulation.
