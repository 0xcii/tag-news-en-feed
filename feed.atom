How USDT’s Dominance Predicts The Top For Bitcoin
 
Thomas claimed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that USDT dominance has predicted every Bitcoin local top for the last six years. He noted that there has always been a clear local top for Bitcoin each time the USDT dominance touches the bottom of a trendline, which the analyst highlighted on the chart. Thomas added that anyone who used this metric would have sold the top every time in the previous cycles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The saga of FTX, the fallen cryptocurrency exchange, takes a shocking turn as new evidence suggests founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) wasn’t acting alone.
 
Emails obtained by the Wall Street Journal allege a $100 million political donation scheme orchestrated by SBF and his entire family, raising serious questions about campaign finance violations and the misuse of customer funds.
 
 
A Family Affair: From Law Professor To Alleged Straw-Donor Architect
 
Central to the accusations is Joe Bankman, SBF’s father and a Stanford law professor. Emails reportedly detail his involvement in strategizing the alleged scheme, which prosecutors believe constitutes an illegal straw-donor operation.
