        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year, there has been a flurry of news reports and opinion editorials discussing an alleged de-dollarization trend amid a wave of disclosures associated with the BRICS bloc. In a recent article, the American political scientist and author Ian Bremmer insisted that claims of the U.S. dollar dying are overblown. In addition to Bremmer’s comments, economist Paul Krugman also asserted in a recent op-ed that the greenback isn’t going away anytime soon and called some of the speculators “‘Weimarists,’ people who are always predicting hyperinflation.”

Bitcoin Correlation To Gold Has Increased During The Past Year
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the correlation between the two assets remained high during the recent US banking crisis. The “BTC correlation to Gold” indicates how closely Bitcoin is following the movements taking place in the price of one troy ounce of Gold.
 
When the value of this metric is negative, it means BTC is currently responding to movements in the price of Gold by traveling in the opposite direction. On the other hand, positive values of the indicator imply the two assets are moving in a similar trajectory right now.
