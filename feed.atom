        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The largest NFT creation firm will host their first Bitcoin Ordinals project, just as the network passes 200,000 inscriptions.
The creators of CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club have introduced their first Bitcoin Ordinals NFT collection.
According to a blog post by Yuga Labs, the collection, titled “TwelveFold,” is an “Original and experimental 300-piece generative art collection inscribed onto satoshis that will live on the Bitcoin blockchain.” 
The pieces appear to be randomly generated bubble-like creations that “explore the relationship between time, mathematics, and variability.”
“TwelveFold is a base 12 art system localized around a 12x12 grid, a visual allegory for the cartography of data on the Bitcoin blockchain,” the blog post reads. “The collection includes highly-rendered 3D elements as well as hand-drawn features which serve as an homage to the ordinal inscriptions currently done by hand.”
Yuga Labs quickly ascended to the top of the NFT market due to the success and massive popularity of their flagship projects. A March 2022 seed round at the height of the NFT craze placed the value of the company at $4 billion. 
“All of these choices are a departure from what’s expected from Yuga,” the blog post reads. “But, you know. Fuck doing expected things.”

Yuga Labs’ entry into the Bitcoin marketplace could potentially indicate a new perception of Ordinals as a platform for the highest levels of NFT creation. The ability for NFTs to inherit the attributes of Bitcoin have brought them from the realm of third parties and centralized databases to the immutable, decentralized realm of Bitcoin.

Ordinals and inscriptions brought NFTs to Bitcoin, allowing content, such as images, videos and HTML to be included in a Bitcoin transaction and assigned to an individual satoshi. More than 100,000 collectibles were inscribed within the first three weeks of Ordinals being introduced. Now, Bitcoin full nodes host more than 200,000 inscriptions, a testament to the popularity of adding images to Bitcoin.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-avax-hits-2-week-low-as-dot-extends-recent-losses/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-28T16:37:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avalanche fell to a two-week low on Tuesday, as the token broke out of a key support point. Prices fell below a floor at $17.50, which comes as the global cryptocurrency market cap is down by 1.01% as of writing. Polkadot also extended its recent losses, falling by nearly 3% on Feb. 28.
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
Avalanche (AVAX) slipped to a multi-week low on Tuesday, as prices moved below a key support point.
 
Following a high of $18.62 to start the week, AVAX/USD dropped to a bottom of $17.39 earlier in today’s session.
 
This move saw avalanche hit its weakest level since February 13, which is the last time prices were under $17.00.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that one of the catalysts for the drop was a breakout on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Price strength dropped below a floor at 43.00, and as of writing, the RSI is tracking at the 42.28 level.
 
The next visible point of support seems to be near the 40.00 mark, and should this be hit, there is a strong chance that AVAX will move below $17.00.
 
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
In addition to AVAX, polkadot (DOT) also extended recent losses, falling for a second straight session.
 
DOT/USD moved to a low of $6.43 on Tuesday, after starting the week trading at a high of $6.78.
 
As a result of today’s drop, DOT has now fallen for seven of the last eight sessions, dropping by over 11% in that time.
 
 
Like with AVAX, today’s sell-off came as the RSI broke out of a floor — in this instance the 48.00 zone.
 
As of writing, the index is hovering closer to 47.00, with bears seemingly targeting a support point at $6.30.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average is now firmly downward facing, which sums up the current momentum in the market.

The government of Ras Al Khaimah says this free zone will be called the RAK Digital Assets Oasis. This announcement was made recently in the international forum Blockchain Life 2023.
 
The reason behind such a decision could be that the UAE wants to invite global crypto businesses to set up shop in Ras Al Khaimah, one of the seven Emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). With this new move, the free zone will enable innovation for non-regulated activities within the virtual asset space.
