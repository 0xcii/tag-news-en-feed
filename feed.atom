        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The general consensus is that Bitcoin is gearing up for a rally that would send it past its all-time high in the coming weeks. Given the recent inflows into the cryptocurrency and its recent price performance, analysts are confident of Bitcoin going on a parabolic rally into new price territories in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 
Notably, the $100,000 price mark has remained a psychological target for investors, as it would project the price of the cryptocurrency into six-digit threshold. According to a crypto analyst known as Peter DiCarlo, Bitcoin is looking ready for a run-up to this level. However, a resistance level needs to be cleared first.

His net worth has increased dramatically to $201 billion in less than two years, nearly sixfold. The skyrocketing stock price of Meta Platforms Inc., which has increased by about 60% just this year, is mostly the impetus for this surge.
 
Consequently, Zuckerberg is once again the fourth richest person in the world, behind only Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault, and Elon Musk.
 
 
The Metaverse: A Mixed Bag
 
Despite these amazing numbers, the metaverse remains controversy-ridden. While Zuckerberg maintains that it is the future of social interaction, many remain skeptical about it.
