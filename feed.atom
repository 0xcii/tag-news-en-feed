Dogecoin Cools Down After Showing Strong Bullish Momentum
 
Until just a couple of days back, Dogecoin seemed to have finally been putting together some promising bullish momentum, as the asset had managed to breach the $0.083 level. In these past two days, though, the coin has once again slipped up, as its price has registered a notable drawdown.
 
Following the latest 3% decline in the meme coin during the past day, its value is trading around $0.0767. The below chart shows how DOGE’s price has changed recently.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-shib-surges-to-2-week-high-on-friday-whilst-trx-extends-gains/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-28T15:44:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was a notable gainer on Friday, climbing to a two-week high during today’s session in the process. The move came as the meme coin rose by as much as 6%, despite the global crypto market cap mostly consolidating. Tron rose for a fourth straight session today. 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) rallied to a two-week high on Friday, after breaking out of a key resistance level.
 
SHIB/USD surged to a peak of $0.000008217 earlier in today’s session, following Thursday’s low at $0.000007754.
 
Friday’s move came as shiba inu broke out of a key resistance level at the $0.000008000 mark, hitting its highest point since June 15 in the process.
 
 
Another reason for today’s action appears to be the relative strength index (RSI) moving above a ceiling at 55.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at the 60.09 level, which is marginally below a ceiling at 61.00.
 
Should bulls manage to race past this point, there is a good chance the next target price will be $0.000008500.
 
 
Tron (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) extended a recent bull run for a fourth day, with today’s move taking the token to its highest point since last Sunday.
 
Following a low of $0.08221 on Thursday, TRX/USD climbed to an intraday high of $0.08417 earlier in today’s session.
 
Tron bulls appear to be targeting a resistance level at $0.0860, which was last hit during last Saturday’s peak of $0.0943.
 
 
Since hitting that 20-month high TRX has mostly consolidated, however bullish momentum seems to be gradually returning.
 
This comes after the relative strength index (RSI) moved beyond a ceiling of its own at 63.00, and is now tracking at 64.84.
 
If current sentiment remains, TRX could reach $0.0860 in the coming days.

He, however, maintained that the SEC was yet to take a decision, having previously expressed disappointment over the ruling stating that the agency intends to evaluate the ruling in the Ripple Labs lawsuit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin remained above a key support point on Friday, despite bears attempting to push the price below $29,000. Today’s session saw sentiment once again shift bearish, as U.S. consumer sentiment data looms. Ethereum was mostly unchanged in today’s session. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade above the $29,000 mark on Friday, despite bearish pressure intensifying in today’s session.
 
After hitting a high of $29,520.71 on Thursday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $29,099.35 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw bitcoin briefly fall below a support point at $29,200, however prices have since climbed back above this point.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
This latest slippage comes as the 10-day (red) moving average continued its downward cross versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) neared a breakout below a floor at 41.00, however it has so far avoided this.
 
Should this take place, the next possible destination for BTC could be $28,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) traded above its own support point at $1,850 on Friday, as the cryptocurrency continued consolidating.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,855.32 earlier in today’s session, a day after peaking at $1,878.43.
 
The price consolidation comes as the RSI failed to move above a current resistance level at 48.00.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
As of writing, the index is on the cusp of crossing this line, however momentum is still relatively weak.
 
There could likely be a spark later in the day, depending on how traders react to the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report.
