The decision follows a partial summary judgment and short-term victory for Ripple and XRP holders, handed down by Judge Torres in a case that commenced in December 2020.
 
The court’s ruling acknowledged that Ripple’s institutional XRP sales were deemed an unregistered securities offering. 
 
 
However, the judgment found that programmatic sales of XRP did not fall under the same classification. As a result, the trial will focus on determining the regulatory status of XRP and its impact on the cryptocurrency industry.

With blockchain transactions inherently designed to provide anonymity, authorities have often found themselves at an impasse when tracing illicit crypto activities. 
 
However, a recent development in Canada has shown a breakthrough in this standoff, illustrating a potential model for global law enforcement. Particularly, Canadian police have incorporated advanced technology into their investigative procedures, enabling them to delve deeper into the blockchain realm. 
 
Through specialized software, they can now trace blockchain transactions to their source, identify perpetrators, and pinpoint the exact destination of funds.
