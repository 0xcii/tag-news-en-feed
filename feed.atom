The SEC has decided to dismiss the charges with prejudice, signaling a significant setback for the government agency.
 
This dismissal marks the third win in a row for Garlinghouse, Larsen, and Ripple. The streak began with the July 2023 summary judgment, which delivered the most crucial victory, stating, “XRP is not, in and of itself a security” and continued through October when the SEC’s plea for an interlocutory appeal was turned down.
 
Reflecting on the prolonged legal battle, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse remarked, “For nearly three years, Chris and I have been the subject o…]]></summary>

Peter Schiff: ‘Bitcoin Is Nothing’
Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Europac, has railed against the utility and scarcity traits attributed to Bitcoin. In a recent post in X (formerly known as Twitter), Schiff stressed that Bitcoin had no purpose and that its advocates resembled a cult.
Schiff stated:
No one needs Bitcoin. So people only buy it after someone else talks them into doing so. Then once they buy, they immediately try to convince others to buy too. It’s like a cult.

Bitcoin briefly dipped but eventually recovered, surging over 3% to approach the halfway mark to the key $30,000 level. Ethereum also saw a 2% increase but remained below $1,600, while most alternative cryptocurrencies were trading higher in the morning.
