Ethereum Investors Overwhelming In The Green After ETF Rally
 
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, ETH’s latest rally has meant that a shift in investor profitability has occurred on the network.
 
To keep track of holder profitability, the analytics firm makes use of on-chain data to find what the average acquisition price or cost basis of each address on the blockchain is.
 
 
If this price is less than the current spot value of the cryptocurrency for any address, then that particular investor is considered to be in profit, or “in the money”, as IntoTheBlock defines.

Amid this optimism, Daniel Yan, co-founder of Matrixport, has proposed a strategic pivot for investors, suggesting a focus on Solana (SOL) in relation to Ethereum.
 
Is Solana The Next In Line?
 
In a post on X, Yan dissected the immediate market reactions to major ETF approvals and provided a strategic analysis for potential future moves. His insights draw from the historical market behavior observed following the spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF approval.

After all, it's a ledger, decentralized, and wherever we each fall on the political spectrum, we all need to keep track of our own funds. That’s not to say everyone thinks Bitcoin is the best way to do this, but the neutrality of the technology itself looked like an area on which it was easy to find agreement.
 But recently, that sense of being removed from political partisanship has been called into question in the United States, where increasingly, attitudes towards cryptocurrencies appear to be dividing along party lines as we head towards the presidential election. And what’s more, this might be shaping up to be the first US election in which crypto is a significant issue influencing voter decisions.
