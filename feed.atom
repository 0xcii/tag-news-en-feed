        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-extends-bull-run-jumping-5-on-thursday/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-18T16:10:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp rose for a fifth straight session on Thursday, as the token moved close to a two-week high. The rise comes as cryptocurrencies rebounded from recent losses, with the global market cap up 1.38% as of writing. Cardano also surged, hitting an 11-day peak.
 
XRP
 
Xrp, formerly ripple, was once again a big mover in cryptocurrency markets, climbing by as much as 5% on Thursday.
 
Following a low of $0.4389 on Wednesday, XRP/USD rose to a peak of $0.4713 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of this surge, the token moved to its strongest point since April 30, when price was above $0.4800.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that this latest rise comes as the relative strength index (RSI) moved beyond a key resistance level at 55.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is at the 55.71 mark, with the next visible ceiling at the 61.00 point.
 
If bulls were to take the RSI to this point, there is a good chance that XRP could recapture the $0.4800 level.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
In addition to XRP, cardano (ADA) also rose significantly, hitting an 11-day high in today’s session.
 
ADA/USD jumped to an intraday high of $0.3798 earlier today, which follows on from Wednesday’s low at $0.3658.
 
This has resulted in the token climbing for a third consecutive day, reaching its strongest level since May 7.
 
 
Overall, cardano is up by as much as 7% in the past week, this coming as the 10-day (red) moving average begins to gain momentum.
 
Should the trend line continue to climb in its current direction, a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart is highly likely.
 
For this to happen the RSI will need to break out of a ceiling at 47.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a report from The Block, Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency lending company that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year, had attempted to raise $1 billion for a project called Celsius Web Services (CWS).
 
 
CWS aimed to offer generic versions of Celsius’s yield and custody-focused products and was described as a “web3 toolbox for a New World” in pitch decks presented to Goldman Sachs and Abu Dhabi-backed fund ADQ May and June 2021, respectively.
 
 
Former Celsius CEO’s Plan
 
Celsius’s former CEO, Alex Mashinsky, spearheaded the CWS plan, but the project failed to get off the ground as investors, including Celsius’s board, chose not to participate.

He's also figuring out how to upend what it means to be a music fan. The band launched a Deathbats Club NFT collection in 2021. That is to say: They were early.
