        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s hashrate has continued its recent climb, riding to dramatic new highs. The leading digital asset by market cap has experienced a major bull run, bringing about positive sentiment. This has led to more miners plugging into the Bitcoin network, and a new all-time high of 400 EH/s in the past 48 hours. 
 
Bitcoin Hash Rate Touches New High 
 
The Bitcoin hashrate has been consistently increasing since the beginning of the year. Earlier in the week, the network added 40 EH/s hashrate reaching a peak of 350 EH/s. However, hours after the mining difficulty was adjusted on March 23, the hashrate spiked to astronomical levels. Between March 23rd and March 24th, the bitcoin hashrate recorded a new high of 400 EH/s, according to data from Mempool.

Currently, bitcoin miners have not been deterred by the increases, as the network hashrate has been coasting along at 346 exahash per second (EH/s).
 
Bitcoin Hashrate Remains High Despite Recent 7.56% Difficulty Rise
 
As of writing, there are more than 1,700 blocks left until the next difficulty retarget on April 5, 2023. Despite the difficulty increase on March 23 at block height 782,208, the hashrate remains high, and block intervals are still faster than the 10-minute average. The April 5 change is expected to be about 6.9% higher, as block times have been between nine minutes and 21 seconds and nine minutes and 14 seconds.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-climbs-5-as-ltc-nears-multi-week-high-on-saturday/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-25T14:38:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto asset xrp rose by as much as 5% on Saturday, following declines of a similar amount during yesterday’s session. This comes despite the global crypto market cap moving lower, falling by 0.51% at the time of writing. Litecoin was also higher to start the weekend.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was back in the green on Saturday, as the token rebounded from Friday’s losses.
 
Following a low of $0.418, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4501 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move came as bullish momentum increased at the price floor of $0.4250, after bears failed to sustain an earlier breakout.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the rebound took place as the relative strength index (RSI) moved away from its own support, at 58.00
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 60.77, and seems to be heading towards a ceiling at the 63.00 mark.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average has also extended its upward cross versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could be a sign of upcoming gains.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC), was another notable mover to start the weekend, as prices remained close to a multi-week high.
 
LTC/USD climbed to a peak of $93.97 on Saturday, which comes less than 24 hours after a low of $89.87.
 
As a result of this, litecoin is now trading close to a ceiling of $94.00, and a recent three-week high of $96.11.
 
 
One catalyst for the rally was a recent crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
In addition to this, the RSI is now tracking at 57.07, which is marginally above a resistance level of 56.00.
 
Should bullish momentum continue to rise, there is a strong possibility that LTC will move beyond $100.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved close to a breakout below $27,000 on Saturday, as markets moved lower following a volatile week of trading. Market uncertainty was high this week, as traders digested the latest Federal Reserve interest rate hike, as well as the on-going global banking crisis. Ethereum remains below $1,800 as of writing.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the weekend consolidating below the $28,000 mark, as market volatility eased on Saturday .
 
Following a high of $28,208.21 on Friday, BTC/USD moved to an intraday low of $27,039.27 earlier today.
 
As a result of the move, bitcoin collided with a floor at the $27,050 level, however bulls have so far rejected a breakout below this point.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s sell-off took place as the relative strength index (RSI) fell below a floor of its own, at the 65.00 mark.
 
As of writing this, the index is now tracking at the 62.75 level, with the next visible point of support at the 60.00 mark..
 
Overall, BTC has rebounded from earlier lows, and at the time of writing, is trading at $27,475.15.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also edged lower to start the weekend, as prices continued to fall from a recent seven-month high.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,730.35 in today’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $1,791.14.
 
The move pushed ethereum to its long-term floor at $1,730, with buys opting to buy the dip at the point.
 
 
This recent drop in price has pushed ethereum’s RSI to its lowest point in two-week, with a current reading of 55.39.
 
Momentum still remains marginally bullish, as seen by the 10-day (red) moving average, however should prices move below $1,730, that could change.

In addition, the governor said the Central Bank of Nigeria’s stringent guidelines help to create a “very safe” banking system. 
 
Priority Given to Depositors
 
According to the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, a recent review of Nigerian banks’ bond portfolios showed that the country’s financial institutions had no direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Emefiele, who made the remarks during a meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee, added that the central bank’s so-called prudential guidelines help to ensure that only healthy banks are allowed to operate.
 
Some of the guidelines and considerations used by the CBN include banks’ non-performing loans (NPL), which averaged 4.2%, and the capital adequacy ratio of 13.7%. According to Emefiele, these ratios, as well as the banks’ average liquidity and loan-to-deposit ratios of 43% and 52% respectively, indicate that Nigerian banks are “very safe.”
 

 
Also, in his remarks published by Nairametrics, Emefiele implied that the central bank has and will always prioritize bank customers.
 
“We will rather dispose of shareholders than make depositors lose money,” Emefiele said.
 
To support this claim, Emefiele is quoted in the report stating no Nigerian depositor has lost money to a failed bank since 2003.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former U.S. National Football League (NFL) quarterback Tom Brady’s estranged wife Gisele Bundchen has said she was “blindsided” by the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Bundchen claimed that she only invested in FTX because her financial advisors recommended it. 
 
Bundchen and Brady’s Shareholding in FTX
 
Gisele Bundchen, a fashion model and the estranged wife of former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, has said she only invested in Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX because her financial advisors told her to do so. In remarks published in the Daily Mail, Bundchen suggested that she, just like other FTX investors, was “blindsided” by the crypto exchange’s spectacular collapse.
 
According to the Daily Mail, the celebrity model reportedly held more than 680,000 shares in the collapsed crypto exchange, which were at one point valued at $57 million. Brady, on the other hand, held more than 1.1 million FTX shares when the crypto exchange collapsed. Besides being a shareholder, Bundchen was the crypto exchange’s ambassador and just like Brady, she also appeared in FTX’s Super Bowl advertisement.
 

 
Bundchen Says She Wants Justice for FTX Victims
 
After FTX abruptly stopped operating, Bundchen and other celebrities were accused of engaging in deceptive practices. In a billion-dollar lawsuit filed by attorneys Adam Moskowitz and David Boies in Nov. 2022, Oklahoma resident Edwin Garrison also accused the celebrities of promoting unregistered securities.
 
However, despite her role in promoting the crypto exchange, as well as her perceived closeness to Bankman-Fried, Bundchen is quoted in the report claiming she too wants justice to prevail.
 
“It’s just…terrible. I’m so sorry for all of us that this happened, and I just pray that justice gets made,” the fashion model reportedly said.
