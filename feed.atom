Over the past seven months, the platform has maintained an unusually high uptime of 100%, shaking off criticism that has plagued the network over the years since launching.
 
Solana Has Been Online For 7 Straight Months
 
Accordingly, with this milestone, Solana is now close to achieving the longest streak of uninterrupted periods in a row. Overall, this highlights the progress made by the platform to ensure stability and reliability. Theoretically, Solana, like Ethereum and other public ledgers, is supposed to maintain a high uptime of over 99.9% due to their architecture.

The analyst suggested that Dogecoin will outperform Bitcoin in the ongoing market cycle due to the follower effect, with Bitcoin laying the groundwork for the meme coin. 
 
This comes even as Bitcoin has had the lion’s share of investments and new inflow into the crypto industry since the beginning of the year due to increased institutional investments. This has seen Bitcoin outperforming most altcoins, with Ethereum, the king of altcoins, especially struggling to keep up.
