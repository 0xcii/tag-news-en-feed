        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the latest development in the ongoing FTX saga, federal prosecutors have charged Michelle Bond, the domestic partner of former FTX executive Ryan Salame, with violating campaign finance laws. This comes just a day after Salame made a last-ditch effort to have his conviction vacated or blocked.

Notably, the Jackson Hole symposium comes on the heels of yesterday’s historic US Bureau of Labour Statistics US job revision. US job additions were revised lower by 818,000, the largest revision since 2009. This major revision underscores a softening labor market—a crucial factor for monetary policy considerations, just as inflation rates began to show signs of abating, with the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropping from 3.9% in December 2023 to 3.2% in July.
