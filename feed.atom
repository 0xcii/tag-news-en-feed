        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stake, an Australian crypto casino renowned for the integration of crypto assets into gambling, has fallen victim to a recent alleged exploit. 
 
On-chain analysis firm Cyvers revealed that a jaw-dropping $16 million was siphoned off from the Ethereum network due to a “private key leak.” 
 
The suspicious nature of the transfers, involving the swap of Tether’s USDT to Ethereum (ETH), has raised eyebrows and triggered an extensive investigation. 
 
As the probe expands to other chains, losses of $17.8 million on the BNB Chain and $7.8 million on the Polygon Proof of Stake (PoS) chain have been discovered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto betting platform Stake.com confirmed on Sept. 4 that an unknown entity had carried out unauthorised transactions from its ethereum and Binance Smartchain hot wallets. However, the crypto-betting platform insisted that user funds were safe and that its other hot wallets remain operational. 
 
Digital Assets Worth More Than $40 Million Reportedly Stolen
 
Stake.com, one of the leading crypto-betting platforms, confirmed on Sept. 4 that “unauthorised [transactions]” were made from its ETH and BSC hot wallets. The betting platform said an investigation into the apparent hacking incident is currently underway and the hot wallets will only get back up “as soon as they’re completely re-secured.”
 
 
Three hours ago, unauthorised tx’s were made from Stake’s ETH/BSC hot wallets.
 
We are investigating and will get the wallets up as soon as they’re completely re-secured.
 
User funds are safe.
 
BTC, LTC, XRP, EOS, TRX + all other wallets remain fully operational.
 
— Stake.com (@Stake) September 4, 2023
 

 
The crypto-betting platform’s confirmation of the hacking came a few hours after users of X (formerly Twitter) claimed that Stake.com had lost digital assets worth millions of dollars. The online sleuth Zachxbt suggested that hackers had initially stolen assets worth close to $16 million before siphoning another lot worth over $25 million.
 
However, in a statement issued on X, Stake.com, which is “approved” by Canadian singer and celebrity Drake, claimed that user funds were safe. It added that BTC, LTC, XRP, EOS, TRX, and all other wallets are operational.
 
Commenting on the incident, Stake.com co-founder Ed Craven said:
 

Stake keeps a small portion of its crypto reserves in hot wallets at any given moment for these very reasons. All affected wallets should be operational shortly.
 
However, Craven, just like the crypto-betting platform, did not reveal the value of the stolen digital assets.

Schiermeyer’s lawsuit claims that GALA tokens were initially moved to a wallet under the company’s control. However, things took a nefarious turn when Thurston allegedly transferred these tokens into 43 different wallets. When questioned about these actions, Thurston purportedly asserted that he was safeguarding the tokens for Gala’s benefit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stellar surged by as much as 7% on Monday, despite sentiment in crypto markets being mostly bearish to start the week. The token rallied for a second straight session, after a recent collision with a key price floor. Toncoin also rose, hitting a fresh multi-month high. 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
XLM was one of Monday’s biggest movers, as the cryptocurrency rose by as much as 7% in today’s session.
 
After trading at a low of $0.1147 on Sunday, XLM/USD moved to an intraday peak of $0.126 earlier in the day.
 
This surge sees stellar climb higher for a second consecutive day, following a rebound from a floor at $0.110.
 
 
Earlier gains have already begun to ease, which comes due to the relative strength index (RSI) colliding with a ceiling of 49.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 49.48, with the next point of resistance around 54.00.
 
Overall, bulls seem to have set their sights on the $0.135 level.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) also moved higher to start the week, with the token hitting a fresh multi-month high in the process.
 
TON/USD peaked at $1.93 on Labor Day, which comes following a low of $1.85 during Sunday’s session.
 
As a result of the move, toncoin climbed to its strongest point since May 8, when the price reached a high of $2.08.
 
 
The RSI on TON continues to reside over the 70.00 mark, meaning that price strength remains overbought.
 
This has not prevented bulls from continuing to send the token higher, with the $2.00 level the perceived target for traders.
