A former function of money that is no longer possible due to decades of monetary inflation that has decimated people's purchasing power. This development coincides with the "Nixon shock" of August 15, 1971, when U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that the U.S. would end the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold. Since then, central banks around the world have started operating a fiat-based monetary system with floating exchange rates and no real currency standard.

The roadmap Lucie laid out centers around decentralization and community empowerment, aiming to shift the governance of Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain, towards a more democratic and participatory model.
 
‘Big Plan’ For Shiba Inu In 2024/2025
 
Lucie’s tweet outlined several core objectives, with “More Power to Everyone” at the forefront, indicating a move to spread decision-making across the Shiba Inu community. This approach aims to dilute central control, ostensibly giving each token holder a stake in governance decisions.

first cryptocurrency, is a topic of debate and speculation in the financial  
world. Bitcoin has continually demonstrated endurance and growth since its  
creation, despite its well-known price volatility and occasional setbacks. 
For starters,  
Bitcoin's allure stems from its scarcity and cyclical halving events. It is a  
deflationary digital asset with a predefined supply cap of 21 million Bitcoins.  
This scarcity distinguishes it from ordinary fiat currencies, which central  
banks can produce at will. The occurrence of Bitcoin halving events every four  
years slows the production of new Bitcoins. Historical data shows that these  
halvings are frequently followed by significant price increases as the reduced  
supply collides with continuing demand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin bull Cathie Wood believes gold's time has come and gone.
The CEO of Ark Invest weighed in on the enduring debate between the traditional safe haven asset and digital currency during a recent Bloomberg UK podcast, Merryn Talks Money. 
In a hypothetical scenario where Wood had to choose between holding gold, a cash deposit account, or Bitcoin for a decade, she made her stance clear.
"It's a hedge against inflation and deflation. It's digital," she began, passionately advocating for Bitcoin. Wood acknowledged the time-tested appeal of gold but highlighted a crucial difference. "Gold already has its demand; it's happened," she explained. In contrast, she emphasized that Bitcoin remains a fresh and evolving asset, with institutions only beginning to scratch the surface of its potential.
Wood's perspective aligns with the prevailing sentiment among younger investors who increasingly favor Bitcoin over gold. She pointed out that Bitcoin's allure lies in its technological novelty and the rising enthusiasm from millennials and Gen Z, who see it as a more attractive store of value compared to the yellow metal.
Intriguingly, Wood made a notable observation regarding the role of both gold and Bitcoin as hedges against deflation. However, she noted that Bitcoin's recent performance suggests that it has been outshining its traditional counterpart.
In summary, Wood's sentiment reflects the evolving landscape of investments, with Bitcoin emerging as a powerful contender.

First, it finds out the 30-day net position change in the “realized cap” of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The realized cap here refers to a capitalization model that calculates the total valuation of an asset by assuming that the price at which each token was last moved on the chain is its true value.
