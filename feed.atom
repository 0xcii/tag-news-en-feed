        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-pepe-13-higher-as-coin-breaks-out-of-key-resistance-level/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-07T15:41:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pepe rose by as much as 13% in today’s session, with the coin breaking out of a key resistance level as a result. The surge came as cryptocurrency markets attempted to bounce back from Tuesday’s drubbing. XRP was another notable gainer, moving 5% higher on Wednesday. 
 
Pepe (PEPE)
 
Pepe (PEPE), which is known for being a deflationary meme coin, rose by over 13% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $0.0000009764 on Tuesday, PEPE/USD made a move to a peak of $0.000001257 earlier today.
 
As a result of the move, pepe briefly broke out of a price ceiling at $0.000001200, however was unable to sustain the move.
 
 
At the time of writing, the coin is currently trading at $0.000001135, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) sits below its own ceiling.
 
The index is tracking at 49.15, which is marginally below a key level of resistance at the 53.00 mark.
 
Should bulls push past this point, there is a good chance that PEPE will make another move above $0.000001200.
 

 
XRP
 
In addition to PEPE, XRP also made strong gains during Wednesday’s session, with price jumping by as much as 5%.
 
XRP/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.5371 earlier in the day, which comes following Tuesday’s low at $0.4982.
 
Today’s rally saw the token formerly known as ripple briefly break through a ceiling at $0.5330.
 
 
Historically, this level has birthed significant bearish pressure, which seems to be why earlier bulls opted to liquidate positions.
 
This comes as the RSI also failed to break its own ceiling at the 63.00 level, and is currently tracking at 62.53.
 
In the event that bulls eventually surge beyond this point, the next target will likely be $0.6000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded from a near three-month low on Wednesday, as traders moved to buy the latest price dip. Yesterday’s decline came as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued both Binance and Coinbase. Ethereum moved closer to $1,900 in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) bounced back above the $27,000 level on Wednesday, as traders moved to buy the recent dip in price.
 
Following a low of $25,434.87 on Tuesday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $27,332.18 in today’s session.
 
This move saw bitcoin climb away from its weakest point since March 17, when it was at a low of $24,946.

Overall, price has also risen back above a key support point at $26,300, with the relative strength index (RSI) hovering near a similar area.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 45.67, which is below a resistance level of 47.00.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average also remains above its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could be a positive sign for longer-term bulls.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also made strong gains in today’s session, with prices closing in on a reentry above the $1,900 level.
 
ETH/USD hit a peak of $1,896.22 on Wednesday, which comes less than 24 hours after the price was below $1,800.
 
Tuesday’s decline sent ethereum to its weakest point since May 25, which was the last time the cryptocurrency was at a floor at $1,790.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that today’s rebound came as the RSI bounced from its own floor at 44.00.
 
The index is now tracking at 51.16, with the next visible point of resistance being at the 53.00 mark.
