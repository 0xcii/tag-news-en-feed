        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While several top digital assets have decreased in value against the U.S. dollar over the past month, the stablecoin economy has lost $2.4 billion in value since March 31, 2023. Four of the top five stablecoins experienced net redemptions over the last 30 days, except for tether, which grew by 2.3% during that time.
 
Four of the Top Five Stablecoins Experience Net Redemptions in the Past 30 Days
 
On March 31, 2023, the top stablecoins by market capitalization represented $133.63 billion in value, and now the valuation is down to $131.21 billion. A total of $2.4 billion worth of stablecoins has been withdrawn from the stablecoin economy since then. Data reveals that over the past 30 days, USDC, BUSD, DAI, and TUSD have all seen redemptions. Usd coin’s (USDC) circulating supply dropped 10.2% compared to last month, and binance usd (BUSD) fell by 20.6%. Of the top five largest stablecoins, both USDC and BUSD experienced the most redemptions.
 
 
Further, DAI’s circulating supply slipped 9% lower in 30 days and TUSD’s supply decreased by 0.7%. Tether (USDT), however, grew 2.3% since last month, reaching a market capitalization worth $81.39 billion. Tether’s market valuation accounts for 61.65% of the entire stablecoin economy’s $131.21 billion value. While tether’s supply grew by 2.3%, pax dollar (USDP) rose by 33.9% since last month.
 
 
USDP now has a market valuation of approximately $1,037,832,268. Both frax dollar and Tron’s USDD experienced losses during the past 30 days; frax dollar (FRAX) shed 3.8% while USDD lost 1% of its circulating supply. Gemini’s dollar-pegged token GUSD saw its supply increase by 18.1% to $465.22 million. Liquity usd (LUSD) recorded a 2.4% rise, and magic internet money (MIM) increased by 5.9% last month. The entire stablecoin economy represents 11.02% of the crypto economy’s $1.19 trillion net value.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon fell to a six-week low on Tuesday, with sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remaining bearish. The price plunged as consumer confidence in the United States fell by more than expected, coming in at a reading of 101.3 in April. Solana also slipped, hitting a two-week low.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) dropped to a six-week low on Tuesday, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remained bearish.
 
MATIC/USD dropped for a third straight session, hitting an intraday low of $0.9633 in the process.
 
The move came less than a day after polygon was trading at a peak of $1.01, with today’s fall sending it to its weakest point since March 10.
 
 
As a result of the sell-off, it appears that MATIC bears are targeting a floor at the $0.95 mark.
 
From the chart, one of the catalysts for the drop seems to be a breakout that occurred on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
The index fell below a floor at 32.00, and is currently tracking at 31.13, which is its lowest reading since last June.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was another notable mover on Tuesday, as the token moved closer to a floor at $20.00.
 
Following a high of $21.95 to start the week, SOL/USD dropped to a low of $20.92 earlier in today’s session.
 
Today’s slippage sent solana to its lowest level since April 11, when price fell to a bottom at $20.83.
 
 
At the time of writing, SOL has somewhat risen from its earlier low, and is currently trading at $20.95.
 
In addition to this, the RSI indicator continues to track near a floor at 42.00, with a present reading of 42.66.
 
Should it fall below this point of support, it is highly likely that solana will drop below $20.00.

While April 2023 has been an eventful month for the crypto industry, the news about Daniel’s indictment by South Korean prosecutors was met with little to no surprise.
 
Do Kwon, founder of Terraform Labs and Daniel Shin’s partner, was reportedly arrested last month in Montenegro on charges of capital markets violation and fraud, as reported by Bloomberg. 
 
Since the TerraLuna crash, Do Kwon has been in the limelight of multiple controversies and is currently wanted in the US.

He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex.

Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
