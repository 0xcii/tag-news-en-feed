        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thailand has joined the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) trend by approving One Asset Management (ONEAM) to launch a Bitcoin ETF, as reported by the Bangkok Post. However, access to the instrument will be limited to wealthy and institutional investors.
Thailand’s Bitcoin ETF
As approved by the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ETF is named the ONE Bitcoin ETF Fund of Funds Unhedged and is scheduled to be distributed between May 31 and June 6. The Bitcoin ETF comes with an investment risk level of eight.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Realizing Much Fewer Profits Now
 
As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the BTC short-term holders have been realizing much lower amounts of profits recently. The “short-term holders” (STHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days.
 
Statistically, the longer an investor holds their coins, the less likely they become to sell them. As the STHs are the new entrants in the market, they are unlikely to hold for too long.

Per the post, the investor received several notifications from Binance about orders being filled out. The customer quickly checked his account and contacted support before his balance went to $0. While trying to get assistance, he helplessly observed how his funds rapidly disappeared.

Post-Halving Price Movements: A Historical Insight
 
The premier cryptocurrency has historically shown significant price movements post-halving, with most substantial gains typically occurring 12 to 18 months after the event.
 
Palihapitiya points out that while the price tends to show modest increases initially, substantial surges have followed previous Halvings. For instance, the first Halving led to a more than tenfold in…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia now officially has its first spot Bitcoin ETF that directly holds BTC. The Monochrome Asset Management's Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) just began trading as the Cboe Australia exchange opened. Trading under the ticker IBTC, the ETF carries a management fee of 0.98%.

BREAKING: 🇦🇺 Australia's first spot #Bitcoin ETF to hold #BTC directly officially begins trading. pic.twitter.com/k4OPyPDm5O
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 4, 2024
  
  
  
This milestone makes IBTC the first fund in the country to offer direct Bitcoin holdings, providing investors with straightforward access to BTC. This new product stands apart from the two existing spot Bitcoin ETFs in Australia, which provide exposure to spot Bitcoin without holding Bitcoin directly. Monochrome's ETF fills this gap, by providing an ETF that actually holds Bitcoin.
“Before IBTC, Australian investors were only able to invest in ETFs that indirectly hold bitcoin or through offshore bitcoin products, both of which don’t benefit from the investor protection rules under the directly held crypto asset Australian Financial Services Licensing (AFSL) licensing regime,” the company stated.
This development in Australia follows the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year. These ETFs have seen considerable success, reflecting strong investor interest and confidence in Bitcoin. Additionally, Bitcoin ETPs have gone live on the London Stock Exchange, and Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Commodities (ETCs) have gone live in Germany as well, further highlighting the global trend towards accessible Bitcoin investment products.]]></summary>
