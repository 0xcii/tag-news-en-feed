has made a comeback in the cryptocurrency space after filing for insolvency in  
August and returning customer funds. The relaunch focuses on its core business  
of buying and selling cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. 
Bitwala and Striga Partnership
Bitwala, a cryptocurrency service  
under Nuri, is now operating in 29 countries within the European Economic Area  
(EEA), offering users access to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The platform has shed its  
previous licensing and regulatory burdens by utilizing an out-of-the-box compliant  
infrastructure package from Striga, a departure from its reliance on  
Solarisbank in the past.
Future plans for Bitwala include

rules for the regulation of cryptocurrency and stablecoin markets. The European  
Banking Authority (EBA) has proposed minimum capital and liquidity requirements  
for issuers of stablecoins and other digitized tokens.
The EBA's proposal, published today (Wednesday), is  
designed to ensure that issuers of stablecoins backed by currencies have  
sufficient funds for investors to redeem in case of losses. This move aims to  
establish a framework for the stablecoin industry and provide safeguards  
against potential crises.
Key to the proposed regulations is the requirement  
for issuers to maintain liquidity for the reserve of assets that back the  
stablecoin reserves. These assets must meet specific criteria, ensuring their

This movement from the authorities towards understanding and incorporating crypto is most apparent in the EU, through MiCA: a work in progress, but still, the world’s first comprehensive framework for meaningful crypto regulation.
