        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silicon Valley giant Meta, formerly known as Facebook, is back in the crypto spotlight after a quiet filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) hinted at renewed ambitions in the digital asset space. This comes as a surprise, considering Meta’s previous assurances to Congress of halting all cryptocurrency-related endeavors.
 
 
Crypto Trademark Shift Sparks Congressional Concerns
 
The company submitted five trademark applications encompassing a range of blockchain and crypto-related services, from social networking to trading platforms. This sudden shift has raised eyebrows, particularly on Capitol Hill. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has fired off a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Javier Olivan demanding answers.

A judge in Colorado has since ordered the closure of the pastor and his wife’s bank accounts for 14 days. 
 
‘The Lord Brought This Cryptocurrency to Me’
 
The securities regulator in Colorado has charged Reverend Eli Regalado, creator of the cryptocurrency INDX coin and pastor of the online-only Victorious Grace Church, with selling “worthless” INDX coins for $3.4 million sometime in 2022 and during the first half of 2023. Tung Chan, Colorado’s securities commissioner, filed a lawsuit on Jan. 16, accusing Regalado of ensuring that investors in his coin did not recoup their investment.

This continues the crypto token’s decline, which began around the time the Spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved. Interestingly, a recent development indicates that the defunct crypto exchange FTX has greatly contributed to this price dump. 
 
Why Bitcoin Dropped Below $40,000
 
According to a Bloomberg report, FTX sold off a majority of its shares in Grayecale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) after the Bitcoin ETF conversion. This means that it has partly contributed to Grayscale’s unending BTC sales in a bid to fulfill these redemptions. Grayscale’s move in the market is believed to be the reason why Bitcoin’s price has continued to plummet.
