XRP Holders To Face Harsh Reality
 
Recent developments in the XRPL ecosystem, specifically the departure of two significant validator operators, have ignited discussions and debates in the XRP community. Responding to these events, Mobarak took to X (formerly Twitter) to express criticism over Ripple’s management of its ecosystem and the current declined state of the XRP token.
