SHIB, on the other hand, is currently struggling with bearish price action as the bulls find themselves outnumbered by the bears.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Distribution Appears To Be Ending
 
As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the BTC long-term holders are currently showcasing a trend that’s reminiscent of 2021.
 
The “long-term holders” (LTHs) are Bitcoin investors who have been keeping their coins dormant (that is, not transferring or selling them from their wallet) for more than 155 days.
 
 
Generally, the longer a holder keeps their coins still, the less likely they are to move them at any point. As such, the LTHs, with their long holding times, are considered the market’s resolute hands.

Dogecoin To $2 And XRP To $3
 
Chasse mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin will climb to $2 and XRP to $3. His prediction for Dogecoin stands out given that other crypto analysts like Altcoin Sherpa have predicted that $1 is the highest level the crypto token can attain in this bull run. As such, Chasse’s prediction undoubtedly increases expectations for the meme coin in this cycle.
