Deaton has unleashed a broadside against what he perceives as systemic corruption, favoritism, and a glaring double standard in the regulatory oversight of cryptocurrencies. Deaton’s fiery response, articulated through via X, was triggered by a commentary from his colleague, James “MetaLawMan” Murphy, regarding the SEC’s recent hearings involving major crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance.
 
Murphy’s initial observation pointed out a significant omission in the SEC’s narrative, “The SEC touted the benefits of the guidance it had given about how to analyze whether crypto tokens are securities.

A new blockchain venture capital (VC) fund, Paper Ventures, has been launched with an initial fund of $25 million earmarked for investment in early-stage Web3 and blockchain projects.

According to a statement, Danish Chaudhry, Oliver Blakey, and Ivailo Jordanov are the founders of Paper Ventures. The three are experienced in investing in Web3 projects.
 
Some of the projects which the trio helped to secure early funding include Frax Finance, SEI, Polygon, Injective, Polkadot, Moonbeam and Cosmos.
 
 
Commenting on the launch of the fund, co-founder Blakey, a former poker pro, said:
 
“We are more than just investors. Our mission at Paper Ventures is to be at the very forefront of innovation, fostering groundbreaking ideas that redefine the boundaries of technology and finance. We believe in the transformative power of blockchain and are committed to supporting those who are as passionate about its potential as we are.”
