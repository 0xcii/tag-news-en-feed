        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto industry is buzzing this year, not just because of new memes, coin pumping, or Bitcoin leading another bull run. It’s now a hotly debated election issue, dividing the electorate and promising to bring the industry to new heights. And we’re not just talking about the US elections and Trump’s pro-crypto stance; digital currency as an election issue has spilled over to Japan, where it’s scheduled to hold its general elections this October 27th.
 
 
Yuichiro Tamaki, the leader of the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), has recently promised tax cuts and reforms as part of the party’s efforts to shore up support. Posting on his official Twitter/X account, Tamaki shared that his party is pursuing crypto-friendly tax policies, offering tax cuts of up to 20%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a stark critique of the European Central Bank’s latest research, prominent analyst Tuur Demeester has labeled the ECB’s new publication as a “true declaration of war” against Bitcoin. The ECB’s paper, titled “The Distributional Consequences of Bitcoin,” authored by Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf, has ignited a fervent response from the BTC community.
 
The ECB’s paper challenges the foundational premise of Bitcoin by arguing that its appreciation does not contribute to the productive capacity of the economy. Instead, the paper posits that a sustained increase in BTC’s value leads to redistributive effects, where the consumption and wealth accumulation of early holders potentially impoverish non-holders and latecomers.
