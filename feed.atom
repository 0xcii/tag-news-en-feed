Nigeria is the first African nation to launch a sovereign digital currency. After the launch, the project suffered a low adoption rate from the citizens. But the recent cash shortage stemming from new financial policies and cash withdrawal limits has forced citizens to utilize digital solutions.
 
eNaira Now Gaining Relevance
 
Godwin Emefiele, Nigeria’s CBN governor, stated that the CBN minted over 10 billion eNaira, and nearly 3.4 billion is in circulation. Also, the Nigerian government is fueling the adoption of this digital currency, using it for payments under the Nigerian social scheme. This scheme is for poor Nigerians and has…]]></summary>

The White House has released the extensive “Economic Report of the President,” which included a section titled “Digital Assets: Relearning Economic Principles.” This section detailed Bitcoin, its functionality and various “possible benefits that proponents claim for this popularity of crypto assets.” 
The proponent’s claims the report intends to address vary from crypto assets serving as investment vehicles and enabling fast digital payments, to improving the United States’ current financial technology infrastructure.

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/first-ever-bitcoin-themed-pez-dispenser-to-launch-in-2023"/>
        <updated>2023-03-22T18:39:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PEZ dispenser with a Bitcoin design has released in a limited-edition run of 30,000 units.

A Bitcoin-themed PEZ dispenser has officially launched.
Only 30,000 units will be produced. 
The scarcity of units is meant to both mirror the scarcity of bitcoin and create the first Bitcoin-themed candy collectible. 

The world’s first Bitcoin-themed PEZ dispenser has launched for a limited-edition run, per a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. 
ProSnacktive Sales, a newly formed family-owned business, launched the product exclusively on Walmart Marketplace. The company is producing a hard limit of 30,000 units, mirroring the hard money scarcity of bitcoin.
 
 
         
         
         
         
    
“We believe the future is bright for Bitcoin, and that is one of the main reasons we pursued this project,” said Chris Coradini, owner of ProSnacktive Sales LLC. “It’s a fun way to promote Bitcoin and leave a long-lasting impression with all crypto, collectible, and candy enthusiasts alike! And yes, bitcoin was used to help fund this project!”
While the markets are suffering a downturn and news of acquisitions, liquidation events and volatile prices crowd investors’ screens, ProSnacktive intends for this product to be a well-deserved break from the market madness.
The company noted that while these PEZ dispensers might not need to be HODLed quite as tightly as one’s bitcoin, they still might be worth holding onto as a collectible. One local Connecticut resident and PEZ collector is already excited for the product launch. 
“It’s awesome to hear that Bitcoin was adopted as a custom PEZ design,” local Connecticut resident Phil Grimaldi said. “I’m definitely going to be buying more Bitcoin before the dispenser goes on sale. I hope I am lucky enough to get one. PEZ and Bitcoin to the moon!]]></summary>

Crypto Investors Are Very Greedy
 
Since 2023 began, crypto investor sentiment has been on a slow but steady uptrend. It finished the year 2022 in the ‘Extreme Fear’ territory which saw prices drop to new cycle lows. However, the change so far has been encouraging as the index has now returned to the ‘Greed’ level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp moved to its highest point since November, as markets reacted to news suggesting a verdict could be near in Ripple’s case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Cardano was also higher on Wednesday, hitting a one-month high.
 
XRP
 
XRP rose to its highest point since November, as markets continued to react to the latest news surrounding Ripple’s case with the SEC.
 
Following a low of $0.4199 on Tuesday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4914 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the strongest point that the token has reached since November 6, when prices were retreating from a high above $0.50.
 
 
Overall, earlier gains have since eased, which comes as bulls failed to sustain a breakout on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 65.14, which is below the aforementioned ceiling at 70.00.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average remains in an uptrend despite the marginal decline, which sees XRP currently trading at $0.4459.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was once again higher in today’s session, as the token jumped to a one-month high.
 
ADA/USD moved to a peak of $0.387 on Wednesday, which comes a day after falling to a low at $0.349.
 
Today’s surge saw bulls push cardano to its highest level since February 23, when price was at a peak of $0.393.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that the climb coincided with the 10-day (red) moving average crossing over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the 14-day RSI is now tracking at 60.93, which is its highest reading since mid-February.
 
A ceiling at 53.00 may await for bulls should momentum continue in this current direction, which could put a stop to the run.
