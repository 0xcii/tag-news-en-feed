        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent report from PwC has highlighted an interesting dynamic: despite an overall decrease in traditional hedge funds’ participation in crypto, confidence in the sector’s long-term prospects seems stronger than ever. Though this might seem counterintuitive, given the current scenario marked by market volatility and regulatory ambiguities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto scams have experienced a significant decline of 77% in the first half of 2023, plummeting from a staggering $3.3 billion to $1.1 billion, as shown in a recent report from blockchain intelligence firm, Chainalysis. 
 
This encouraging trend marks the second consecutive year of decreasing scam revenue, reflecting positive developments in the cryptocurrency landscape. 
 
However, in the face of this decline, Chainalysis also highlighted a concerning rise in ransomware revenues, which have reached $449 million year-to-date and could potentially surge to a staggering $939 million by year’s end. 
 
These findings shed light on the evolving nature of crypto-related crimes and emphasize the importance of staying vigilant in the face of emerging threats.

During a recent webinar, Gensler was pressed about Coinbase’s involvement in the ETF filings. While he refrained from commenting specifically on the filings, his remarks on crypto exchanges and their “conflicting services” and “limited risk monitoring” were far from encouraging. Gensler stated, “What that means is they could be trading directly against you and market making against you, which you would not see, or hope to see on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ.”
