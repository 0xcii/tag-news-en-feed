However, the company continued to operate following a hack that would likely destroy some firms. Three months later, with the hack behind them, it seems Wintermute is back on track. However, not everyone believes that the company is completely out of the woods.
 
The Wintermute “Dumpster-Fire”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin rebounded from Wednesday’s decline, as the meme coin moved away from a key support level. Prices have been hovering close to a two-month low in recent days, with today’s surge bringing optimism to remaining bulls. Litecoin was also higher, as the token remained close to a one-week high.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was in the green on Thursday, as the meme coin rebounded from recent lows.
 
Following a low of $0.07283 on Wednesday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.07736 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move comes as prices rallied, following a recent collision with a support point at the $0.0715 level.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, today’s move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) raced to a ceiling of 40.00.
 
Since this time, earlier gains have somewhat faded, with the meme coin trading at $0.07657 as of writing.
 
Should price strength manage to climb above this threshold, then DOGE could rally to a ceiling near $0.0800.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) also rose on Thursday, as the token continued to trade near a one-week high.
 
LTC/USD hit a peak of $66.51 earlier in today’s session, which comes less than a day after it was residing at a low of $65.09.
 
Today’s high is marginally below Tuesday’s top at $66.90, which was the highest point LTC had hit since last Friday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move comes despite the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) recently extending its downward cross with the 25-day (blue) MA.
 
As of writing, the RSI is tracking at 39.67, which is below the next visible resistance line at 45.00.
 
Bulls will likely target this point, which could see LTC climb above the $70.00 price point.

A judgment in Peter McCormack’s current case against Craig Wright concluded that Wright must pay the court fees of McCormack on an indemnity basis, amongst other findings.
The conclusion of the trial also sets up an inquiry into Wright for contempt of court, with Justice Chamberlain of the Royal Courts of Justice writing, “I will issue a summons requiring Dr. Wright to attend a directions hearing before a judge nominated by the Judge in Charge of the Media and Communications List, who will give directions for the conduct of contempt proceedings in respect of breach of the embargo.”
