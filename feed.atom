        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year the Energy Information Administration attempted to conduct a survey of Bitcoin mining energy use under emergency authorization statues, bypassing the traditional process of instituting a survey that required an open period of comment from the public and industry players subject to the survey. 
This survey attempt was done under very dubious circumstances with very unsound reasoning to justify its emergency nature. Riot Platforms and the Texas Blockchain Council sued to seek an injunction against the survey in Waco, Texas. 
In the final agreement the EIA voluntarily agreed to terminate the collection under the emergency and destroy all information they had received up to the point of the court ruling. 
A new notice was issued following the normal procedure of an open comment period. 
Today at 12:00-1:30 PM Central the EIA is holding a webinar to discuss the issues related to Bitcoin mining energy use, and information associated with mining sites’ operations in the United States. 
People can register here to watch the webinar, and there is a form to submit questions during the registration process to hopefully be addressed during the webinar. 
I would ask as I have in past coverage of the agency's actions related to this space, if you do attend and submit any questions, please be respectful and serious in your engagement.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The City of Santa Monica is making history by opening an official Bitcoin office. The city council unanimously voted to pilot the office in partnership with the nonprofit Proof of Workforce at no cost to the city.

The office has four key goals, as per the PR sent to Bitcoin Magazine: providing Bitcoin education, facilitating partnerships and conferences to grow tourism, connecting residents to jobs, and exploring sustainable Bitcoin mining powered by the city's renewable energy.
Vice Mayor Lana Negrete, who championed the initiative, said, "As we embark on a journey to learn Bitcoin in Santa Monica, I'm excited to see the following ideas. Bitcoin is for everyone!"
Santa Monica is following the model of El Salvador, which became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Since then, El Salvador has opened up a Bitcoin office and attracted significant investment and tourism related to Bitcoin.
By embracing Bitcoin, Santa Monica hopes to replicate some of this success. The city has an annual budget of $700 million and welcomed 4.5 million visitors, spending nearly $1 billion in 2023.
Some other recent Bitcoin developments in Santa Monica include firefighters adopting self-custody of Bitcoin and city leaders visiting El Salvador to study its Bitcoin adoption firsthand.
As more places like Santa Monica explore Bitcoin, it validates the growing view that cities and countries can gain an advantage by positioning themselves as Bitcoin-friendly destinations.
Dom Bei, Founder of Proof of Workforce, said: "The future of Santa Monica is bright orange!" On Wednesday, he plans to present a special Bitcoin visual on the Santa Monica Pier to celebrate the city's new Bitcoin initiative.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cardano-powered sci-fi shooter game Chronoshot was added to the wishlist on the Epic Games Store on Tuesday, marking a remarkable step for the game developer and the ADA ecosystem. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, expressed his excitement about this important milestone, stating, “Cardano Games on Epic makes me happy.”
 
Cardano Based Gaming Is Coming
 
Chronoshot introduces a novel game mechanic where time only progresses when the player moves. This allows players to actively strategize, place shots and plan moves against the opponent, increasing the tactical depth of the game. The game is currently in the early access stage and available for wishlisting on the Epic Games Store, which is one of the leading digital distribution platforms in the gaming industry.
