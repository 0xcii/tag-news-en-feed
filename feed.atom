Shiba Inu Social Volume Has Risen 65% In The Past Week
 
Shiba Inu has enjoyed an uptrend recently as the much-anticipated Shibarium upgrade of the memecoin is expected to drop later this month. This rally started around the start of this month, and within only a couple of days, the asset’s value registered a rapid growth to the $0.00001050 mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday asked for additional public feedback on a proposal to list a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), likely delaying any decision on the high-profile applications.
 
SEC Seeks Public Opinion on Spot Bitcoin ETF
 
The SEC put out a 34-page request for comment on the Ark Invest and 21Shares application, seeking views on whether the proposal meets regulatory standards. The move pushes any decision on the bitcoin ETF beyond the initially reported August deadline.
 
The agency asked for public input on concerns around potential manipulation of the proposed ETF and the underlying bitcoin market. It raised questions about whether the CME bitcoin futures market is a “regulated market of significant size” for the spot ETF.
 
The SEC also seeks feedback on the liquidity and efficiency of bitcoin markets and plans for the ETF sponsors to share surveillance data with the agency. “Written data, views, and arguments” are due in 21 days, the request details.
 
 
This marks the latest roadblock for approval of a spot bitcoin ETF after years of applications. The SEC has greenlighted bitcoin futures ETFs but resisted spot funds over worries about manipulation and insufficient regulation of crypto markets.
 
Friday’s request likely extends the long wait for a spot bitcoin ETF, which issuers say would provide a safer way for mainstream investors to gain exposure. The SEC will weigh the new feedback before making any final decision on the Ark and 21Shares application. The senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas, said the SEC move was “pretty standard.”

The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a headline indicator meticulously tracked by economists, exhibited a modest 0.2% uptick in July, contributing to a cumulative inflation rate of 3.2%, a figure slightly below the anticipated 3.3%.

        <updated>2023-08-11T16:52:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friday morning, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) solicited comments on 21 Shares and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest's spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, further delaying the process.



This is the second delay in the listing process for this ETF, with the first delay happening earlier this year. The third deadline for the SEC's decision is scheduled for later this year for November 11. If the SEC delays the application again, it will go to its fourth and final deadline on January 10, 2024. 
The race for approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States gained huge momentum earlier this year when the worlds largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed for one of their own. After that, big institutions including Fidelity, VanEck and WisdomTree among others, piled in and filed for their own spot Bitcoin ETFs.  
The first mover advantage of being the first to have its Bitcoin ETF approved and listed may prove to be vital in its performance. Galaxy Digital CEO and billionaire Mike Novogratz said in an earnings call earlier this week, "The news of both BlackRock filing ETF and quite frankly, Invesco plus Galaxy, we're going to fight like cats and dogs to win market share there once it gets approved. It's a big, big deal."
Earlier this year on July 27, the SEC approved a leveraged, 2x Bitcoin futures ETF, which leaves many scratching their heads as to how that is safe for investors, but not a spot ETF. Grayscale, who is currently in a legal battle with the SEC over the denial of its spot Bitcoin ETF application, sent a letter to the U.S. Court of Appeals protesting exactly this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robinhood seems to be finally done with a legal battle that has spanned the course of more than two years. Robinhood Markets recently defeated a group of investors as a United States Federal Appeals court just dismissed the appeal of a class action lawsuit against the crypto and stock trading firm.
 
Appeals Court Throws Out Case Against Robinhood
 
The lawsuit’s background dates back to January 2021, when Robinhood placed restrictions on trades of certain volatile “meme” stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. The limits, including temporarily preventing buys of some stocks, outraged users who couldn’t take advantage of price swings.
