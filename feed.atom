The regulatory body contends that these ventures engaged in unregistered offerings of “crypto asset securities,” accumulating a huge amount of $1 billion from investors.
 
 
The Commission further accuses Heart of defrauding investors by using approximately $12 million of the raised funds to purchase extravagant goods, including luxury cars, watches, and a 555-carat black diamond.

        <updated>2023-08-01T18:02:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ordinals team, led by creator Casey Rodarmor, has introduced the "Open Ordinals Institute," a non-profit organization aimed at advancing the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol and its reference implementation, Ord.
The Open Ordinals Institute will financially support Ordinals core developers, including the newly appointed lead maintainer, Raph, fostering an open-source contributor environment for sustained growth and high-quality contributions.
In a statement sent to Bitcoin Magazine, Raph emphasized the importance of collaboration and community engagement in the Ordinals protocol development.
"We want to create an open-source contributor environment where long-term and high-quality commitments are possible. Close collaboration and wider community engagement with Ordinals is encouraged and supported," he said.
Operating as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Open Ordinals Institute will accept tax-deductible donations, enabling a transparent and sustainable funding model. Previously funded privately and through personal gifts, this shift ensures the protocol's neutrality while supporting developers.
Ordinals core developer Ordinally echoed this sentiment in a statement, saying that the non-profit organization presents itself as "the cleanest way" to compensate developers without compromising the neutrality of the protocol.
The Ordinals.org website will facilitate community updates and resource sharing related to the Ordinals protocol development.
Donations to support the Ordinals core team and the Open Ordinals Institute can be made at Ordinals.org. The organization expects IRS approval for tax-deductible status in 2023, currently accepting Bitcoin donations.
The Open Ordinals Institute's establishment assures a promising future for the transformative Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, facilitating its continuous growth and development.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As bitcoin dipped below the $29K threshold and the overall crypto economy experienced a 1.4% decrease to $1.17 trillion, cryptocurrency derivatives markets underwent $92 million in liquidations, primarily in long positions.
 
Cascading Effect: Bitcoin’s Fall Under $29K Sparks $92 Million in Liquidations
 
The crypto economy, along with a significant number of digital assets, faced a decline on the first day of August. The total value of the crypto market fell by 1.4% within the previous 24 hours, landing at $1.17 trillion as of Tuesday morning (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).
 
 
The day’s largest losers included PLS and HEX, two tokens tied to Richard Heart’s projects. In addition, COMP, AAVE, SNX, GMX, and APE sustained losses ranging from 4.87% to 11.35% over the last day.
 
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 1.61% against the US dollar, while ethereum (ETH) fell by 1.72%. With its network’s impending halving event in less than 24 hours, litecoin (LTC) managed to ward off losses and maintained a 0.73% increase as of 11 a.m. on Tuesday.
 
Nevertheless, like bitcoin and various other cryptocurrencies, LTC prices slipped throughout the late hours on July 31. According to coinglass.com data, LTC derivatives traders encountered $2.63 million in liquidations, with $1.88 million in long positions.
 
 
Of all cryptocurrency derivatives markets, $92.95 million was liquidated over the past day; bitcoin (BTC) positions accounted for $22.38 million and ETH for $16.73 million in liquidations. XRP saw $4.66 million in liquidations, while CRV registered $5.87 million over the previous 24 hours.
 
Approximately $80.20 million of these liquidations originated from long positions and $12.76 million from shorts. In the last 12 hours alone, there were $13.88 million in liquidations, which included $7.79 million in long positions.
