        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raoul Pal, a well-known figure in the financial sector, provided a striking forecast for the future of cryptocurrencies.
 
His analysis suggests a potential rise in the market’s total capitalization to $100 trillion, spurred by global liquidity trends and technological adoption.
 
The Mechanics Behind The Prediction
 
Pal’s insights are rooted in his observation of the global liquidity cycle, which has been shaping macroeconomic trends since 2008. He notes that this cycle has played a crucial role in driving asset growth, particularly in the technology and crypto sectors.
 
 
In addition, Pal noted that the depreciation of fiat currencies, necessitated by the need to service growing global debt, is pushing asset prices higher.

Pepe (PEPE) And Dogwifhat (WIF) Could Lead The Way For Meme Coins
 
PEPE and WIF look set to lead the way if there is another meme coin mania due to Gill’s return. Gill was at the helm of the GameStop saga in 2021 when a group of Reddit traders staged a financial revolution against hedge fund managers who had been shorting the retail company’s stock. This led to GameStop’s stock rising from under $3 to $483 in under a month.
