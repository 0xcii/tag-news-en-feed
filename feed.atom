        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has  
today (Friday) released new guidance regarding the issuance of stablecoins. This  
document addresses default guarantees, associated risks, and FINMA's approach  
to regulating stablecoins. It also highlights increased risks related to money  
laundering.
Stablecoin Risks Highlighted
In recent years, stablecoin projects have gained  
significance in Switzerland. These projects aim to offer a low-volatility  
payment method on blockchain technology. FINMA had previously addressed  
stablecoin concerns in its supplement to the ICO guidelines issued in September  
2019.

Bitcoin HODLers Have Gone Back To Net Accumulation
 
As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the long-term holders have been increasing their supply recently. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors who have held onto their coins for more than 155 days.
 
These holders make up one of the two main divisions of the BTC market based on holding time, with the other cohort being known as the “short-term holders” (STHs).
 
 
Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell, so the LTHs, who tend to hold for long periods, represent the stubborn side of t…]]></summary>

At spot rates, Bitcoin is down 6% from last week’s highs and roughly 12% from all-time highs. Contracting prices also mean lower lows from all-time highs, a bearish signal.
 
Bitcoin Whales Ramping Up Purchase
 
Despite this confluence of bearish signals, there are hints that buyers are accumulating at spot rates. As prices breach $66,000, the primary support, on-chain data shared by Ki Young Ju on X, points to strength, at least looking at whale behavior.

However, it will calculate the value of the claims based on the date of the bankruptcy and not the current crypto market value.
Recovery of Funds from FTX
The return of the claim in its entirety became possible as the bankruptcy administrator of the bankrupt BlockFi “successfully sold… outstanding claims against FTX for an amount in excess of the face value of the claims.”
“While these recoveries cannot undo the impact of the platform pause, efficiently distributing 100% of the dollarised value of allowed claims to eligible clients in the near future is an extraordinarily positive outcome,” the announcement noted.
