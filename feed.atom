        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Israel-Hamas conflict, an enduring and deeply entrenched geopolitical issue, has captured global attention for years. However, one area that seems remarkably impervious to the ebbs and flows of this contentious conflict is the cryptocurrency sector. While the conflict affects the lives of many, cryptocurrency remains largely detached from its influence.
 
The conflict escalated significantly as Gaza militants launched a surprise attack early Saturday, leading to at least 300 deaths and thousands of injuries in Israel, with ongoing fighting and rocket attacks in Tel Aviv and other areas, reports said.
 
In Gaza, the Palestinian health ministry reported at least 232 Palestinian casualties and over 1,600 injuries due to Israeli air strikes and ground clashes with Hamas fighters. Additiona…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash was one of the big gainers to start the weekend, as the cryptocurrency ended a two-day losing streak. Overall, the momentum in the market was marginally higher, as traders continued to consume the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. TRON also returned to the green on Saturday.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was a notable mover on Saturday, as the cryptocurrency returned to the green after a recent losing streak.
 
After falling to a low of $227.13 on Friday, BCH/USD rose by as much as 2%, hitting a high of $234.82 to start the weekend.
 
The rise in price comes as bulls continued to push the token away from a recent support point, which was at the $225.00 mark.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that bulls opted to buy the recent dip, after the relative strength index (RSI) collided with a support point at 56.00
 
At the time of writing, price strength now resides at 58.60, with a ceiling at 60.00 the next point of resistance.
 
Bulls will need to surpass this point in order to push bitcoin cash over the $240.00 level, which appears to be the next target for traders.
 
 
Tron (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) ended a three-day winless run to start the weekend, moving away from a one-week low in the process.
 
TRX/USD jumped to a peak of $0.08818 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $0.08558.
 
Similar to BCH, today’s rally came after a brief breakout of a key support level, in this instance at $0.08550.
 
 
Price strength also edged higher on Saturday, climbing back above a floor at the 58.00 zone, and is now tracking at 58.45.
 
The next visible area of resistance now looks to be at 61.00, with a more long-term target of 68.00 also in sight.
 
Should these points be captured in the upcoming days, TRON could be trading above $0.09000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin traded above $28,000 to start the weekend, after Joe Rogan commented that it had a chance of becoming a “universal viable currency.” Additionally, traders also reacted to yesterday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls, which rose by 336,000 in September, more than the 170,000 many had expected. Ethereum was marginally higher on Saturday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade around the $28,000 level on Saturday, as traders responded to podcast phenom Joe Rogan, discussing the cryptocurrency.
 
Speaking to founder of Openai Sam Altman, Rogan said, “That’s the one that has the most likely possibility of becoming a universal viable currency.”
 
BTC/USD peaked at $28,252.54 following the comments, following a low at $27,215.55 during Friday’s session.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came after the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of its own price ceiling at 61.00.
 
Currently, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 62.25, with the next visible ceiling at the 65.00 mark.
 
Should the index reach this point, there is a strong possibility that bitcoin will be trading above $28,500.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Despite not being lauded by Rogan, ethereum (ETH) also made marginal gains to start the weekend.
 
Following a low of $1,613.38 on Friday, ETH/USD moved to an intraday high of $1,659.61 as the session progressed.
 
As of writing, gains have somewhat faded, with the world’s second largest cryptocurrency now trading at $1,641.61.
 
 
The 14-day RSI on ethereum is now hovering near a resistance of 50.00, however unlike BTC, it has not yet been able to break out of this zone.
 
In the event this takes place in the coming hours, ethereum bulls will likely make another run for the $1,700 level.
