        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Argentine primary elections have unveiled a seismic shift in the nation’s political landscape: Pro-Bitcoin candidate Javier Milei, representing the La Libertad Avanza group, has not only emerged as the unexpected victor but has also delivered a clarion call for a radical transformation in Argentina’s political and economic direction.
 
With 90% of the votes counted, Milei’s commanding lead at 30.5% has left traditional political behemoths, the main conservative opposition bloc and the ruling Peronist coalition, trailing at 28% and 27% respectively. This result is a clear indication of the Argentine populace’s growing disillusionment with the established political order, especially in the face of a crippling economic crisis marked by a staggering 116% inflation rate.

Researchers Juan Ignacio Ibañez and Alexander Freier make the case that Bitcoin miners’ demand for cheap electricity provides incentives for increased renewable energy production.
