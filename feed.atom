The bullish preview hinges on Bitcoin’s historical performance after breaking all-time highs (ATHs), especially in the last years, including 2017 and 2022. Since October 2023, the coin has been trending higher, rising from below $25,000 to surging above the $40,000 level. 
 
In the first two weeks of March, the coin broke above $70,000 to register fresh all-time highs of around $72,800. However, bulls are not slowing down. Looking at recent price action, Bitcoin broke above $73,000 on March 12 before those gains were extended on March 13.

The notes, unsecured and senior obligations of MicroStrategy, will bear semi-annual interest payable on March 15 and September 15, commencing September 15, 2024. Set to mature on March 15, 2031, the notes may be redeemed by MicroStrategy on or after March 22, 2028, subject to certain conditions.
