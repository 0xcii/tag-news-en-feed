        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The legal battle between Ripple and the SEC over  
allegations of illegal sale of cryptocurrencies has reached a crucial step as the long-awaited  
trial starts today (Tuesday). The SEC first accused Ripple Labs of offering  
unregistered securities in December 2020. 
Ripple's defense is based on the argument that its  
native cryptocurrency, XRP, should not be classified as a security. As the  
trial begins, the crypto sector is eagerly awaiting the outcome, which  
could have significant implications for the future of Ripple and the broader digital asset industry, CryptoPotato reported. 
A Prolonged Legal Dispute
This trial represents an important moment for

A recent court ruling against the SEC in a case against crypto platform DEBT Box has exposed accusations of misconduct and cast doubt on the agency’s regulatory tactics.
 
 
The controversy centers around a lawsuit filed by the SEC in August 2023, alleging a $50 million crypto fraud scheme perpetrated by DEBT Box. To halt the Utah-based company’s operations, the SEC secured a temporary freeze on its assets and restraining orders against its executives.
 
However, the case unraveled spectacularly in March 2024 when Judge Robert J. Shelby of the Utah District Court sanctioned the SEC for “egregious misrepresentations” during the initial hearing.…]]></summary>

Janet Yellen’s ‘Buy Bitcoin’ Sign Sparks Auction Frenzy
 
The message, a rallying cry for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, gained notoriety after being displayed behind former Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Janet Yellen during her congressional testimony about seven years ago. Bidding on the ink drawing is expected to close late Wednesday.

Halving is a periodic event for Bitcoin in which its block rewards—that is, the rewards that miners receive for solving blocks on the network—are permanently cut in half.
 
This event takes place roughly every four years, and the latest one was completed just recently. This was the fourth Halving the cryptocurrency has gone through, and its block rewards have now come down to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.
