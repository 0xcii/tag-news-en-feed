In a detailed statement on X (formerly Twitter), Nerayoff claims that he had turned down an allocation of over 1 million Ether (ETH). This decision, according to Nerayoff, stemmed from his commitment to avoid conflicts of interest and his vision for Ethereum, which he claims diverges from the current trajectory set by its founders.

At a point on Friday, the cryptocurrency shed about 10 percent, dropping below $42,000 from the $49,000 peak on the day before. However, it has corrected and is trading at around $42,700 as of press time.
Disappointing Demand for Bitcoin ETFs
Why did the market go in the other direction despite the massive anticipation for Bitcoin ETFs? Even experts previously anticipated that the ETFs would ease the entry barrier for retail and institutional investors to get crypto exposures directly from their brokerage accounts.
