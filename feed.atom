        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The  
cryptocurrency community has been buzzing over the idea of a Bitcoin  
exchange-traded fund (ETF) from BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset  
management businesses. An ETF would provide investors with a more convenient

to institutional and retail involvement.
BlackRock is a  
financial powerhouse:
According to  
the most recent available data, BlackRock is a giant in the asset management  
sector, managing approximately $9 trillion in assets. It has an impact on  
traditional asset classes such as equities, fixed income, and alternative

The most notable ones seem to have come from the testimonies of his ‘inner circle.’
 
How Sam Bankman-Fried Saw Himself
 
As part of its case, the prosecution got Alameda Reserach’s ex-CEO Caroline Ellison, FTX’s co-founder Gary Wang, and FTX’s former Director of Engineering Nishad Singh to testify against their former associate Bankman-Fried.

However, blockchain forensics firm Elliptic is challenging the notion that crypto has played a significant role in terrorist financing, emphasizing the misrepresentation of recent figures.
 
Elliptic, a firm specializing in blockchain forensics, has pointed out that the scale of crypto fundraising by Hamas may not be as substantial as recent reports suggest.
