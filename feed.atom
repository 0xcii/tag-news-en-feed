The appeal letter has sparked a heated debate among legal experts, with some suggesting that the appeal could indirectly challenge XRP’s status as a non-security.

This comes after Judge Torres of the US Southern District Court ruled last month that while Ripple’s direct sales of XRP to institutional investors v…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin retreated from a recent high on Thursday, in light of a much anticipated inflation report from the United States. The consumer price index rose to an annual rate of 3.2% last month, with core inflation falling to 4.7%. Ethereum also slipped into the red.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) gave up recent gains on Thursday, as markets reacted to the latest U.S. inflation report.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $29,376.80 earlier in today’s session, following a peak at $30,093.44 the day prior.
 
The decline sees bitcoin retreat from its highest level since July 20, when the price peaked at a level of $30,421.
 
 
One of the reasons for the drop appears to be the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) falling below a recent ceiling of 51.00
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at a reading of 50.51, with a floor of 41.00 the next visible target.
 
In the event that price strength reaches this level, there is a good chance that BTC will fall below the $29,000 mark.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) was also in the red during today’s session, as price fell lower for a second consecutive day.
 
Following a high of $1,869.74 on Wednesday, ETH/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,845.49 earlier in the day.
 
Price slightly rebounded following the latest U.S. consumer price index, which marginally rose in July.
 
 
The recent volatility in ethereum comes as the RSI was unable to break out of a ceiling at the 51.00 mark.
 
As of writing, ethereum’s price strength is sitting at 49.12, with price at $1,856.44.

Regardless of one’s own perspective on whether bitcoin is a financial asset or an already-established form of money, one thing is clear: it is up to the market to decide the role of bitcoin. The collective power of invested capital and market liquidity will always be the overriding factor.
A Warm Embrace For Bitcoin, With Limits
Bull market or bear market, Bitcoin is rarely out of the news. But it’s safe to say that 2023 has been a particularly-bubbly year in the BTC news cycle. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager with $9 trillion in assets under management (AUM), has applied for a spot bitcoin ETF, with CEO Larry Fink dubbing BTC …]]></summary>

All donations are converted into fiat currency within 24 hours after the donation has been made. Benjamin William said his organization has enabled the crypto option for “donors who are tech-savvy and wish to make a difference through their digital assets.”
 
Crypto Tax Deductions
 
The Singapore Red Cross has said well-wishers can now donate via cryptocurrency but donors will not receive tax deductions, a report has said. According to the charitable organization, all donations are converted into fiat currency less than 24 hours after the donation has been received.
 
As per a Straitstimes report, the Singapore Red Cross has partnered with the crypto payment gateway Triple A. Commenting on Singapore Red Cross’ decision to start accepting crypto donations, Benjamin William, the organization’s CEO, said:
 

By accepting digital currencies, we open our doors to a new segment of donors who are tech-savvy and wish to make a difference through their digital assets.
 
By accepting donations in the form of BTC, ETH, and the stablecoins USDT and USDC, the Singapore Red Cross joins other local charitable organizations such as The Food Bank Singapore, which already accepts cryptocurrencies.
 

 
According to the report, other crypto-accepting Singaporean charitable organizations such as Daughters of Tomorrow and Cycling Without Age are using the platform Digital Philanthropy.
