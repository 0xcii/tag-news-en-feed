        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a dramatic turn of events involving the Bitcoin price (BTC) during the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, shocking revelations have emerged from the testimony of his ex-girlfriend and former head of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison. 
 
The crucial highlight of her statements centers around an alleged conspiracy to manipulate Bitcoin prices by selling the cryptocurrency if it surpassed the $20,000 mark.
 
 
Bitcoin Price Scandal Unveiled
 
During the proceedings, Ellison disclosed damning conversations and documents that shed light on potential market manipulation. 
 
In one instance, she revealed a conversation note in which she wrote, “Keep selling BTC if it’s over $20K,” suggesting a deliberate effort to suppress Bitcoin prices. The prosecution pressed further, questioning …]]></summary>

Bitcoin Lightning Network Achieves New Height
 
According to the report from Bitcoin’s financial services River Financial, the Lightening Network’s 1,212% growth accounted for Routed transactions. Routed transactions basically involve more than two nodes, hence, the figure above could be significantly higher.  The network’s routed transactions have impressively increased from 503,115 in August 2021, to 6,599,553 by August 2023.

This is part of Chainway's continued efforts to implement ZK rollups on bitcoin, a move that may offer enhanced scalability and privacy features to bitcoin.
Chainway's recent demonstration serves as a proof of concept, illustrating how their future ZK rollup is intended to function when integrated with bitcoin. This integration seeks to combine the flexibility and programmability commonly associated with EVM and the robust security infrastructure inherent to bitcoin.
Diving deeper into the mechanics, rollups work by grouping transactions occurring off-chain, batching them, and then publishing this consolidated batch onto the bitcoin …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum’s shift from a deflationary to an inflationary model has witnessed a 0.178% uptick in the last 17 days. During this period, the network added 22,502 ether, valued at $35.31 million, to its total supply.
 
Ethereum’s Growing Inflation Fueled by Onchain Downturn
 
Previously, Ethereum maintained a deflationary stance, primarily due to the London hard fork’s EIP-1559 and the notable shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Yet, the past few months saw a marked decline in onchain activities.
 
Consequently, the EIP-1559’s fee-burning mechanism has been torching fewer ethers. Just 17 days back, Ethereum’s issuance rate was slightly inflationary, standing at 0.270% annually. But as of now, it hovers around 0.448%, marking a rise of 0.178%.

Bitcoin Miners Have Sold 20,000 BTC In Past Week
 
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, BTC miners have done some significant selling during the last week. The relevant indicator here is the “miner reserve,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin that the miners as a whole are carrying in their wallets.
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that these chain validators are making deposits into their addresses currently. Such a trend suggests that the miners are accumulating right now, which can naturally be bullish for the asset’s price.
 
 
On the other hand, drawdowns in the indicator imply the miners are…]]></summary>
