However, Bitcoin enjoyed a stroke of fortune in the past week, with its price climbing above $67,000 for the first time in nearly a month. Although the sentiment around the crypto market and its leader has not been particularly encouraging in the last few weeks, the recent bullish rally seems to be driving a shift in that regard.
