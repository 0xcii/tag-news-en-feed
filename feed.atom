The pilot project, which began in 2020, has generated significant revenue for ARLP by capitalizing on underutilized electricity at its River View mine.
 
 
Bitcoin Mining Success And Adaptability
 
ARLP’s strategic foray into crypto mining has proven fruitful, with the company generating 425 BTC worth $30 million. CFO Cary Marshall, during an earnings call, highlighted the company’s ability to adapt and generate revenue from existing resources. ARLP’s focus has been solely on mining with their existing equipment, rather than actively buying Bitcoin.

        <updated>2024-05-02T17:02:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency app MoonPay has partnered with PayPal to introduce crypto  
purchasing options to MoonPay users in the United States. The new offering  
allows users to use PayPal for transactions via wallet transfers, bank  
transfers, and debit cards. 
The integration promises to enhance the  
accessibility and convenience of buying and trading cryptocurrencies by  
bridging the gap between traditional financial services and the burgeoning  
crypto market.
Expanding Crypto Accessibility
According to the announcement on X, the  
collaboration between MoonPay and PayPal signifies a significant milestone in  
the journey towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Users have access to a wider range  
of digital assets, and PayPal has extended its offering of crypto tokens  
through MoonPay. 
Additionally, PayPal's integration into MoonPay's ecosystem represents a  
significant achievement in overcoming barriers to cryptocurrency adoption. Traditional banks have often imposed  
restrictions on transactions  
related to cryptocurrencies, leading to  
frustrations for users. This collaboration opens up new avenues for individuals  
seeking to invest in cryptocurrencies.

🌙 Exciting news from MoonPay! 💳Today, we're thrilled to announce a game-changing integration: MoonPay has partnered with @PayPal to offer seamless fiat-to-crypto transactions for users in the U.S.!🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/N3kobMR2ru
— MoonPay 🟣 (@moonpay) May 2, 2024
"MoonPay allows PayPal users to buy and  
sell 110+ cryptocurrencies, not just limited options like PYUSD or ETH. For  
existing PayPal users, the integration streamlines transactions, eliminating  
the need to manually input card information. Buying crypto on MoonPay becomes  
as easy as a few clicks," MoonPay noted.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

These special satoshis, which do not exist natively on Bitcoin, but can be identified by a companion piece of software, are considered some of the most scarce and significant in Bitcoin's history. While Bitcoin has a hard limit of 2.1 quadrillion satoshis, or 2.1 million BTC, the protocol does not track them individually.

Despite the surge, Norby points out a downside to this rapid expansion: the influx of “many low-quality wallets,” which he accepts as an inevitable aspect…]]></summary>
