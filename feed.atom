However, at this time, all of their profitability levels remain different, meaning investors in these meme coins are seeing varying levels of profit and losses. In this report, we compare the profitability levels of these three meme coins, in a bid to figure out which has been the best investment based on return on investment.
 
Dogecoin Profitability Remains Highest
 
As the largest meme coin in the market, the Dogecoin price has often set the tone for how investors are looking at meme coins. This often means a rally for Dogecoin can often spread to the other meme coins and trigger a market-wide meme coin rally. As a result, it remains the top choice for meme coin investors.
