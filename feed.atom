        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sentencing of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, also known as “CZ,” on a money laundering rule charge has been delayed until April 30, a notice in Seattle federal court disclosed.
 
This two-month postponement comes after Zhao, a Canadian national and former Binance CEO, pleaded guilty on Nov. 21 to a charge of failure to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.
 
 
Harsher Sentence For Former Binance Boss?
 
The delay in sentencing, which was originally scheduled for Feb. 23, has raised questions about the potential factors contributing to this decision.
 
Federal sentencing guidelines suggest a maximum sentence of 18 months in prison for Zhao, but prosecutors have reportedly considered seeking a harsher sentence.

Traditionally, institutional and enterprise investors, whether acquiring bitcoin itself or its derivatives, have turned to large, publicly-traded custodians to manage their bitcoin.

Yet at the same time, Bitcoin’s already decreasing supply is set to plunge further with its quadrennial halving just months away. This burgeoning imbalance threatens to ignite Bitcoin’s next bull run.

In their first month of operation, several high-profile spot Bitcoin ETFs have aggressively accumulated BTC holdings. BlackRock’s spot ETF has amassed over 78,000 BTC worth nearly $3 billion. At its current pace, Fidelity’s ETF holds 66,000 BTC and counting.
 
Across the slate of approved funds, over 192,000 BTC has already been swallowed up. This represents 0.89% of Bitcoin’s total circulati…]]></summary>

However, these milestones are not related to its price, which has yet to surpass the previous peak of $69,000.
 
Batten’s insights were detailed in the latest issue of “The Bitcoin ESG Forecast,” where he elucidates on how BTC is gradually gaining traction among institutional investors, particularly within the $23 trillion ESG funds sector.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wall Street is on a Bitcoin buying spree, acquiring the digital asset at a staggering rate 12.5 times greater than its daily production, according to industry expert Anthony Pompliano. This relentless accumulation hints at big money’s growing conviction in the cypto’s future, fueled by the approaching “halving” event and the recent green light for ETFs.
 
 
Imagine printing money, then cutting production in half. That’s essentially what happens with Bitcoin’s halving, scheduled for April 2024. Every four years, the reward for mining new Bitcoins gets slashed, gradually reducing the total supply to a predetermined 21 million. This built-in scarcity is a major draw for institutions, who anticipate a price surge as demand outpaces supply.
