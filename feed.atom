With just two days remaining until the expected news from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), crypto investment services provider Matrixport and 10x Research expect the regulator to reject all applications for listing a spot Bitcoin ETF this month.
 
Bitcoin Price Dips 6% On Matrixport’s ETF Rejection Prediction
 
In a note released on Wednesday, Matrixport stated that all applications fall short of a critical requirement for SEC approval. While this requirement may be met by the second quarter of 2024, Matrixport anticipates that the SEC will reject all proposals in January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, has once again sparked the curiosity of the SHIB community with a cryptic post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform. There are some indications that his post could be alluding to a potential partnership on the horizon. 
 
What Kusama’s Cryptic Post Could Mean
 
Kusama’s post, which only contained a ‘handshake’ emoji, could suggest that Shiba Inu (SHIB) or the Shibarium network is working on or has sealed a significant partnership. The partnership speculation is fuelled by the fact that Kusama had reposted an X post by Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lucie before he also made his cryptic post. 
 
 
In Lucie’s post, she alluded to the connection between SHIB and Shibarium. Notably, there was a ‘chain’ emoji close to the word “SHIB,” which could be an allusi…]]></summary>

One of the oddest and most mysterious relationships that emerged out of the collapse of FTX last year was Alameda Research’s unusual relationship with Farmington State Bank, one of the smallest, rural banks in the United States that came under the control of Jean Chalopin in 2020. Chalopin is best known as the chairman of Deltec, one of the main banks for Alameda Research – FTX’s trading arm that played a central role in its collapse — and still one of the main banks for the largest fiat-backed stablecoin, Tether (USDT). Chalopin had acquired control over Farmington via FBH Corp., where Chalopin was listed as executive officer.

Bitcoin
 
The past day saw bitcoin’s price range fluctuate between $41,804 and $45,813 with a market capitalization of $832 billion and trading volume of around $35.96 billion. The oscillators and moving averages hint at a diverging sentiment: while the momentum and moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) level indicate bearish action, there’s a strong bullish signal from the exponential and simple moving averages, especially over longer periods (50, 100, and 200 days).
