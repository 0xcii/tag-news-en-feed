        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining company Iris Energy Limited said on Dec. 15 that it expects to take delivery of 8,380 new-generation T21 miners from Bitmain. Delivery of the mining machines is expected to help Iris Energy fulfill its goal of increasing its self-mining capacity to 10 EH/s (exahash per second).
 
Acquisition to Improve Overall Fleet Efficiency
 
The Australian Bitcoin mining company Iris Energy Limited announced on Dec. 15 that it is set to acquire $22.3 million worth of 8,380 new-generation T21 miners from Bitmain Technologies Delaware Limited. Once installed, the T21s, together with S21s, are expected to improve the Bitcoin miner’s “overall fleet efficiency from 29.5 J/TH to 24.8 J/TH.”
 
In a statement, Iris Energy said the shipment of the T21s is scheduled for the second quarter of 2024. Delivery of the mining machines is expected to help Iris Energy fulfill its goal of increasing self-mining capacity.
 
“The company’s 80MW data center expansion at Childress remains on track to be progressively delivered from January 2024 through to Q2 2024, supporting the increase in operating hash rate from 5.6 EH/s to 10 EH/s,” the Bitcoin miner said.
 
 

Iris Energy added that its 80MW data center expansion at Childress is on course to be “progressively” delivered starting in January 2024 through to Q2 2024. This is expected to support the increase in the operating hash rate.
 
According to the statement, the purchase price for the Bitcoin miners, which translates to $14/TH (terahash), is payable in progressive installments.
