Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Just Observed A Deep Plunge
 
As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained, the Coinbase Premium Gap has seen a rapid trend reversal recently. The “Coinbase Premium Gap” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).
 
When the value of this metric is greater than zero, it means the price of the asset listed on Coinbase is greater than that on Binance. Such a trend implies that users on the former are participating in a higher amount of buying or a lower amount of selling than users on the latter.

PayPal first introduced the PYUSD stablecoin in August 2023 on the Ethereum network.
