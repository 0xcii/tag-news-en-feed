The ‘Miracle’ Rebound Of Shiba Inu
 
Lucie made a post on X about her belief that SHIB can pull off a “miracle recovery” and reach a new all-time high (ATH) soon. This optimistic outlook comes amidst a period of decline for SHIB.
 
Since March 14th, the token has shed over 20%, currently trading at roughly 70% below its October 2021 peak. However, Lucie clarifies that her statement is a personal opinion, not an official prediction from the Shiba Inu team.
