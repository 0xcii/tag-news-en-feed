She noted that the central bank has two risks to manage. “One is that inflation doesn’t come down back to their target as they envisioned, and the other is that the economy becomes too weak,” she detailed.
 
Yellen Discusses U.S. Economy
 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen discussed the state of the U.S. economy in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged for the third consecutive time.
 
While stating that “Inflation has come down meaningfully,” Yellen cautioned: “There’s further to go for the Fed to achieve its 2 percent objective, but I think we’re on a path, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BRC-20 tokens, a new type of token standard built on the Bitcoin network, have been slowly inching into popularity among crypto enthusiasts. This popularity grew when Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, listed the ORDI token which went from $10 to $60, and then most recently, the exchange listed another BRC-20 token known as SATS. As the flames of bullishness are fanned by these listings, here are some BRC-20 tokens that could offer a good return on investment going forward.
 
OXBT (OXBT) BRC-20 Tokens
 
One of the most recognizable BRC-20 tokens that still has a relatively low market cap is the OXBT token. This token has followed the BRC-20 trend to a T, with a community behind it. As such, it is well-positioned to take advantage of any hype in the community.

        <updated>2023-12-14T20:57:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), hinted at a potential shift in the SEC's perspective regarding spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications during an interview with CNBC.



In the CNBC interview, Gensler disclosed that the SEC is actively reconsidering its approach to spot Bitcoin ETF applications. "And as you might know, we had in the past denied a number of these applications, but the courts here in the District of Columbia weighed in on that," said Gensler. "And so we’re taking a new look at this based upon those court rulings."
A spot Bitcoin ETF differs from its futures-based counterpart as it allows investors direct exposure to Bitcoin without relying on futures contracts. This distinction could potentially facilitate easier access to BTC for traditional investors seeking exposure.
The SEC has historically maintained a negative approach towards approving spot Bitcoin ETFs due to concerns surrounding market manipulation, investor protection, and regulatory compliance. Gensler's acknowledgment of the SEC's reassessment suggests a willingness to explore and potentially embrace approving a spot Bitcoin ETF, marking a possible shift in the regulatory landscape.
However, specific details regarding the potential timeline or criteria for approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs remain undisclosed as the SEC continues its thorough review process. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted at the beginning of December that the next window of potential ETF approvals is January 5-10, 2024. 
"Really this means that any potential approval orders are going to come on either Monday Jan 8, Tuesday Jan 9, or Wednesday Jan 10," Seyffart explained further. "Mark your calendars people."
As the SEC reevaluates its stance, the Bitcoin industry eagerly awaits further developments regarding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which could significantly impact broader adoption and acceptance of BTC among institutional and retail investors.]]></summary>
