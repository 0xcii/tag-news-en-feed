Data indicates that Solana-based dex platforms achieved a volume of $1.447 billion in the past day, overshadowing the $1.282 billion recorded by Ethereum trading platforms. 
 
Solana Surges Past Ethereum in Dex Volume
 
Solana’s recent price surge, coupled with a multitude of airdrops, has propelled the layer one (L1) blockchain’s dex volumes to new heights. Conversely, trade volume for solana (SOL) on centralized exchanges lags behind that of Ethereum. Data from Deflllama.com confirms that both the 24-hour and weekly dex volumes for Solana have exceeded those of Ethereum.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), for example, faces a severe electricity deficit, with over 600 million people without power. This deficit leads to economic stagnation, reduced food production, poverty, and even civil unrest. The correlation between electricity access and economic growth is undeniable, and regions with less than 80% electrification rates consistently suffer from reduced GDP per capita. The challenge lies in expanding electrical infrastructure to these underserved areas, which is capital-intensive and often financially unfeasible for governments with limited resources.

However, despite their forward-thinking proposal, the SEC officially rejected the proposal in March 2017, citing concerns about market surveillance and regulation. At the time, the Bitcoin price dropped some 30 percent on the news, declining from a high of around $1…]]></summary>

researchers revealed that cryptocurrency users lost nearly $2 billion to scams,  
rug pulls, and hacks in 2023. Although this represented a significant reduction  
from the previous year, it underscores the ongoing vulnerability of the  
industry to security risks.
Market Decline and Improved Awareness Contribute to Lowered  
Crypto Risks
The decrease in losses is largely attributed to the  
implementation of enhanced security protocols, increased awareness within the  
community, and an overall decline in market activity. Notably, this reduction  
becomes even more substantial when factoring in the $40 billion lost to the  
collapses of the stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs, the crypto lender Celsius, and the
