        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chase UK’s recent decision to ban cryptocurrency transactions for its customers has sparked debate within the crypto community. While the bank cites concerns over scams and fraud as the rationale behind this move, critics argue that it contradicts the United Kingdom’s crypto policy objectives. 
 
Jesper Johansen, founder and CEO of crypto service provider Northstake, expressed his reservations about the decision in an interview with Blockworks, stating:
 
 
“Firstly, this ban contradicts the UK government’s stated policy goal to develop favorable conditions and a supportive environment for crypto businesses to set up and scale their services.”  
 
This divergence from national policy goals raises questions about the bank’s commitment to the country’s evolving crypto landscape.

While developers of L1 blockchains focus on improving the base protocol, L2 programmers have moved transactions off-chain to enable faster and cheaper transactions. 
 
What Are Layer One Blockchains?
 
Layer one or L1 refers to a base blockchain protocol like Bitcoin or Ethereum. These networks operate on a decentralized ledger secured by proof-of-work (PoW) mining or proof-of-stake (PoS) staking. L1 chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum offer unparalleled security. However, during peak times, both of these chains grapple with sluggish transaction speeds and steep fees.
