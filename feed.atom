        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-rallies-to-1-month-high-as-eth-nears-1300/"/>
        <updated>2022-12-13T14:47:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin surged to a one-month high on Dec. 13, ahead of the latest inflation report from the United States. It is expected that consumer prices will fall to 7.3% in November, which would be a drop of 0.4% from the month prior. Ethereum was also higher in today’s session, as prices neared the $1,300 mark.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a one-month high on Tuesday, as markets began to price in a fall in consumer prices in the United States.
 
Following a low of $16,966.59 to start the week, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $17,457.30 earlier in today’s session.
 
This move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency fly to its strongest point since November 11, when price was at a high of $17,645.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, today’s surge comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved beyond a ceiling of its own.
 
The index climbed above a resistance level of 52.00 earlier in the day, and as of writing is tracking at 55.00.
 
Despite this afternoon’s report, we will likely see more volatility on Wednesday, as traders get ready for the upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve rate decision.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also rose in today’s session, as bulls reentered the market, taking prices close to the $1,300 level.
 
ETH/USD raced to a high of $1,294.10 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after hovering at a low of $1,248.36.
 
As a result of today’s move, ETH/USD moved closer to a recent resistance level of $1,300, as prices were almost 4% higher than Monday’s peak.
 
 
Like with bitcoin, bullish sentiment in ethereum returned following a breakout of a resistance level at the 53.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 53.75, and now seems to be moving towards a ceiling of 55.00.
 
ETH will likely recapture the $1,300 level, however what happens at that level is the key question for traders.

Is bitcoin volatile? How does one determine volatility? How can those with diamond hands so decisively say “no,” while those stuck in the fiat mindset so emphatically say “yes”? Which one is correct? Is it just that both sides have to agree to disagree, or can both of these seeming contradictions simultaneously be true? 
To truly answer these questions, we should first analyze Albert Einstein’s special theory of relativity…

Ready for a hot take? Check this: Money has no inherent value. And, besides being a special kind of money that allows for disintermediated transfers, the same applies to bitcoin. 
As banal as it may sound, money is just a means to an end. As a matter of fact, it’s a means to any number of ends. And those ends are what matter. Money — whether dollars, satoshis or the rai stones of Yap — is not valuable for what it is, but for what it lets us do. We transform money into experiences, and experiences are what make a life, not ledger entries. Everything else is bank propaga…]]></summary>

Crypto Twitter is currently philosophizing that it is strange timing that SBF is arrested by Bahamian authorities the day before his hearing in front of the US Congress.
 
Bankman-Fried is reportedly in custody awaiting extradition to the United States. As a result, Bankman-Fried will not be able to give his testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.
 
Instead, new FTX CEO John Ray will replace his predecessor. Remarkably, however, SBF already had a speech prepared to give today. Forbes managed to get a hold of that document.
