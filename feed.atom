a court filing on Wednesday (yesterday), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)  
firmly opposed the renewed motion for temporary release filed by Sam  
Bankman-Fried, the Founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, ahead of his  
upcoming trial. 
The  
motion sought his temporary release with stringent restrictions.  However, it has been met with strong  
resistance from prosecutors. They contend that the arguments put forth by  
Bankman-Fried's legal team lack specificity and fail to establish a compelling  
case for his release.

While developers of L1 blockchains focus on improving the base protocol, L2 programmers have moved transactions off-chain to enable faster and cheaper transactions. 
 
What Are Layer One Blockchains?
 
Layer one or L1 refers to a base blockchain protocol like Bitcoin or Ethereum. These networks operate on a decentralized ledger secured by proof-of-work (PoW) mining or proof-of-stake (PoS) staking. L1 chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum offer unparalleled security. However, during peak times, both of these chains grapple with sluggish transaction speeds and steep fees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has announced its full exit from Russia with a sale to a newly launched exchange. This move comes as a response to the firm’s compliance issues related to Western sanctions imposed on Russia.
 
In August, Binance began considering an exit from the Russian markets following reports of its continued support for sanctioned Russian banks on its platform. While the crypto exchange has since severed ties with these financial institutions, it seems set on also permanently discontinuing its operations in Russia.
