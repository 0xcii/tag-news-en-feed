        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao is facing the challenging task of dispelling rumors about his wealth, as the crypto sphere is renowned for producing a multitude of billionaires. As per a report by Bloomberg, it appears that ‘CZ’ is no different.
 
Although Binance does not publicly disclose any financial reports regarding the billionaire’s stake and the company’s revenues, Bloomberg conducted its own analysis and concluded that CZ’s net worth is approximately $28.2 billion, placing him in the 3rd spot on their list of the top 25 wealthiest individuals.
 
And while most individuals on the list would be proud, CZ appears to have been taken aback by the figures, and slammed Bloomberg for its alleged false narrative.

According to Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, Bitcoin could benefit from recent turmoil in the banking sector, a stabilization of risk assets as the US Federal Reserve ends its interest rate-hiking cycle, and improved profitability of crypto mining.
 
While the cryptocurrency’s original goal of serving as a hedge against skyrocketing inflation last year was unsuccessful, it recently achieved success by serving as a wager against the traditional banking system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
