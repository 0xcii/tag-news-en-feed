        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FTX co-founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, is facing yet another criminal charge, this time for allegedly bribing Chinese government officials with $40 million worth of cryptocurrency. 
 
According to federal prosecutors, this marks the 13th charge against Sam Bankman-Fried in a case that continues to draw attention from the cryptocurrency and financial industries.
 
On Tuesday, the Southern District Court of New York revealed a newly unsealed indictment. Bankman-Fried, who posted a bond of $250 million, has already entered a plea of not guilty to eight criminal counts relating to fraud and conspiracy. However, he has yet to be arraigned on five additional counts.
 
Prosecutors say Sam Bankman-Fried is accused of masterminding one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history.
