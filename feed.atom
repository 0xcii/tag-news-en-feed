        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid the long-awaited approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the price of BTC has seen a remarkable surge of 23% over the past fourteen days. 
 
However, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has been at the forefront of the SEC’s crackdown on the crypto industry, has taken a notable stance against the idea of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds for both institutional and retail investors. 
 
Despite acknowledging that Bitcoin is classified as a commodity and not a security, Gensler remains opposed to the investment strategy associated with Bitcoin ETFs. Surprisingly, a recently surfaced video posted on Social Media X (formerly Twitter) has cast doubt on Gensler’s consistent opposition to Bitcoin ETFs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite still being in its nascent phase, the crypto industry is no stranger to differing opinions from maximalists of different cryptocurrencies. This has often led to controversies and debates, some of which are more baseless than others. 
 
The most recent disputes in crypto have been sparked by the back-and-forth between Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, and some members of the XRP community. As a result, an old video has resurfaced of a journalist claiming to possess damaging information against Hoskinson. However, the Cardano founder has wasted no time in calling out the bluff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During his ongoing criminal trial, Sam Bankman-Fried  
(SBF) faced some tough questions from New York prosecutors today (Monday). The  
once prominent figure in the crypto industry found himself cross-examined on  
his past statements and admissions, including derogatory remarks about certain  
crypto investors and comments on crypto regulation. 
The Financial Times reported that during the cross-examination,  
prosecutors presented SBF with tweets, media interviews, and sworn testimony,  
which he claimed were unrelated to the operations of the defunct crypto  
exchange.
Inconsistent Claims 
These statements were in contrast to the  
eventual collapse of the crypto exchange, which left customers with $8  
billion in missing deposits. Notably, SBF admitted to uttering derogatory

Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Has Seen Four Consecutive Positive Changes Now
 
The “mining difficulty” is a feature on the Bitcoin blockchain that controls how hard the miners would find it to hash blocks on the network right now. The metric is measured in terms of how many hashes the miners would need to generate before they can solve the block.
 
The reason this feature exists at all is that the network intends to keep its block production rate (that is, the rate at which miners go through new blocks) at a constant value.
 
When the miners increase their computing power (what’s called the “hashrate“), they become faster at solving blocks. To slow th…]]></summary>

Amongst Bitcoiners, it has also become a derogatory term used to refer to altcoins, as seen in the oft-repeated phrase “Bitcoin, Not Crypto.” However, not everything in the crypto world is truly "crypto," at least not in the literal sense of the name.
The true essence of a cryptocurrency lies in its reliance on cryptography, and nothing else, to secure its network. This brings us to an essential distinction: only proof-of-work coins can be genuinely considered “crypto.” This distinction is not just semantic but fundamentally important, as it underscores what exactly strengthens the ledger.
