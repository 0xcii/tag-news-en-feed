He highlights the potential tax implications of such strategies, emphasizing how they could unintentionally result in increased tax burdens.

The founder added that removing the phrase “increase layer-1 gas limits” entirely sends a clear signal to the market that “Ethereum is not scaling at all.” This decision, the founder continued, is a “punch to the gut for early adopters” who supported Ethereum based on the promise of scalability.
