Trump expressed a deep appreciation for the role of miners in stabilizing the national energy grid and underscored his readiness to support their efforts from the White House.
 
Following the meeting, the Trump campaign posted via Truth Social, “VOTE FOR TRUMP! Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC.

Bitcoin ‘Velocity’ Has Plunged To Historical Lows Recently
 
As explained by CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju in a post on X, Bitcoin’s circulation has recently slowed down. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is “Velocity,” which keeps track of the rate at which the cryptocurrency’s tokens are circulating in the market.
 
 
When the value of this metric is high, the coins move around faster on the network. On the other hand, a low value implies tokens are still inside an address long before being transferred.
