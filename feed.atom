        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trial of the former CEO of defunct crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), is set to begin on October 4 (Jury selection coming up on October 3). In line with this, legal experts have weighed in on how the case could play out once the trial commences.
 
From The Prosecution’s Angle
 
In an interview with Decrypt, these legal experts mentioned that the Prosecution’s proactiveness shows they are confident of securing a conviction. Usually, the prosecution takes time to gather as much evidence as possible before moving to trial to ensure that it secures a conviction. 
 
 
However, in this case, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has moved swiftly to kickstart the trial, which suggests that they have all the arsenal to put Sam Bankman-Fried in jail for a long time.

        <updated>2023-10-02T16:16:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a characteristically bold and provocative post, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has once again stirred the financial world by declaring, "Fiat currency" a scam. Musk, responding to a post asking other X users what they think is a scam so normalized that people don't even realize it is a scam, did not provide further context in the post.
Fiat currency refers to traditional government-issued money, such as the US dollar, euro, or yen, that is not backed by a physical commodity like gold but relies on the trust and authority of the issuing government. Musk's comment adds fuel to the ongoing debate about the role of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in challenging traditional financial systems.
Bitcoin enthusiasts and advocates quickly rallied behind Musk's tweet, interpreting it as an endorsement for the digital currency. They argue that Bitcoin offer an alternative to fiat currency, with advantages of being decentralized and resistant to inflation.
Musk's statement adds to the growing discussion surrounding the role of Bitcoin in modern finance. While his post was brief, it remains to be seen whether Musk will further elaborate on his views regarding fiat currency or if this is another instance of his cryptic and attention-grabbing social media presence. Regardless, the debate over the future of money and the coexistence of traditional and digital currencies is unlikely to subside anytime soon.]]></summary>

“Romantic love is an addiction”, says Dr. Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist at Rutgers University. “My guess is that our modern addictions — nicotine, drugs, sex, gambling — are simply hijacking this ancient brain pathway that evolved millions of years ago, that evolved for romantic love. The brain system evolved to focus your energy on an individual and start the mating process.” 

“It is not that humans have become any more greedy than in generations past. It is that the avenues to express greed have grown so enormously.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash rose to a multi-month high to start the week, as traders pushed the cryptocurrency above a key resistance level. The move came on the heels of the “Uptober” trend, and ahead of a big week of U.S. economic data, headlined by the nonfarm payrolls report. Solana rose to its highest level since mid-August.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was a notable gainer on Monday, as the token rose to a two-month high to start the month.
 
BCH/USD peaked at $246.98 earlier in the day, after trading at a low of $233.74 during Sunday’s session.
 
This was the strongest point that bitcoin cash has hit since July 31, when price reached a high of $259.00
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s move comes after a key resistance level of $245.00 was briefly broken, however bulls have gone on to retreat from earlier positions.
 
One reason for this was a collision that occurred on the relative strength index (RSI), which hit the 70.00 resistance point.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 69.53, with BCH at $243.30 as of writing.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) continued to be a big mover to start the month of October, after extending a recent bull run to a sixth straight day.
 
After hitting a bottom at $22.51 on Sunday, SOL/USD climbed to a high of $24.60 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of this surge, the world’s seventh largest cryptocurrency hit its strongest point since August 15.
 
 
The move sees solana near a key price point of $25.00, with the RSI moving deep into the overbought region in the process.
 
At the time of writing, the index is at the 74.33 position, which is its highest reading since July 17.

It is a foundational concept that enables human action by allowing individuals to satisfy needs and navigate uncertainty. This results in resources being used most efficiently as individuals who own them have a strong interest in doing so. In contrast, the need for a legal definition of property by a central authority such as the state may result in resources being controlled by individuals who do not have a strong interest in using them effectively. This can lead to inefficiencies and abuse, as we can observe worldwide.

Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Have Been Accumulating During Past Month
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the large BTC wallets have accumulated a combined $1.17 billion in the cryptocurrency since the start of last month.
 
The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which keeps track of the total number of coins that each investor cohort in the market is holding right now.
 
The holders or addresses are divided into these groups based on the amount of BTC that they are carrying in their balance currently. The 1-10 coins cohort, for instance, includes all investors holding at least 1 and at most 10 BTC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the FTX hacker transferred 5,000 ethereum (ETH) valued at $8 million in purloined assets, the cybercriminal shifted an additional 25,000 ether, totaling $43.15 million. Yet, even after relocating tens of millions of dollars in ethereum, the FTX wallet drainer still holds a whopping 155,749 ETH, currently valued at slightly above $268 million.
 
FTX Hacker Moves 30,000 Ether
 
In the past three days, the individual responsible for the FTX theft has shifted a total of 30,000 ETH, worth approximately $51.15 million based on current ETH values. Following two initial transfers of 2,500 ETH each, subsequent movements were 1,250 ETH, 2,500 ETH, 1,500 ETH, 4,750 ETH and two separate transfers of 7,500 ETH each.
 
The hacker’s holdings also include 155,749 ETH valued at $268 million, 3.97 million tether (USDT), 1.68 million DAI and 1.57 BTC, along with a variety of other crypto assets and ERC20 tokens. This news emerges as former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried prepares for his October 3 trial, marking the start of jury selection. Some speculate the FTX wallet hack was an inside job, given the timing of the fund transfers.
 
 
In a conversation with reporter Tiffany Fong, Bankman-Fried speculated the perpetrator might be a former employee. “I’ve narrowed it down to like eight people. I don’t know which one it was,” he shared with Fong. The breach was first detected the day FTX declared bankruptcy. Former FTX US General Counsel Ryne Miller noted the team was examining irregularities in FTX account balances. Concurrently, Nansen’s Martin Lee observed significant withdrawals from FTX accounts.

Gensler Doesn’t Know What Security Means
 
In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Deaton stated that despite his academic experience, Gensler doesn’t have a “clue” about what investment contracts (also known as security) mean. He further stated that Gensler continues to feign ignorance that securities laws cannot apply to the “purchase of an asset for non-investment use cases.”
 
 
Deaton was reacting to an old clip where Gensler mentioned that Ether had transformed from a security to a non-security as it had become more decentralized. …]]></summary>

At that time, Assange was not new to Bitcoin. In fact, Wikileaks had discussed accepting Bitcoin since as far back as 2010, when early efforts were made by users to introduce the journalistic agency to the payment method.
Ultimately, Wikileaks began accepting Bitcoin in 2011, a move the organization has since credited for helping break its banking blockade in the wake of its publishing of classified U.S. government information.
