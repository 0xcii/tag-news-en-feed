The developer claims that Ledger Live tracks every move users make, including the apps they install and the crypto they hold.
 
Ledger Live Covertly Tracking User Transaction Activities?
 
Taking to X on December 27, Rekt Builder claims that Ledger Live embeds the genuine check into the app’s listing procedure. As such, it means that whenever you plug in your Ledger device and open Ledger Live, the software checks whether the device is genuine and sends this information to Ledger’s servers. This data includes the device’s serial number, firmware version, and the list of apps installed.
