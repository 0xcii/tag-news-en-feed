        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alexander  
Mashinsky, the  
Founder of the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network was arrested  
today (Thursday) in New York. The arrest comes as the United States Department  
of Justice (DOJ) and several regulators slammed multiple lawsuits against the  
troubled Founder and his company. 
DOJ, SEC,  
CFTC and FTC Head to Court
In the complaint filed by DOJ before the district court in  
New York, United States Attorney Damian Williams unveiled seven counts of  
charges against Mashinksy and Roni Cohen-Pavon, Celsius’ former Chief  
Revenue Officer. These include allegations of securities, commodities and wire  
fraud as well as token  
manipulation.

UPDATE: Per DOJ indictment, legal minds expect Alex Mashinsky to face a lengthy prison sentence. “These (DOJ) charges, and the scale of capital involved, means he doesn’t have a meaningful path to a plea; looking at 15-20 years.”Securities fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy:…
— Andrew (@AP_Abacus) July 13, 2023
The US law enforcement agency accused Mashinky of luring investors by lying about  
Celsius’ financial status and inflating the price of the business’ native token  
CEL. Because the former Celsius CEO ‘falsely portrayed’ Celsius as a 'safe and  
secure institution’, the digital lending business ‘grew exponentially’  
to become one of the biggest crypto lenders in the world, ‘purportedly’  
managing about $25 billion at its peak period in the fall of  
2021.
Finance  
Magnates reported that Celsius, which entered the markets in 2018 through an  
initial coin offering, filed for bankruptcy in July last year, weeks after suspending withdrawal on its platform, citing  
market volatility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a recent ruling handed down by U.S. judge Analisa Torres, the crypto asset XRP is not “necessarily a security on its face.” In the ruling, both parties, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs’ motions for summary judgment were granted in part and denied in part. The order states that the court cannot conclude that XRP is a security as a matter of law.

The judge presiding over the SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs and executives Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse has detailed that the court cannot classify XRP as a security.

Around the early hours of the day, Muneeb Ali, co-founder of the layer-1 blockchain Stacks, tweeted via his Twitter handle that the Bank of America had closed down his personal account with them without giving a definite reason.
 
The Stacks co-founder alleges that this move by the American banking giant was in response to him conducting Bitcoin transactions with Coinbase using that account. In addition, he claims this action should be considered as a declaration of war on Bitcoin and crypto in general.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant legal victory for Ripple, US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple in the lawsuit filed against it by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in December 2020. 
 
The SEC had alleged that Ripple had raised over $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP to investors, which should be classified as securities. 
 
However, the court noted that programmatic XRP sales did not constitute investment contracts, as they lacked the economic reality of institutional sales, which cut in favor of finding “a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon jumped to a five-week high on Thursday, as founders of the token proposed an upgrade that will create a new coin, POL. If approved, MATIC will be replaced with the new token that will function on all Polygon networks. Litecoin also rallied, hitting a one-month high.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) jumped to a multi-week high on Thursday, as traders reacted to the news that some of the project’s founders have proposed replacing the network’s MATIC token.
 
If successful, POL will be the new official token of Polygon, and this news has been boosting the price of MATIC/USD to a peak of $0.7668 today.
 
As a result of this, MATIC moved to its highest point since June 9, when price reached a high at $0.7890.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge in price came after the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 60.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 62.34, with the next visible point of resistance at the 70.00 level.
 
In the event this ceiling is hit, MATIC will likely be trading above $0.8000.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) also surged higher in today’s session, as traders pushed price above the $100.00 mark.
 
Following a low of $94.79 on Wednesday, LTC/USD raced to an intraday peak at $101.45 earlier in the day.
 
Overall, this is the strongest level the token has hit since last Thursday, when it peaked at $105.95.
 
 
The jump comes after bulls rebounded following a breakout below a support point at $95.00, with the RSI hitting a floor of its own at 53.00.
 
Currently, price strength is at a reading of 57.88, with LTC continuing to record higher highs as the day progresses.
 
A ceiling of $102.00 is now the obvious target, and should the price push past this point, there is a good chance LTC hits $105.00 in the coming days.

Sharks & Whales Of Stablecoins Like DAI & USDP Are Accumulating
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, large holders of some stablecoins have been expanding their holdings recently. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which measures what percentage of the total supply of an asset (in this case, a stablecoin) is being held by which wallet groups in the market.
 
The addresses are divided into these wallet groups based on the total number of coins that they are currently carrying in their balances. The 1-10 coins cohort, for instance, includes all addresses holding between 1 and 10 tokens of the asset.

Per the report, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mashinsky and Celsius. In a document filed in the Southern District of New York, the regulator claims that the defendants raised “billions of dollars” by allegedly offering unregistered securities.

The announcement, made through a blog post, introduces POL as a next-generation protocol token that aims to become a major driving force for the coordination and growth of the ecosystem, positioning it as the Value Layer of the Internet.
 
Polygon: MATIC Becomes POL
 
The proposal, outlined in a comprehensive white paper by a group of Polygon founders and researchers, introduces POL as a third-generation native asset, characterized as a hyperproductive token. According to them, POL enhances the functionality of native tokens by allowing validators to validate multiple chains and enabling each chain to offer multiple roles and corresponding rewards to validators.
