The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has accused Bankman-Fried of leaking the diary of Caroline Ellison, a former colleague, and CEO of sister trading firm Alameda Research, who is also a key witness in Bankman-Fried’s upcoming trial.
 
In its request to Judge Lewis Kaplan, the DOJ argues that such leaks have the potential to taint the jury pool and create an environment of harassment that could deter other potential trial witnesses from testifying.

The decision came as a precautionary measure to ensure public safety, and the suspension will remain in effect until relevant agencies can thoroughly assess the project to ensure it is devoid of risk.
 
Prior to the suspension, Kenya boasted a large number of venues, approximately 18, where individuals could visit “Orb” stations to verify their World IDs using the company’s spherical and mirrored iris-scanners.
 
 
However, due to overwhelming demand, the Orb operators moved their stations to the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) to accommodate the large number of people seeking verification.

        <updated>2023-08-02T18:23:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Per a report from Semafor, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has been weighing on the possibility of filing fraud charges against crypto exchange Binance. The company has been in the eye of all major regulators worldwide in 2023 and might be about to face its biggest legal hurdle to date.
 
 
Binance At Risk Of Bank Run?
 
According to people familiar with the matter quoted by Semafor, the DOJ has been reluctant to file fraud charges for fear that this could trigger a “bank run.” In other words, the authorities are allegedly worried for investors and their funds if the crypto company becomes insolvent following a massive capital exodus.
 
If this happens, Binance will become the second major crypto exchange to face a bank run in over a year. In 2022, bankrupt exchange FTX faced a similar situation when reports about its financial state began circulating, leaving thousands of users with their funds “stuck” on the platform.
 
In that sense, the DOJ authorities are looking to implement other options, such as fines or an agreement with the company, Semafor wrote. As of this writing, there is no official statement from Binance or its top executives.
 
The company is currently facing a legal battle with U.S. regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint against the crypto platform and its U.S. subsidiary over allegedly violating securities laws.
 
This has negatively impacted Binance.US market share. If the DOJ proceeds with the fraud charges, the international arm could suffer a similar fate, confirming fears of a major bank run on the platform.
 
On this possibility, pseudonym crypto trader “Hsaka” stated: “The same run they’ve been trying to unsuccessfully ignite for the past few months?”
 
 
As of this writing, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market are negatively reacting to the news with the price of top coins tumbling into critical support levels.

prosecutors are mulling over whether to initiate criminal charges against

“Based on recent events and new information Eric Balchunas and I are officially increasing our spot Bitcoin ETF approval odds to 65%,” Seyffart remarked on Twitter, adding, “that’s from 50% a couple of weeks ago and 1% a few months ago.”
 
Driving this revised prediction are multiple factors, including recent statements from SEC chair Gary Gensler, developments from leading digital asset manager Grayscale, and the SEC’s perceived approval of Coinbase’s Bitcoin exchange.
