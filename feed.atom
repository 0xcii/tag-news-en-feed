        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. Like bitcoin, the four Seasonal Tokens – Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter – are produced by proof-of-work mining and go through regular halvings that make them harder to obtain as time goes on. Once every nine months, the rate of production of one of the tokens is cut in half. That token goes from being produced at the fastest rate of the four tokens, to the slowest.
 
Summer tokens are currently produced at a rate of one token every 4.3 seconds. On the 6th of March, that rate will drop to one token every 8.6 seconds. Summer tokens, which are currently the cheapest of the four, are expected to become the most expensive over the following months as the market adjusts to the lower rate of supply.
 
This process has already happened once before, after the Spring halving in Jun…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The price of Conflux (CFX) is flying high after the network announced last week that it is joining forces with China Telecom to roll out Blockchain SIM (BSIM) cards.
 
At the time of writing, CFX has ballooned to a commanding 310% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. In the last 24 hours, alone the token notched a 32% gain, edging out other top 100 coins.
 
The Conflux network lives true to its moniker, “China’s Polygon (MATIC),” which is synonymous with connections with big-name enterprises.
 
Conflux confirmed on January 24 that it had incorporated Little Red Book, the Chinese equivalent of photo and video sharing app Instagram.  Since then, the relationship has been extremely beneficial for the Chinese cryptocurrency’s robust bullish ascension.
