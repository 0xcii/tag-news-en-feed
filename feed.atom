        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) has experienced an exceptional uptrend, with a staggering year-to-date (YTD) surge of 652%. However, the recent surge in meme coins has further amplified the blockchain’s growth narrative. 
 
Solana-based tokens such as dogfight (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK), and Boof of Meme (BOME) have witnessed remarkable growth rates of 574%, 3200%, and 49%, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. 
 
Nevertheless, this unprecedented meme coin mania has its fair share of ramifications, including increased transaction failures, rising transaction fees, and the dominance of bot-driven activities.
 
Meme Coin Ecosystem Faces Challenges
 
The surge in meme coin popularity is evident through the rise in decentralized exchange (DEX) and meme coin volume on Solana. On March 16th, major meme coins like…]]></summary>

Trezor’s team recently published a preliminary report addressing the concerns. The post also explained the elaborate phishing scam that bypassed the company’s security measures.
 
 
Is Trezor’s “Unwavering Security” Still Protecting Your Crypto?
 
After gaining control of the account, the hacker posted a fake presale address for a $TRZR token. Disguised as an “initiative” to help the Slerf community, the post offered a “separate bonus airdrop” from a website linked in the post that redirected to a wallet drainer.

The year 2024, despite only being three months in, has already been incredibly interesting in this regard as both meme coins rally to new yearly highs.
 
Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Price Performance
 
Taking the year 2024 into account, it seems that Shiba Inu is finally winning the top meme coin battle against Dogecoin. A comparison of prices at the start of the year and now shows that Dogecoin has performed poorly compared to Shiba Inu.
 
 
To put this in perspective, the Shiba Inu price started out the year around $0.000009 and then surged more than 400% in March to $0.000044. The price has since retraced since this and returned to the $0.0…]]></summary>
