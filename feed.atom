In a recently filed court document, the crypto exchange highlighted that $1 billion in assets were moved from the platform following the regulator's temporary restraining order (TRO). The outflow even wiped out 75 percent of the platform revenue, which led to the layoffs.
“In the immediate aftermath of the TRO, we saw somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 billion of assets flee the platform, crypto, and fiat,” Christopher Blodgett, an executive at Binance.US, said in a deposition in December 2023.
