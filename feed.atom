        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-sol-surges-8-as-atom-nears-1-month-high/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-03T16:38:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana was up by almost 8% on Tuesday, as the token rose for a fifth consecutive session. Recent moves have come despite the Christmas and New Year period, where market volumes were somewhat muted. Cosmos was also in the green, as prices rose to a multi-week high.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was one of the notable gainers on Tuesday, as the token climbed by as much as 8% in the day.
 
Following a low of $11.05 on Monday, SOL/USD surged to an intraday peak of $12.02 during today’s session.
 
The move saw solana rise for a fifth straight day, hitting its highest point since December 23 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, Tuesday’s surge comes as SOL moved beyond a ceiling of $11.80, with the relative strength index (RSI) also nearing a resistance point.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 50.83, which is moving towards a major ceiling at the 53.00 mark.
 
This level hasn’t been hit since November 6, when solana was trading above the $30.00 level.
 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
In addition to solana, cosmos (ATOM) was also in the green in today’s session, with price climbing for a third straight day.
 
ATOM/USD raced to a high of $10.22 on Tuesday, which comes less than a day after trading at a low of $9.77.
 
This surge in price has pushed cosmos to its highest point since December 10, with it now nearing a key resistance level also.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, this ceiling is at the $10.50 level, which was last hit on December 5.
 
Recent moves in ATOM have come as the 10-day (red) moving average, crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
This typically is a sign of current and upcoming bullish sentiment, which could see cosmos bulls attempt to take price above $11.00.

The launch of Shibarium, the upcoming L2 scaling solution for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has been teased by Kusama, and many are wondering what this could bring on the table for SHIB in terms of price improvement.

The L2 upgrade has been in development for some time already as the community-run ecosystem distances itself from its memecoin origins. The close implementation of Shibarium brings the SHIB community closer to this goal.

This is an opinion editorial by Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3 and former CSO of Blockstream.

During the event, we announced the Bitcoin Volcano Bonds, while President Bukele made a significant announcement of his own: the creation of Bitcoin City. By legally recognizing bitcoin as tender and establishing Bitcoin City, President Bukele took a bold step toward nationwide adoption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ANC Pharmacy is enabling bitcoin payments via Binance Pay at more than 1,000 locations across Ukraine.
One of the largest pharmacy chains in Ukraine, ANC Pharmacy, has partnered with Binance to enable bitcoin and cryptocurrency payments at all of their locations. With over 1,000 stores across the country, it is one of the largest implementations of bitcoin payments in Europe. 
Access to the contactless payments will initially only be available at locations in Kyiv, per an official statement. In order to use bitcoin to pay for orders starting on January 3, patrons will need to download the Binance application and then complete their purchase at the ANC website with Binance Pay, before picking up their order at the store. 
This is not the first time Binance has partnered with a Ukrainian chain to accept bitcoin payments. Previously, Binance worked with grocery chain VARUS to enable cryptocurrency payments at their stores. Binance also offered a Refugee Crypto Card for Ukranians forced to leave their country as a result of the war with Russia in April of 2022. 
As the war and other recent global events have shown, having sovereign money that is easily transportable and is not tethered to any one country is increasingly important, and educating people about Bitcoin in that region is a vital goal. A Bitcoin Core developer using the technology to help facilitate aid in the region demonstrated the effectiveness of Bitcoin in situations like the one Ukranians are facing. The Human Rights Foundation’s Chief Strategy Officer Alex Gladstein also illustrated the impact Bitcoin was having on the region in May 2022.
