case against FTX's Founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), faced intense  
cross-examination by the defense as she testified against her former boss. The  
trial highlighted complex events that led to the collapse of FTX and  
Alameda Research. 
Ellison, a key witness and SBF's former girlfriend, provided a detailed account of her early days at Alameda Research,  
highlighting the exchange's internal accounting practices. One notable point in  
her testimony, as reported by Coindesk, was Alameda's struggle with  
accountants. From 2021 to 2022, the hedge fund allegedly engaged with several  
accounting firms, only to discover that they were unable or unwilling to audit  
the company's books.

TLDR

Landfills are a significant contributor to global methane emissions, which, if mitigated, could have a greater environmental impact than managing carbon dioxide emissions.
Conventional methane management methods, such as venting and flaring, are inefficient and environmentally damaging, while waste-to-energy solutions, like selling electricity to the grid or distributing renewable natural gas (RNG) via pipelines, often prove economically infeasible for smaller or remote landfills.
Bitcoin mining offers a market-based approach to reducing methane emissions from landfills by converting otherwise wasted pot…]]></summary>
