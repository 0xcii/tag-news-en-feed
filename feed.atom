Yesterday, RippleX tweeted, highlighting the proposal: “Clawback is a newly proposed feature that aims to augment the XRP Ledger’s token asset control capabilities. If the XLS-39 Clawback feature is adopted, it could empower developers with heightened trust and safety parameters for their issued assets.”

How The Chevron Deference Doctrine Affects Ripple’s Case
 
The doctrine provides that courts, in the case of ambiguity, could adopt a federal agency’s interpretation of a statute as far as it sounds plausible. This doctrine was formulated in 1984 in the case of Chevron U.S.A. v.

A little over a fortnight ago, the clutter in Bitcoin’s mempool was quite pronounced, boasting over 500,000 unconfirmed transactions awaiting miner confirmation. However, a notable decline in Ordinal inscription minting three days ago saw bitcoin miners significantly whittle down the number of unconfirmed transactions to 153,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was a notable mover on Tuesday, as the meme coin extended recent declines after a failed move beyond a key resistance level. The drops came as the wider crypto market cap also slipped. It is trading 2.87% lower as of writing. Shiba inu also edged lower in today’s session.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) fell by as much as 3% on Tuesday, as bearish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets.
 
DOGE/USD dropped to a low of $0.06163 earlier in the day, following a high of $0.06329 the day prior.
 
The decline came as the meme coin failed to move beyond a key resistance level at the $0.0640 level.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the downward pressure came after the relative strength index (RSI) slipped below a floor at 47.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 44.37, with the 40.00 mark a potential target for sellers.
 
Should this point be hit, there is a strong possibility that dogecoin will be trading below the $0.06000 region.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
In addition to DOGE, shiba inu (SHIB) also edged lower today, as prices approached a key support point.
 
Following a high at $0.000007479, SHIB/USD declined to a bottom at $0.000007258 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of this surge, the world’s second largest meme coin closed in on a price floor at the $0.00000710 level.
 
 
Whilst SHIB has not hit this point yet, the RSI has collided with a floor of its own at the 43.00 mark.
 
Currently, the index is tracking marginally below this point at 42.88, however should this downward trend continue, SHIB will almost certainly hit $0.00000710 in the coming days.
