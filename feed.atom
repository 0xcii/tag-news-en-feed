Until now, it was unclear which Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) would be included in the upgrade.
 
Most notably, there was controversy at the last meeting over whether proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) would be included to improve the scalability of layer 2 rollups.
 
However, as Tim Beiko from the Ethereum Foundation reports, consensus has now been reached.
 
EIP-4844 is not scheduled until the fall of 2023 with a separate hard fork, meaning the Shanghai upgrade will not be delayed and can remain on the tentative March 2023 schedule.
