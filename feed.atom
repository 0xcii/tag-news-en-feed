This comes on the heels of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving Bitcoin ETFs in January, sparking a surge in investment and renewed calls for a similar move by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
 
 
UK’s Bitcoin ETF Advocacy
 
Bivu Das, Managing Director of Kraken UK, believes Bitcoin ETFs offer a “basic fundamental” for establishing the UK as a true crypto hub. These instruments allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself, potentially offering a more regulated and accessible entry point.

The April event is expected to slash mining rewards on the Bitcoin network in half, making the validation of transactions less lucrative.
 
As of now, miners receive 6.25 BTC for each validated block added to the network. However, the halving will split their revenue to 3.125 BTC for each block. Interestingly, many miners in the United States seem to be making adjustments, including upgrading to more efficient mining computers, to ensure they remain profitable.
