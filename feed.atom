Just a month ago, The New York Times published a malicious article on Bitcoin mining’s energy usage. Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts has repeatedly attacked Bitcoin from a variety of angles, going so far as to launch an “anti-crypto army” targeting Bitcoin as a hazard to consumers, all while misleading the public on the environmental impact of Bitcoin. 
These verbal assaults are not isolated and the examples above represent only a small piece of the uphill climb Bitcoin has to mass adoption. To put it mildly, Bitcoin is disrupting countless industries, making centralized authorities fearful of losing their monopoly on money and the power that accompanies it.

investors' concerns about the future of their positions have led to Bitcoin  
(BTC) on Binance Australia being sold at a significant discount compared to  
competing platforms operating in the country. According to data released on Tuesday, a  
single BTC on Australian Binance costs AUD 9,000 less than on the BTC

34,000, while BTC Markets priced them at AUD 43,000.
Binance Australia Sells  
Bitcoin at a Sizable Discount
Experts  
believe such a large difference is due to the fact that earlier this month,  
Binance informed its Australian consumers that they would not be able to
