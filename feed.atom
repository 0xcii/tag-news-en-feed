        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp rebounded from a two-month low to start the weekend, as prices moved back above a key support point. The token, which fell to its lowest point since January on Friday, rose by as much as 2% on Saturday. Cardano also recovered yesterday’s losses.
 
XRP
 
XRP rose higher to start the weekend, as the token formerly known as ripple rebounded from a two-month low.
 
XRP/USD jumped to an intraday high of $0.3795 earlier in the day, which comes after bottoming out at $0.3664 on Friday.
 
Yesterday’s drop saw XRP fall to its weakest point since January 11, when prices were at a low of $0.3477.
 
 
Looking at the chart, Saturday’s recovery has sent the token back above a long-term floor at $0.3720, which was broken yesterday.
 
Overall, the rebound appears to have taken place as the relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a floor at 43.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 43.48, with the next visible ceiling at the 45.00 mark.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
In addition to XRP, cardano (ADA) was another token to rebound from a multi-month low on Saturday.
 
Following a low of $0.3367 on Friday, ADA/USD moved to a peak of $0.3443 to start the weekend.
 
Similar to xrp above, yesterday’s move saw cardano fall to its lowest level since January 11.
 
 
Overall, ADA is now trading over 1.3% higher than this bottom, climbing back above a recent support point in the process.
 
Cardano is now trading at $0.3418, which is higher than the aforementioned floor at $0.3400.
 
The rebound in price comes despite the 14-day RSI continuing to track near an eight-week low of its own at 38.76.

In his recent digital asset analysis, McGlone cited the US Federal Reserve’s hawkish inflation-curbing strategy as the primary factor that could exert downward pressure on risk assets like digital assets.
 
 
The analyst noted that the crypto bear market is far from over while advising buy-and-hold investors to seek protective insurance against asset devaluation. He also said that the recent bounce back by digital assets rendered them susceptible to future price downturns.
