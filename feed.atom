Scrolling through my timeline, I noticed a guy who said I orange-pilled him a while back. He was into drugs and gambling at the time. He heard me preach about Bitcoin and he got into it with near religious fervor. 
Then, under the influence of micro-dosing Orange-Pill Truth, some natural sunshine, bitter reality, and the sweet high of Orange Enlightenment, his life turned around. He overcame his drugs and gambling addiction and became a Bitcoin Maximalist. 
This makes perfect sense — and it speaks to Bitcoin’s greater role in society than just being Perfect Money.

Until recently, Hong Kong operated with a relatively loose regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. This attracted a flood of crypto exchanges, some with questionable practices. To combat this Wild West atmosphere, the SFC implemented a licensing regime in February 2024.
 
The grace period for unlicensed exchanges to comply ended on May 31st, prompting a mass exodus. Big names like Bybit, GateHK, and Huobi Hong Kong were forced to shut down operations or leave the r…]]></summary>
