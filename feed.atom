        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a lot of noise has been made around the Lightning vulnerability recently disclosed by Antoine Riard. Many people are claiming the sky is falling, that Lightning is fundamentally broken, and nothing could be further from the truth. I think part of the problem is that people don't really understand how this vulnerability works, firstly, and secondly many people don't understand how this individual vulnerability overlaps with other known issues on the Lightning Network that have known solutions. 
So first, let's go through and try to understand the vulnerability itself. When a Lightning payment is routed across the network, one thing that is key to understand is how the timelocks for refunding a failed payment work. The hop closest to the receiver has a timelock of 'x', and every hop going…]]></summary>

Top Crypto Mining Stocks Outperforming BTC
 
A first glance at the stocks of the most popular crypto-mining firms shows that the crypto-mining industry is also having a field day as they boast impressive YTD gains. For example, according to data from MarketWatch, the stock of the biggest Bitcoin miner by market cap, Riot Blockchain, has risen by over 185% year-to-date.

technology appeared on the scene promising to revolutionize industries, upset  
conventional institutions, and usher in a new era of transparency and  
democratization. It has demonstrated its potential in a variety of industries

as the initial excitement has worn off, questions have arisen regarding whether  
blockchain innovation has genuinely delivered on its early promises or has  
stagnated in subsequent years.
The Initial  
Interest
The journey of  
blockchain began in 2009 with the launch of Bitcoin by an unnamed entity known

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently attracted considerable attention in the crypto market, thanks to a sudden surge in whale movements over the past weekend. Crypto whales, a term used to describe individuals or entities that hold large amounts of cryptocurrencies, have notably contributed to a significant upsurge in SHIB tokens within their wallets. 
 
According to data provided by IntoTheBlock, SHIB whales amassed a staggering 4.52 trillion SHIB tokens, marking an astonishing 2,300% increase from the figures observed on Friday.
 
The implications of such pronounced whale activity on the price of Shiba Inu tokens have become a topic of intense speculation within the crypto community. With the surge in SHIB tokens being added to whale accounts, the market sentiment has been notably impacted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They say time heals all wounds – not in Bitcoin.
As documented by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo, tomorrow marks the 12th anniversary of a now-infamous tweet by Nick Allen back in 2011, one that demonstrates the remarkable growth and resilience of the cryptocurrency over the past decade.
The tweet in question, posted on October 25, 2011, by technologist Nick Allen, expressed disbelief at Bitcoin's value, which was "down to $2.70 a pop." Allen went on to say he was "so glad I didn't buy in on that mess."
At the time of the tweet, Bitcoin was trading at $2, and it's up some 1,600,000 percent since that date.
Fast forward to today, and Bitcoin's price has soared to nearly $35,000 per coin, marking a phenomenal increase from the days when it was valued in the single digits. Allen's tweet has since become a symbol of how the cryptocurrency has defied expectations and evolved into a mainstream asset class.
 
         
         
         
        Allen's responded to the post in 2021, at a time when Bitcoin was down from $60,000 all-time highs. 
    
Nick Allen, who has an extensive background in the gaming and esports industry, may not have anticipated the extraordinary growth of Bitcoin when he posted his tweet, but the incredible price increase highlights the digital currency's journey and the increasing interest in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate investment vehicle.
Still, as recent news stories show, Allen is not alone when it comes to believing Bitcoin is a fad whose best days are behind it. While some are excited about the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, there has been a continued barrage of news stories in the wake of the FTX trial that take a similar tone.
In this way, Allen's tweet may serve as a reminder that Bitcoin has a history of defying its doubters – and rewarding its investors.]]></summary>
