        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ada-climbs-to-11-week-high-as-crypto-markets-react-to-us-gdp-data/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-26T16:31:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano raced to an 11-week high on Thursday, as markets reacted to data showing that gross domestic product in the U.S. rose by 2.9%. The token rose by as much as 5% earlier in the day, climbing to its strongest point since November. Monero was also in the green, nearing a key resistance level in the process. 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) rebounded on Thursday, with prices moving to an eleven-week high in the process.
 
Following a low of $0.3537 on Wednesday, ADA/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.3866 earlier today.
 
As a result of this, cardano rose to its strongest point since November 8, which is the last time prices were above $0.4100.
 
 
Looking at the chart, ADA has moved lower from earlier gains, as traders appear to have taken profits near a ceiling of $0.3875.
 
As of writing, the token is trading at $0.3774, with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) near a resistance of its own at 74.00.
 
The index, which is currently tracking at 69.22, will likely need to move past the 74.00 point in order for ADA jump over the $0.3875 hurdle.
 
 
Monero (XMR)
 
In addition to ADA, monero (XMR) also surged earlier in the day, as it edged closer to a key resistance level.
 
XMR/USD moved to a peak of $178.15 earlier in the day, which comes less than a day after falling to a low of $169.84.
 
Today’s surge sent monero closer to its long-term resistance level at $180.00, which was last broken on Sunday.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) is currently hovering below a ceiling of its own at 65.00, with a current reading of 63.25.
 
In order for bulls to take XMR back above the $180.00 level, price strength will first need to surpass the 65.00 mark.

This is an opinion editorial by Jimmy Song, a Bitcoin developer, educator and entrepreneur and programmer with over 20 years of experience.
We need beliefs. Belief is something that we live for, something that informs our morals, something that defines our metaphysical existence. We need belief because we need purpose. Belief is a necessary part of a fulfilling life and, traditionally, people valued their beliefs more than anything else. Sadly, fiat money debases our beliefs the same way Nickleback debases music and Joel Osteen debases Christianity. 
The end result of fiat money is that those who win don't believe in anything, at least in any traditional…]]></summary>

Wednesday, the account released a tweet announcing the debut of the suspicious coin on BSC, with an initial price of $0.005. An analysis of the token reveals that creator and tokenomics information are missing.
 
 
Other social media profiles of Robinhood were also targeted. According to a BSC analysis provided by internet inspector ZackXBT, the fraudsters were able to extract around $8,200 worth of BNB tokens.

        <updated>2023-01-26T13:38:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rallied back above $23,000 on Thursday, following the release of Tesla’s quarterly earnings report. The report showed that Tesla was holding 9,720 bitcoin, worth $223 million. Ethereum was also higher, as prices were back above $1,600, rebounding from recent losses in the process.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved to a fresh five-month high earlier in the session, as markets reacted to Tesla’s latest quarterly earnings report.
 
The report, which was released after yesterday’s closing bell, showed that the electric vehicle maker did not sell any of its bitcoin.
 
Following the news, BTC/USD raced to a high of $23,722.10, hitting its strongest point since August 17 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move saw BTC once again break out of a ceiling at $23,500, and this comes after colliding with a floor at $22,500.
 
Earlier gains have somewhat eased, with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) back in overbought territory.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 80.77, with a support point at 78.00 the next visible target.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also rebounded in today’s session, with prices moving back above the $1,600 level.
 
ETH/USD, which slipped to a bottom of $1,535.00 on Wednesday, raced to a peak of $1,632.24 later in the day, following Tesla’s earnings call.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency rose past its recent resistance point at $1,600.
 
 
Like with BTC, previous bulls have somewhat abandoned their positions, opting to take profits as prices reentered overbought territory.
 
Ethereum’s 14-day RSI is currently sitting at 67.07, and appears to be heading for a ceiling at the 75.00 mark.
 
Should this occur, it is likely that ETH will collide with a ceiling at $1,685.
