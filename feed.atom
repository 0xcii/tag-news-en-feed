Justin Sun’s Tron and its native TRX token have been on a bullish run over the last year. It has risen almost 200% from its 2023 lows of $0.05, and this has sent its market cap rocking. At the same time, the Dogecoin price has failed to follow this growth path, and has instead stalled.

When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is greater than that on Binance right now. Such a trend implies either the buying pressure on the former is higher than the latter or the selling pressure is lower.

When Bitcoin first launched, mining rewards were 50 BTC. Currently, that figure is 6.25 BTC, and after the next halving, it will be reduced to 3.125 BTC.
 The halving occurs every 210,000 blocks rather than on pre-specified dates, but this corresponds to a roughly four-year cycle, which means that the next reduction in issuance should reach us this April. Notably, a glance at BTC’s price action since inception reveals a repeating pattern of vertical gains, deep corrections, and drawn-out recoveries, and this sequence appears to correspond closely with the halvings, leading among bitcoin traders to an entrenched belief in halving-driven movements.
