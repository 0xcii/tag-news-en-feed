        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A U.S. court has dismissed the lawsuit filed by BitGo against Galaxy Digital in relation to a failed merger previously agreed to in 2021.
In the company’s response to the terminated merger agreement, BitGo had alleged that Galaxy Digital failed to uphold their end of the bargain, saying the company “intends to hold Galaxy Digital legally responsible for its improper decision to terminate the merger agreement,” with a lawyer representing the company adding that “Either Galaxy owes BitGo a $100 million termination fee as promised or it has been acting in bad faith and faces damages of that much or more.”
At the time of termination, Galaxy Digital cited BitGo's failure to deliver audited financial statements for 2021 that complied with the requirements of the agreement. According to court documents released June 9, this was a “valid basis” for the decision to end the merger, and it effectively voided the termination fee.
“We’re pleased with the court’s decision to dismiss BitGo’s claims,” A statement made by Galaxy Digital on Twitter read. “Now is the time for all of us to work together and focus on the task at hand: Upgrading the global financial system in a manner that promotes innovation and protects investors and consumers alike.”
Just last week, it was announced that BitGo reached a preliminary agreement to acquire its primary U.S. competitor, Prime Trust. Although the details of that merger have not yet been made public, the industry had widely speculated in recent days that Prime Trust faced financial troubles. As such, the agreement has been seen as a relatively good thing, avoiding what many thought may be a coming failure of another large firm.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last Saturday, over 500 people gathered in the Argentine Polo Field to create the largest human ₿ in the world in celebration of the 10th anniversary of NGO Bitcoin Argentina. The event aimed to showcase the technology's ability to mobilize people in defense of monetary freedom, privacy, and other values of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The human ₿, sitting at a massive 40 meters, became the world's largest bitcoin symbol. Jimena Vallone, director of Bitcoin Argentina, expressed hopes that this would be the first of many attempts to break the record.

Congressman Warren Davidson has been particularly vocal in his criticism of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and has called for his removal.
 
 
“Time For Real Reform”, Good For Crypto?
 
In a recent statement, Congressman Davidson claimed that he believes the SEC’s actions against the crypto industry are unjust and that the U.S. capital markets must be protected from a “tyrannical” chairman. He has introduced the SEC Stabilization Act, which aims to restructure the agency and remove Gary Gensler as its chair.

7-Day Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Reached A New All-Time High
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the 7-day hashrate has now hit a new ATH of 381 EH/s. The “mining hashrate” is an indicator that measures the total amount of computing power connected to the Bitcoin blockchain by the miners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Block Green, a Switzerland-based Bitcoin liquidity protocol, and Merkle Standard, a U.S. Bitcoin mining company, have announced a partnership that allows Merkle Standard to utilize Block Green's platform to hedge future revenue risks and access immediate liquidity at “transparent and favorable rates.”
According to a press release, by facilitating mining rewards streaming agreements and employing Bitcoin script and custodial solutions, the platform unlocks opportunities for Bitcoin holders and miners, redefining the financing landscape and empowering participants with new market avenues.
The capabilities of Block Green's platform enable mining operators to sell exposure to their future revenues at a discount, addressing their liquidity needs effectively. Additionally, BTC holders can benefit from the platform, enjoying an attractive BTC-native return.
As part of the partnership, Merkle Standard plans to sell exposure to 100 PH/s of hashrate over a 30-day period, receiving 7.5 BTC in immediate upfront liquidity. Luxor Tech, a mining software and services company, is among the LPs that have filled the trade.
Sebastien Hess, CEO at Block Green, expressed excitement about the partnership, stating, "Our platform empowers Bitcoin miners to unlock and access future liquidity and hedge revenue risks, driving growth capital coupled with risk mitigation for sophisticated mining operations."
Head of Research at Merkle Standard, Holden Guillies, shared the enthusiasm, emphasizing the innovative nature of the collaboration, saying, "This innovative financial product provides us with a new way to manage risk by hedging mining difficulty while gaining upfront liquidity. We believe this partnership offers an essential tool to effectively plan, operate, and execute within the fast-moving Bitcoin mining industry."]]></summary>
