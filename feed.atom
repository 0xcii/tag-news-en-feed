        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin has surged past the $50,000 mark today, according to CoinMarketCap data, reaching this milestone for the first time since December 2021. 
 
         
         
         
        
CoinMarketCap
 
    
The breakthrough marks a significant recovery for Bitcoin, which faced massive volatility and fluctuations over the last couple years, reaching lows of around $16,000. Bitcoin's resilience and upward trajectory underscore its status as a store of value and a hedge against inflation in todays grim economic landscape.
Investors are closely monitoring Bitcoin's price movements, with many viewing the $50,000 level as a crucial psychological barrier. The surge in Bitcoin's price reflects renewed confidence in the asset's long-term potential and its ability to attract institutional investment.



This year's upward price movement has been mainly fueled by spot Bitcoin ETF demand, which is seeing adoption by mainstream financial institutions and increasing retail investor participation. The immense amount of selling pressure by Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF, in addition to miners selling off coins, appears to now be almost exhausted. So now with the inflows for all the other spot Bitcoin ETFs accelerating, buying demand is far exceeding any current selling pressure.
Also, with the halving event quickly approaching for Bitcoin, market participants have been vocal about eagerly buying up BTC before the mining reward gets cut in half, which is expected to create a supply shock later in the year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
We live in a highly digitalized world, but most of humanity still uses physical goods to store value. The most used store of value in the world is real estate. It is estimated that approximately 67% of global wealth is held in property. Recently, however, macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds have highlighted the weaknesses of real estate as a physical store of value. What to do if a war breaks out? What happens if a home that was used as a store of value is destroyed?
In German, real estate translates to “Immobilie,” which literally means “to be immobile.” Owning real estate creates a local dependency that can pose a problem in a world of ever-increasing conflict and radicalization. In the event of war, you cannot take real estate with you and it can be easily destroyed.

This remarkable rally can be attributed to three critical factors: the influx of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, bullish signals from the options market, and supportive trends in the futures market.
 
 
#1 Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows
 
The notable rise in Bitcoin’s price past $50,000 has been significantly influenced by the surge in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, a trend marked by increasing institutional demand. Outflows from Grayscale continue to slow, while ETF inflows for BlackRock, Fidelity and the others remain massive.

The “Percent Supply in Profit” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total percentage of the Bitcoin supply carrying some unrealized gain.
