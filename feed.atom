On-chain analysis firm Santiment has shed light on the remarkable surge in new daily addresses created for Shiba Inu, surpassing a staggering 2,500 per day (on average) over the past couple of weeks. This surge in activity has propelled SHIB into the spotlight, making i…]]></summary>

According to reports, Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley has downgraded Coinbase because of its ongoing legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the continued vagueness around US regulation of cryptocurrencies.
 
The Piper Sandler analyst maintains an Overweight rating on COIN shares because they believe there is “too much uncertainty to prudently project revenues in future years.”
 
 
From overweight to neutral, Moley lowered Coinbase’s rating and forecast a drop of 25% from the crypto exchange’s current market price. The stock is currently trading at approximately $77, while the investment bank’s most r…]]></summary>

On May 25, Binance initially suspended the deposit of 10 Multichain-bridged tokens due to days-long delays in transaction time on the Multichain protocol.
 
A few days later, the debacle worsened when Multichain announced it could not contact its CEO Zhaojun.
 
As a result of its CEO being inaccessible, the team behind Multichain stated they couldn’t obtain the necessary server keys for the maintenance of some nodes, which affected the cross-chain operations of various networks, including ONUS, Omax, Findora, etc.
