In a petition submitted on September 27, the defendants are nudging the court to reject the SEC’s request to transport Do Kwon to the US for questioning over his alleged involvement in the crash of the Terra ecosystem. 
 
Back in February, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Terraform Labs and its co-founder and CEO Do Hyeong Kwon, accusing both parties of orchestrating a multi-billion dollar fraud by promoting investment in an inter-connected suite of crypto asset securities, which included the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and digital asset LUNA.

While the bank cites concerns over scams and fraud as the rationale behind this move, critics argue that it contradicts the United Kingdom’s crypto policy objectives. 
 
Jesper Johansen, founder and CEO of crypto service provider Northstake, expressed his reservations about the decision in an interview with Blockworks, stating:
 
 
“Firstly, this ban contradicts the UK government’s stated policy goal to develop favorable conditions and a supportive environment for crypto businesses to set up and scale their services.”  
 
This divergence from national policy goals raises questions about the bank’s commitment to the country’s evolving crypto landscape.

Layer one or L1 refers to a base blockchain protocol like Bitcoin or Ethereum. These networks operate on a decentralized ledger secured by proof-of-work (PoW) mining or proof-of-stake (PoS) staking. L1 chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum offer unparalleled security. However, during peak times, both of these chains grapple with sluggish transaction speeds and steep fees.
