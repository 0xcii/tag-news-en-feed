        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stellar surged by as much as 7% on Monday, despite sentiment in crypto markets being mostly bearish to start the week. The token rallied for a second straight session, after a recent collision with a key price floor. Toncoin also rose, hitting a fresh multi-month high. 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
XLM was one of Monday’s biggest movers, as the cryptocurrency rose by as much as 7% in today’s session.
 
After trading at a low of $0.1147 on Sunday, XLM/USD moved to an intraday peak of $0.126 earlier in the day.
 
This surge sees stellar climb higher for a second consecutive day, following a rebound from a floor at $0.110.
 
 
Earlier gains have already begun to ease, which comes due to the relative strength index (RSI) colliding with a ceiling of 49.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 49.48, with the next point of resistance around 54.00.
 
Overall, bulls seem to have set their sights on the $0.135 level.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) also moved higher to start the week, with the token hitting a fresh multi-month high in the process.
 
TON/USD peaked at $1.93 on Labor Day, which comes following a low of $1.85 during Sunday’s session.
 
As a result of the move, toncoin climbed to its strongest point since May 8, when the price reached a high of $2.08.
 
 
The RSI on TON continues to reside over the 70.00 mark, meaning that price strength remains overbought.
 
This has not prevented bulls from continuing to send the token higher, with the $2.00 level the perceived target for traders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple’s strategic direction with the XRP token has historically always been a subject of intense scrutiny and discussion. Recent developments suggest a potential pivot in Ripple’s long-term vision for XRP.
 
Historically, the company’s ambition for XRP was grand. Statements from six years ago, recently unearthed by the XRP community, reveal Ripple’s aspiration to position XRP as a world reserve currency. In both an unearthed blog post by the fintech and a speech from CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the company laid out its vision for XRP.
 
 
$XRP  |  RESERVE CURRENCY
 
We didn’t make this up. Since the beginning @Ripple has stated $XRP is set to become the World’s Reserve Currency.

of its virtual asset service provider (VASP) license in Hong Kong. The exchange is  
expecting to receive the approval by March 2023. Hong Kong adopted a pro-crypto

In a recent interview, Li Zhikai, OKX’s Global Chief Commercial Officer, discussed the  
exchange’s preparations, including engaging with banks and undergoing essential  
technological integrations.
Hong Kong’s journey  
towards becoming a crypto-friendly jurisdiction commenced in 2023 when it

Cardano didn’t have the best of times in August, as the cryptocurrency’s price only saw decline, and so far, September hasn’t proved to be anything different, with the asset continuing to traverse sideways near the same $0.25 low that it had dropped to at the end of last month.

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was trading below $26,000 on Labor Day, as volume in the cryptocurrency market was mostly lower.
 
BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $25,817.03 to start the week, following a high of $26,087.15 the day prior.
 
The decline pushed bitcoin closer to a collision with support at $25,600, however bulls have so far rejected this retracement.

The uncertainty stems from a combination of factors, including the latest decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and broader macroeconomic concerns.
 
August concluded with Bitcoin experiencing a setback as it relinquished its gains following the SEC’s decision to delay its ruling on a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). 
 
This regulatory delay has raised questions about the timing of potential mainstream adoption of Bitcoin investment vehicles.

According to Noelle Acheson, the author of “Crypto is Macro Now,” investors should closely monitor the growing US budget deficit.

Yet, challenges faced by crypto, Web3, and blockchain technologies in 2022 prompted the need for fresh perspectives and strategies to clarify and elevate their value proposition to the real economy.

Both crypto related events as well as notable macro data are very scarce this week. The most important macro data are the ISM Services PMI (on Wednesday 10:00 am EST) and the initial jobless claims (on Thursday at 8:30 am EST). However, neither event is likely to have a significant impact on the dollar index (DXY) and thus Bitcoin and crypto.
 
Due to this, we are making an exception this Monday and looking at the entire month of September rather than the upcoming seven days in our weekly preview. September holds several extremely important events in store, and could also provide a few surprises.
