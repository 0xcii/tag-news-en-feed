Ripple Moves 900 Million Tokens Back To Escrow
 
On June 1, Ripple carried out one of its scheduled token unlocks of 1 billion XRP tokens. These unlocks are already set ahead of time to ensure that there is a controlled release of supply into the market, allowing investors to anticipate what was coming.
 
 
These tokens are brought into supply based on the demand and growth in the market, and sometimes not all of the tokens are utilized, which means the unused coins go back into escrow. This was the case this time around as only 10% of the entire 1 billion unloc…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ada-snaps-losing-streak-as-nonfarm-payrolls-beat-expectations/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-02T15:44:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano ended a four-day losing streak on Friday, as markets responded to the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report. Payrolls in May rose to 339,000, which was significantly higher than the expected sum of 190,000. Solana collided with a key resistance level in today’s session.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was one of Friday’s notable gainers, as the token snapped a key resistance level.
 
ADA/USD rose by as much as 3% in today’s session, hitting an intraday high of $0.3777 as a result.
 
This rally resulted in the 10-day (red) moving average crossing over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Typically such an upwards crossover signals the start of a bull run, and it comes as the relative strength index (RSI) also rose considerably.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 50.91, which is marginally below a resistance level at 52.00.
 
In the event this ceiling is broken, there is a strong chance that ADA will move towards the $0.3800 mark.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) also climbed higher in today’s session, with prices colliding with a key resistance level in the process.
 
Following a low of $20.38 on Thursday, SOL/USD surged to a peak at $21.30 earlier in the day.
 
Since hitting the aforementioned ceiling at $21.30, momentum has somewhat weakened, due to bulls securing earlier gains.
 
 
Another reason for this is that the RSI is close to a resistance level of its own at 55.00, leading traders to act more tentatively.
 
The index is currently tracking at 53.64, and should it eventually cross the hard line at 55.00, bullish pressure will likely increase.
 
Some may expect this to happen over the weekend, as traders continue to digest today’s economic data.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the cryptocurrency has seen cumulative fees of just 53,800 BTC since the last halving. The “halving” here refers to a periodic event where the block rewards (that is, the rewards that the miners receive for solving blocks on the network) are permanently cut in half.
 
The halvings are always quite significant for Bitcoin as the block rewards are the only way new BTC is produced/minted, so their being halved tightens the production of the asset.

You may have heard about how you can use bitcoin to buy a house, rent an apartment or save your wealth in an inflation-resistant way to make a down payment. But, beyond these examples, how else can Bitcoin transform the way real estate transactions work as a whole? 
From cutting out middlemen to creating new collateral opportunities, Bitcoin can transform the traditional real estate industry in ways we never imagined. For instance, imagine buying a house without the need for banks or intermediaries, and completing the transaction within minutes instead of weeks. It may sound like a futuristic concept, but it’s slowly becoming a reality.
