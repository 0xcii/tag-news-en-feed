        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a turbulent ride recently, facing a continuous sharp drop to $38,500 from January 12th until January 24th, which experienced a recovery of the $40,000 level. 
 
Several factors have contributed to this volatility, including the trading launch of the Bitcoin spot in the US Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which led to significant selling pressure from asset manager Grayscale, and concerns surrounding the unlocking and repayment of Mt.

According to Chainalysis, a firm specializing in blockchain analysis, there has been a notable increase in cyber attacks to a total of 20 over the past year.
 
These incidents have been linked to operatives from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), who have managed to extract just over $1 billion in crypto through these exploits. This figure represents a 40% drop from the $1.7 billion stolen in 2022, suggesting a shift in the landscape of digital asset theft.

In a new post on X, CryptoQuant CEO and founder Ki Young Ju discusses how the derivatives market has been the driving force behind recent price action in BTC.
 
The analyst has cited the “spot vs derivatives trading volume ratio” indicator to showcase this. The “trading volume” refers to a metric that keeps the total amount of Bitcoin involved in some kind of trading activity daily on a given exchange or group of exchanges.
