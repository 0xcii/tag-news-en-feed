Chomsky is a controversial figure, but he's also a hero for his writings on consent and conformity, and he was perhaps the most articulate in calling out the development of the deep state. Now 95 years old, he had a massive stroke last year and can no longer speak. This article isn't really about him, but it is inspired by him. Bitcoin is an electronic peer-to-peer cash system that is working, but the world we've built around it is incredibly alienated and disconnected from the rest of society. We've been effectively siloed, and anyone who thinks this will help adoption is dreaming. I think the room stinks and that this little Bitcoin world isn't working for Bitcoin.

This move comes after claims of theft and money laundering, showing how hard it is to regulate digital currencies.
 
 
Tether And The ‘Pig Butchering’ Trap 
 
Elliptic, a company that studies blockchains, says that Huione Group has been involved in “pig-butchering” scams. This is a type of scam in which scammers get people to trust them before getting them to invest in fake schemes. People say that the company is involved in illegal deals worth about $11 billion and mostly uses Tether’s USDT stablecoin to do business through Telegram.
