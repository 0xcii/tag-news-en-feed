        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency  
exchange Bitget has enhanced the security of its platform wallets through an  
upgrade to Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology. MPC aims to boost wallet  
protections using distributed computing, homomorphic encryption, and a Trusted  
Execution Environment (TEE).
Bitget Upgrades Wallets  
with Advanced Security Technology
The  
technology implemented by Bitget works by dividing private keys into segments  
across multiple servers. Transactions can then occur without keys being  
revealed in one place. TEE also provides hardware-level security to fortify the  
wallet infrastructure. The upgrade  
follows Bitget's ongoing efforts to implement new security solutions. The  
company previously launched  
an MPC-enhanced wallet to protect users' digital assets.

The Sentencing after a Long Wait
Scott was sentenced yesterday (Thursday) by Judge Edgardo Ramos of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, following multiple postponements. The prosecutors sought a harsher sentencing of 17 years, whereas the defense lawyers tried to bring it down to five years.
The lawyer was one of the first high-profile individuals associated with OneCoin, considered one of the largest crypto scams, to face the legal trail. He was a mastermind behind laundering a staggering amount using multiple accounts to funnel them through the Cayman Islands an…]]></summary>

Part I: General Roadmap To Spot ETF
 
Johnsson begins his analysis by emphasizing the importance of understanding the general regulatory path for a digital asset to transition into a spot ETF offering.

Historically, Bitcoin has been highly correlated with traditional asset classes, particularly the Nasdaq 100, due to its association with risk-on sentiment and speculative trading. However, this recent divergence could signal a shift in their relationships.
 
Several factors could be behind this decoupling. The rise of institutional investors in the crypto market has led to a more diverse set of participants and a broader range of inve…]]></summary>
