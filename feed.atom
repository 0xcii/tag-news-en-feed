        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former president Donald Trump is doubling down on his pro-Bitcoin stance, arguing that the USA must lead in Bitcoin and crypto or risk falling behind. Trump has emerged as a vocal Bitcoin advocate while campaigning for the 2024 election.
Trump became the first US president to accept Bitcoin lightning payments and oppose central bank digital currencies. On the campaign trail, he has promised to keep regulators away from Bitcoin if elected.
Yesterday in Wisconsin, Trump further declared he will "end Joe Biden's war on crypto" to secure America's future. He added new comments that "We will ensure that the future of crypto and the future of Bitcoin will be made in America, otherwise other countries are going to have it."

JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Donald Trump says "to further secure America's future and create opportunity for young people, I will end Joe Biden's war on crypto."

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 18, 2024
  
  
  
This marks a shift. Trump explicitly states that he wants the USA to lead in Bitcoin; otherwise, rivals will surpass it.
Trump's embrace of Bitcoin reflects Bitcoin's game theory. As Bitcoin grows too popular to ban, politicians realize they must support it to court Bitcoin-friendly voters.
The USA risks falling behind in the technological and financial race if it shuns Bitcoin and crypto innovation. Trump understands the USA must lead in this critical new domain.
Whether sincerely supportive or opportunistic, Trump grasps Bitcoin's political capital. He knows backing Bitcoin can win votes, while attacking it risks alienating a passionate base.
Other nations are pursuing pro-Bitcoin policies to attract economic growth and talent. To stay competitive, America must become a welcoming hub for Bitcoin and crypto developments.]]></summary>

The order issued on 4 June 2024 highlighted that Binance.US “has not continued to meet the qualifications or satisfy the requirements that apply to an applicant for a new money transmission license.”
Justifying the move, the regulator noted that the license cancellation was “necessary and appropriate in the public interest for the protection of citizens to restrain unlawful acts, practices, or transactions.”

This decision marks an important victory for Ethereum and could serve as a critical reference point for the treatment of digital assets under US securities law.
 
Ethereum Is Not A Security
 
In 2018, the SEC made a key distinction that Ether was not a security. However, by 2023, amidst evolving functionalities and the transition to Ethereum 2.0, the SEC revisited this stance, hinting at possible regulatory oversight. This shift led to increased scrutiny and uncertainty within the Ethereum community, culminating in a lawsuit filed by Consensys on April 25, 2024. T…]]></summary>

In a recent social media post, Peterson suggested that the network’s expanding difficulty, a key metric that measures the computational effort required to mine new blocks on the blockchain, could pave the way for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 by the end of the year.
