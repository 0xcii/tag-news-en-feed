        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There might be some hope for Silicon Valley Bank to spring back to life.
 
Twitter and Tesla big boss Elon Musk hinted at the possibility of the social media behemoth purchasing the beleaguered Silicon Valley Bank.
 
“I think Twitter should buy SVB and become a digital bank,” tweeted Min-Liang Tan in the face of the ongoing chaos. Tan is cofounder and CEO of Razer, a company that sells gaming computers.
 
Elon Musk responded to Tan’s tweet by stating:
 

 “I’m open to the idea.”
 
On Friday, US regulators announced the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and seized all of the institution’s assets.
 
 
I think Twitter should buy SVB and become a digital bank.

Major Crypto Exchanges Suspend USDC Trades as Concerns Mount
 
On March 11, 2023, stablecoin assets are having a rough day after Circle Financial announced that $3.3 billion of the cash backing usd coin (USDC) was held at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). This news has caused USDC to depeg from the U.S. dollar, dropping to a low of $0.877 per coin on Saturday. As of 7:45 a.m. ET, USDC is currently trading at $0.91 p…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana rebounded from a two-month low to start the weekend, as bulls reentered the market to buy the recent dip. Overall, the global crypto market cap is currently trading 1.8% higher, following a nearly 10% drop on Friday. Polygon was another notable mover, as price rose by nearly 7% on Saturday.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana was back in the green to start the weekend, as bulls reappeared following Friday’s red wave.
 
Following a low of $16.19 in yesterday’s session, SOL/USD moved to an intraday peak of $18.85 on Saturday.
 
The move sees solana climb above a recent floor at $17.30, moving away from its weakest point since January 13 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this was helped by the relative strength index (RSI), which found a point of support at the 30.00 level.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 32.85, which despite the rebound, remains deep in bearish territory.
 
The momentum of the 10-day (red) moving average continues to trend downwards, which could be a sign that there could be more turbulence ahead.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
In addition to solana, polygon (MATIC) also rebounded from a multi-month low during Saturday’s session.
 
MATIC/USD jumped by nearly 7% earlier in the day, hitting a high of $1.09, after dropping to $0.9545 on Friday.
 
This was the lowest point for the token since the last week of January, and led to price strength moving deep into bear territory.
 
 
The RSI for MATIC is now tracking at 35.00, following a move to 32.00 during yesterday’s session.
 
Overall, polygon is down nearly 12% in the last week, however it appears that it could be on course to finding a floor.
 
Should this be the case, there could be some long-term bulls rushing in to buy the current dip.

This is an opinion editorial by Mitch Klee, an analyst at the mining management platform Foreman.
After China banned bitcoin mining in May 2021, nearly 75% of global hash rate was dispersed and relocated to other countries such as Kazakhstan, Russia, the United States and Canada. Since the seemingly-devastating mining ban took hold in the mining hotbed of China almost two years ago, the landscape of Bitcoin mining has dramatically changed. Remarkably, hash rate has continued to grow and currently stands at around 320 exahashes per second (EH/s), with the U.S. alone estimated to account for almost 37% of all ha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose back above $20,000 on Saturday, despite markets still being spooked by the collapse of yet another banking institution. Silicon Valley Bank was shut down by U.S. regulators on Friday, causing many institutions to lose access to capital. This includes USDC issuer Circle, which led to a USDC depegging. Ethereum also rebounded on Saturday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rose back above $20,000 on Saturday, despite overall volatility in financial markets being at historic highs.
 
This comes as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) confirmed it was shutting down Silicon Valley Bank.
 
Despite this, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $20,792.53, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $19,628.25.
 
 
Overall, today’s marginal rally in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) found a floor at the 27.00 level.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 28.46, with bitcoin at $20,279.45, as earlier gains have eased.
 
Market volatility will likely remain higher in the coming days, leading to bitcoin moving above and below $20,000 throughout the weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also significantly higher to start the weekend, as prices rose back above $1,400.
 
Following a two-month low at $1,378.53 yesterday, ETH/USD moved to a peak at the $1,481.32 level on Saturday.
 
The move comes as ethereum bulls bought yesterday’s dip, as price strength moved deep into oversold territory.
 
 
Friday saw ethereum’s RSI fall to 28.30, which was its weakest point since last June, however the index has since rallied.
 
As of writing, it is now tracking at 32.26, and appears to be heading towards a long-term floor at 34.00.
 
Should it reach this point, there is a strong possibility that ethereum will be back above $1,500.

Leading DeFi protocol BTC PROXY today expanded support for the Binance BNB Chain as well as updating support on Ethereum and Polygon for their ($BTCpx) Bitcoin Proxy. Minting and bridging of BTCpx to the three networks goes live on or after March 10th, 2023. This fulfilled a vision of allowing the Proxy community to utilize their Bitcoin for use in DeFi on Polygon, Ethereum and BNB Chains.
 
BTC Proxy’s expansion to the three networks allows the Minting of BTCpx token using BTC Bitcoin, WBTC ERC20 and Polygon as well as BTCB BEP20.
