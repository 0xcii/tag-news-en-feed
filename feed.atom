        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fallout from the collapse of major crypto exchange FTX continues, as the liquidator attempts to recover nearly $4 billion for creditors from another bankrupt crypto firm, Genesis Global Capital (GGC). 
 
According to Wired, the court in the Southern District of New York will decide on June 15 whether to allow FTX to pursue GGC over payments made shortly before the exchange’s collapse, amid allegations of fraud.
 
GGC filed for bankruptcy in January, after being caught in the blowback from FTX’s implosion. However, the firm only has about $5 billion in assets, meaning that if the court allows FTX to go ahead, a zero-sum legal battle will ensue. This will result in very low recoveries for Genesis creditors, according to Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of wealth management firm Lumida Wealth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was one of the biggest losers in crypto markets on Tuesday, as markets continued to react to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suing Binance and Coinbase. The global cryptocurrency market lost nearly 4% of its value in today’s session. Solana was another notable mover, falling by 9% today. 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) fell to a three-month low on Tuesday, as traders continued to react to news that the SEC had sued both  and Coinbase.
 
The Coinbase suit alleges that the exchange has been operating as an unregistered broker, whilst Binance has been accused of violating U.S. securities laws.
 
DOGE/USD dropped to a low of $0.06483 on the news, which is its weakest point since March 10.
 
 
The sell-off comes a day after the meme coin was trading at a peak of $0.07163, but it has gone on to drop by over 7%.
 
From a technical point of view, the decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) moved below a floor of 33.00
 
As of writing, the index is deep in oversold territory, and is currently tracking at 29.33.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
In addition to DOGE, solana (SOL) also fell big in today’s session, losing over 9% of its value.
 
After a high of $21.54 to start the week, SOL/USD slipped to an intraday low of $19.42 earlier today.
 
Following the plunge in price, solana fell to its lowest point since May 27, when it was last below $20.00.
 
 
Similar to dogecoin, today’s decline came as a result of a breakout which occurred on the RSI indicator.
 
Price Strength fell below a key point of support at 42.00, and is currently at a reading of 40.63.
 
In the event that bearish pressure intensifies, the next target could be a lower floor at $18.50.

Taxpayers are expected to report digital transactions from the start of 2023 under the Infrastructural Investment and Jobs Act. But the lawmakers stated that such regulations are not yet promulgated.
 
Lawmakers Believe Crypto Firms Are Responsible For Tax Gap
 
The Congressmen, Brad Sherman, and Stephen Lynch, wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel regarding tax compliance in the digital asset industry. They faulted crypto firms as the main source of the tax gap in the United States.
