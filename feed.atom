        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The BIS’ Basel Committee introduced a finalized proposal for limits to the amount of Tier 1 capital banks can hold in bitcoin.
The Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has finalized a proposed policy that would place a 2% limit on banks' Tier 1 capital held in bitcoin. This comes with an endorsement from the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the oversight body of the Basel Committee, which is the “primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks.”
Investopedia defines Tier 1 capital as “the core capital held in a bank's reserves [that] is used to fund business activities for the bank's clients. It includes common stock, as well as disclosed reserves and certain other assets.” 
The policy includes bitcoin in its definition of Group 2 crypto assets, saying that “In addition to any tokenised traditional assets and stablecoins that fail the classification conditions, Group 2 includes all unbacked cryptoassets.” It later describes that “a bank’s total exposure to Group 2 cryptoassets should not generally be higher than 1% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital and must not exceed 2% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital.”

The BIS had previously considered a policy of 1% for global banks. In turn, the banks requested a 5% reserve limit. This 2% appears to be a compromise between the two. According to data from 2020, if applied to all banks in the world, who collectively custody approximately $180 trillion, this would amount to a limit of $3.6 trillion in bitcoin held by such entities. 
Tiff Macklem, Chair of the GHOS, stated that “Today's endorsement by the GHOS marks an important milestone in developing a global regulatory baseline for mitigating risks to banks from cryptoassets. It is important to continue to monitor bank-related developments in cryptoasset markets. We remain ready to act further if necessary.”]]></summary>

A new development saw users of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange taking to Twitter to reveal that banks may be taking action against bank accounts linked to FTX.
 
Are Banks Closing FTX-Linked Bank Accounts?
 
The first signs of trouble came when the Head of Operations at Elixir Protocol, Cole Petersen took to Twitter to reveal that his bank had closed his accounts. Petersen attributes the closure to the FTX wire transfers that had been made on the accounts. The user who had been on FTX US, the US subsidiary of the Bahamas-based crypto exchange, further added a warning for o…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ada-hits-all-time-low-on-friday-matic-extends-recent-downtrend/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano fell to an all-time low on Friday, as sentiment in crypto markets remained bearish in today’s session. The token fell for a third consecutive day, with prices moving below a key price floor in the process. Polygon also extended recent declines, hitting a multi-week low as a result. 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) hit an all-time low in today’s session, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remains bearish, following recent economic data.
 
ADA/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.2845 earlier in today’s session, less than a day after trading at $0.3026.
 
Today’s sell-off comes as cardano fell for a third straight session, breaking out of a key support point in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the aforementioned floor is at the $0.3000 mark, which was broken once before, on November 21.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also moved below a floor of 35.50, and as of writing is tracking at 30.91.
 
This is the lowest point the index has hit since October 22, with prices hitting a bottom of $0.3100 on that occasion.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was another notable token to fall today, with prices also moving lower for a third straight day.
 
Following a high of $0.891 on Thursday, MATIC/USD dropped to a bottom of $0.8483 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this drop, polygon moved to its lowest point since November 30, when prices hit a bottom of $0.837
 
 
MATIC has since rebounded from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $0.8569, which is still nearly 4% lower than Thursday’s floor.
 
This slight rebound comes as the RSI rejected a breakout of a point of support at the 43.00 level, and the index is currently at the 44.26 mark.
 
Historically, bulls have used this floor as a point of reentry, and should this reoccur, then we could see MATIC move back towards the $0.90 level.
