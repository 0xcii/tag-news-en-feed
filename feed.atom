Shiba Inu Has Seen A TD Sequential Buy Signal Recently
 
As explained by analyst Ali in a new post on X, the SHIB weekly chart has observed a buy signal recently. The “TD (Tom Demark) Sequential” is a tool in technical analysis that’s used to time reversals in the price of an asset.
 
There are two phases of the indicator: a 9 candle setup phase and a 13 candle countdown phase. The former of these starts when the price observes a flip and continues until the ninth candle is hit. At that point, the price hits a bottom or a top (depending on the surrounding price trend).

Prices rose by as much as 9% today, taking the total gain to 50% over the last seven days. Solana was another notable gainer, surging over the $33.00 mark.
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) was a notable gainer on Wednesday, as the token rose to a by as much as 9% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $9.84 on Tuesday, LINK/USD rallied to an intraday peak at $11.55 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, the cryptocurrency climbed to its strongest point since last year, when price peaked over $12.00.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the latest surge in price has kept the relative strength index (RSI) above the 80.00 level.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 81.87, which is its highest point since August 2020, which is deep in overbought territory.
 
LINK is trading at $11.13, as of writing.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) also rallied higher in today’s session, after climbing above the $33.00 level earlier in the day.
 
SOL/USD climbed to a high at the $33.69 on Wednesday, which comes a day after falling to a low of $29.70.
 
Today’s surge in price pushed solana to its highest level since last November, and comes after a breakout on the RSI.
 
 
Price strength broke out of a ceiling at the 73.00 mark, with the index now tracking at a reading of 77.05.
 
This is a marginal decline from a high of 82.00 earlier this week, which was also a key point of resistance.
 
In order to move towards a possible target at $35.00, bulls will need to force a surge past the aforementioned 82.00 point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ex-FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried is slated to make his case directly to the jury in his ongoing trial, as shared by his defense lawyer, Mark Cohen. Bankman-Fried’s decision to testify comes on the heels of several witnesses who have spoken against him in recent weeks.
 
Facing Accusations: Sam Bankman-Fried Prepares to Plead His Case Directly to Jury
 
Having already shared his side of the story with outlets like The New York Times and Good Morning America, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is gearing up to assert his innocence to a panel comprising 12 jurors and six alternate jurors.
 
Defense counsel Mark Cohen announced that SBF will take the witness stand, in a press statement conducted via teleconference on Wednesday. This development has been widely reported, with Matthew Russell Lee of Inner City Press providing insights. Russell Lee has confirmed that he will be broadcasting a live stream of SBF’s testimony through social media platform X.
 
SBF has sat through testimonies from past colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh. He has also heard from FTX’s former general counsel and the CEO of Blockfi, all of whom have testified against him.
 
 
Despite these challenges, the ex-FTX CEO maintains his innocence, pleading not guilty to all charges, even as he stares down a potential sentence of over 100 years in prison. His testimony is scheduled for Thursday, October 26, 2023, and Cohen has hinted that it will be a comprehensive examination likely to take all day.
 
SBF won’t be the only one speaking in his defense; Joseph Pimbley of PF2 Securities is also set to testify on his behalf. The latest development follows strategic moves by both the U.S. government and SBF’s defense team as they submitted their juror preferences and requests in anticipation of the trial’s outcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto exchange Binance briefly halted withdrawals on its platform after experiencing a technical issue. The company launched an investigation, and an hour later, withdrawal resumed on the platform.
 
 
 
Binance Experiences Technical Issues
 
According to a post on social media platform X, withdrawals were paused due to an issue with the middleware service running on the platform. While crypto withdrawals were halted, users had access to fiat withdrawals.
 
Following an investigation that failed to provide details about the specifics of the issue, the crypto exchange restored the service. The company stated:
 

The issue is now fixed, and all crypto withdrawals on Binance are now back to functioning as usual. Thanks for your patience, and we apologize for the inconvenience.
 
In the crypto community, some took to X to promote their platforms over the centralized exchange. In particular, the team behind decentralized exchange (DEX) THORChain took the opportunity to remind users about their alleged advantages over Binance:
 

All cross-chain services deal with many, many issues and have to pause to deal with edge cases. The difference with TC is that you can jump in and see exactly what’s wrong at any time and don’t need a spokesperson so say “funds are safe” – because you can check it yourself.
 
Binance has experienced several obstacles lately, from the increasing regulatory oversight in major jurisdictions, such as the US and Europe, and key members leaving their positions. In addition, the exchanges are currently fighting many legal battles while their trading volumes crashed in some regions.
 
 
Still, the crypto company claims to be committed to continue offering its services to its millions of users. On the latest issue, the exchange’s CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, stated:
 

Technical issue with a middleware service impacting withdrawals. Funds are SAFU. Our team is on it.

 Back in 2013, we had very early, tech-savvy adopters picking up on what was envisioned as a new currency. In 2017, retail traders became caught up in the exuberance, and there was a sense that Bitcoin might be a kind of digital gold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin profit takers swooped in to capture recent profits on Wednesday, as the cryptocurrency retreated below a recent high above $35,000. The decline comes ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech later today. Ethereum also edged lower, dropping under the $1,800 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was trading lower on Wednesday, as traders appeared to have finally decided to secure profits, following recent gains.
 
BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $33,278.40 late in yesterday’s session, after an earlier peak above the $35,000 mark.
 
Although bulls have since pushed the cryptocurrency higher, with the price now at $34,246.74, it remains below heights seen on Tuesday.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
One reason for this being the relative strength index (RSI), which was significantly overbought on Tuesday, tracking around 89.00.
 
Currently, the index is at a reading of 87.22, which is marginally lower, but still remains primed for a reversal.
 
Today’s speech could be the storm that traders are waiting to clear, before either intensifying recent momentum, or selling off further.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) retreated below the $1,800 level on Wednesday, snapping a six-day winning streak.
 
Following a high of $1,852.68 during yesterday’s session, ETH/USD fell to a low of $1,758.69 earlier in the day.
 
ETH has since rebounded, marginally, and is now trading at $1,784.57, which is over 3% lower than Tuesday’s peak.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Overall sentiment remains largely positive, with the 10-day (red) moving average extending its upward trend versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Although the RSI in ethereum is also overbought, and tracking above 70.00, bulls could attempt to push the price above $1,900 in this upcycle.
