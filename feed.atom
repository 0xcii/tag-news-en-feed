The Case Against The Crypto Influencer
 
In 2022, influencer and Token Metrics CEO Ian Balina was accused of violating securities laws. The SEC charged Balina for his involvement in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of an unregistered security.
 
According to the court documents, Software development company Sparkster Ltd conducted an unregistered securities offering with the Sparkster (SPRK) token between April and July 2018. The ICO raised around $30 million from 4,000 US-based and international investors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin, like the rest of the crypto market, has seen a slow down over the last day that has greatly impacted its price. However, this slowdown isn’t completely limited to the price as the open interest-weighted funding rate of the meme con has seen a significant decline over the last day.
 
Dogecoin OI-Weighted Funding Rate Crashes 50%
 
Over the last few days, as the Dogecoin price rose, so did the OI-weighted funding rate. This is normal, given that the funding rate follows market sentiment. In times when crypto traders are very bullish, the funding rate rises as long traders have to pay short traders to keep their positions open. Then, when sentiment is skewed toward bearishness, funding rates tend to drop, and short traders pay long traders to keep their positions open.
