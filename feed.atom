to move to court to challenge the ruling that granted Ripple Labs a partial win  
against the agency. The SEC has reportedly written to a judge in Manhattan to  
allow the federal court of appeal to examine the ruling, which was made in July.
On July 13, US District

public exchange did not amount to a violation of the securities regulations.  
The decision was against the SEC’s argument that the blockchain payments platform

With traditional markets and central banks closely monitoring the inflation metrics, the ripple effects on the digital asset market could be profound.
 
Wall Street is bracing for the July CPI data, with expectations that both the headline and core indices will rise by 0.2% from June. This would adjust the 12-month core CPI to 4.7% from June’s 4.8%, while the headline index (YoY) is predicted to ascend to 3.3% from June’s 3.0%.
