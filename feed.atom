While it is coasting along at $0.966 per unit at the time of writing, five days ago it tapped an all-time low at $0.917 per coin. Aave’s Liquidity Committee aims to mitigate the issue with a plan to address the problem with static pools and manage liquidity.
 
Aave’s GHO Stablecoin Wobbles: Liquidity Committee Scrambles to Restore Dollar Parity
 
Aave’s GHO stablecoin, linked to the defi protocol, has been trading below its $1 peg since July, with a current value of around $0.96. The price deviation is attributed to an imbalance between demand and supply, compounded by interest rates that do not adapt to the market, set lower than alternatives like DAI or USD…]]></summary>

Renowned as a Bitcoin advocate, Saylor reaffirmed his belief in the unparalleled potential for Bitcoin, foreseeing a tenfold upsurge in its value.
 
This week, Bitcoin hovered near the $36,000 mark, narrowly missing it before tumbling back to $34,300. The abrupt correction followed a nearly 25% climb in the last month, prompting some traders to seize profits and market participants to re-evaluate the driving forces behind the rally.

According to the COO, this mismatch stems from the fact manufacturers cannot build new supplies quickly enough to match the growth in demand.
 
Mismatch Between Demand for GPUs and Their Supply
 
To highlight the extent of the problem, Green points to compute requirements for machine learning (ML) training which have grown 10x every 18 months since 2010. In contrast, computing power is believed to have grown 2x during the period and the primary reason for this is the “long lead time to build new supply.”

According to a recent post, Havel’s journey began with delving into “PlayStation jailbreaking,” where he discovered vulnerabilities in older PlayStation 4 firmware that allowed for control takeover. 
 
Jailbreaking refers to bypassing the restrictions imposed by the official software (firmware) of a device, in this case, a PlayStation 4 console. 
 
By jailbreaking the console, the researcher, Mario Havel, gained unauthorized access to the system, allowing him to run custom software and applications and make modifications not typically allowed by the manufacturer.
