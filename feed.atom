A crypto investor recently made a $23.5 million from investing the SHIB token over the last two months. Here’s how they did it.
 
Shiba Inu Investor Makes Bank
 
On-chain analytics platform Spot On Chain revealed that a particular trader had been making massive moves in the market over the last few months. The trader had begun buying large chunks of SHIB tokens back in January when the price was still trending below $0.00001. In total, the whale trader was able to accumulate around 1.24 trillion SHIB for $11.66 million at the time.

This latest release is now available for immediate testing and seamless integration.
Some key highlights of SRI 1.0.0 include:

Miners can connect to SV2 pools without upgrading existing SV1 firmware through Translation Proxy or directly using an SV2 firmware device like BraiinsOS.
Miners have the flexibility to run their bitcoin nodes, construct templates, and declare them to the SV2 Pool.
The implementation of pool fallback functionality ensures continuity in mining activities even if a pool decides to censor transactions, thereby incentivizing pools to prioritize miners' interests.

Bitcoin Adjusted SOPR Retested The 1.0 Level Prior To Recovery
 
When Bitcoin was declining, the cryptocurrency had dropped to a low of $60,600, which appears to have been the bottom, at least so far, given that the coin has rebounded sharply since hitting the mark.
 
Around the time of BTC’s recent low prices, an analyst had pointed out in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post that the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) had plunged to a value of 1 alongside the asset’s drop.
 
 
The aSOPR is an on-chain indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors realize a net profit or loss with their current selling.

Trend Rider suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) post that ADA could rise to as high as $12 as ADA’s market shifts from a bearish to a bullish sentiment. His analysis focused on ADA’s 2-week chart, which showed that key moving averages are realigning, the analyst claimed.
