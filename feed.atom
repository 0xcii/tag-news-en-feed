        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MARA (NASDAQ: MARA), a leader in leveraging digital asset compute for energy transformation, has purchased $100 million worth of Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to over 20,000 BTC, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.
The company also announced a new treasury policy to adopt a full HODL approach, retaining all Bitcoin mined and making periodic strategic purchases.
"Adopting a full HODL strategy reflects our confidence in the long-term value of bitcoin," stated Fred Thiel, MARA’s chairman and CEO. "We believe bitcoin is the world’s best treasury reserve asset and support the idea of sovereign wealth funds holding it. We encourage governments and corporations to all hold bitcoin as a reserve asset.”   
MARA said it aims to leverage its technological expertise to support Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem.
“Prior to last year, the company used to hold all of its bitcoin,” said Salman Khan, MARA’s chief financial officer in the press release. “Given Bitcoin’s current tailwinds, including increased institutional support and an improving macro environment, we are once again implementing this strategy and focusing on growing the amount we hold on our balance sheet. Bitcoin’s recent price decline, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet, afforded us an opportunity to add to our holdings. We look forward to continuing to leverage our technological expertise to support Bitcoin and distributed digital asset ecosystems.”  
Just last month, MARA announced that it was using the heat generated from its Bitcoin mining to heat a town of 11,000 in Finland.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ego Death Capital, a venture capital fund focused on investing in Bitcoin technology startups, has announced the successful first close of its $100 million second fund.  
The fund has already secured $43.35 million in commitments from investors, underscoring strong interest in backing the next wave of Bitcoin companies. Ego Death has previously backed leading startups like Relai, Breez, Fedi, LN Markets, and more.
Founded by Jeff Booth, Andi Pitt, and Nico Lechuga, Ego Death Capital targets Series A investments in rapidly scaling Bitcoin startups with this fund. Preston Pysh and Lyn Alden have also recently joined them as a General Partner in the second fund. 
The successful first close demonstrates the surging appetite among investors to allocate capital to the expanding Bitcoin technology sector. 
According to Ego Death founding partner Nico Lechuga, "While there are a number of Bitcoin-only VC funds investing at the Seed stage, there was no Series A-focused fund to support the rapidly developing ecosystem."
Jeff Booth commented, "There are almost no words to describe the feeling of having a front seat in the creation of value on a protocol that brings truth, hope, and abundance to 8 billion people."
The ability of prominent venture funds to raise sizable funds focused purely on Bitcoin startups signals the maturity and growth of the broader ecosystem. More access to late-stage capital will accelerate the development and usage of Bitcoin technology.]]></summary>
