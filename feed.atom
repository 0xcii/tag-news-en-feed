        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. [Singapore, September 4th 2023] – The Hourglass Collective is spearheading a new era of Web3 adoption. In a world where technological progress has sprinted from hard industries to consumer-facing revolutions, it’s now in the hands of service-oriented high-tech sectors like robotics, advanced software, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing.
 
OpenAI’s ChatGPT recently made headlines, reaching 100 million users in just two months, even outpacing TikTok’s adoption rate record of nine months. Yet, challenges faced by crypto, Web3, and blockchain technologies in 2022 prompted the need for fresh perspectives and strategies to clarify and elevate their value proposition to the real economy.
 
The solution? The Hourglass Collective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin and crypto market is starting into a very quiet week today in terms of upcoming events. Both crypto related events as well as notable macro data are very scarce this week. The most important macro data are the ISM Services PMI (on Wednesday 10:00 am EST) and the initial jobless claims (on Thursday at 8:30 am EST). However, neither event is likely to have a significant impact on the dollar index (DXY) and thus Bitcoin and crypto.
 
Due to this, we are making an exception this Monday and looking at the entire month of September rather than the upcoming seven days in our weekly preview. September holds several extremely important events in store, and could also provide a few surprises.

Ripple And Its Executives Object To Appeal
 
According to the court filing dated September 1, Ripple stated that the SEC doesn’t have the right to an appeal as the “exceptional circumstances” required for it are absent. 
 
The SEC had earlier argued that an appeal was necessary because it involved controlling questions of law. The regulator also cited how Judge Torres’ ruling could affect its case against Terraform, Coinbase, and Binance.
