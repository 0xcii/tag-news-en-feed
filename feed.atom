XRP (XRP)
 
One thing about XRP is that the coin was unable to enjoy the last bull market like the rest of the cryptocurrencies in the space. This is due to the fact that the Exchange and Securities Commission still has an active case against Ripple.
 
When the lawsuit was first revealed in 2020, the price of XRP lost over 40% of its value and has been unable to recover since then. It is the only cryptocurrency out of the large caps that was unable to hit a new al…]]></summary>
