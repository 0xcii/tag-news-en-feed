Available ETH On Exchanges Fall To Genesis Levels
 
When the Ethereum network was first launched back in 2015, the available ETH on exchanges was very low due to it being a new player. The exchange balances would steadily rise over the next few years as the digital asset gained widespread acceptance and began trading on countless exchanges.

        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e74a8b7c156</id>
        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitmain-unveils-new-t21-bitcoin-miner-offers-btc-fluctuation-protection-plan/"/>
        <updated>2023-10-25T21:51:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, the bitcoin mining rig manufacturer Bitmain announced the introduction of a new air-cooled BTC miner, the T21 Antminer. The new device boasts a production capacity of up to 190 terahash per second (TH/s) and maintains an efficiency ratio of approximately 19 joules per terahash (J/T).
 
Bitmain Debuts T21 Antminer
 
After the recent unveiling of Microbt’s latest mining equipment, Bitmain, a competitor, has added the T21 Antminer to its extensive range of hashing devices. On October 25, Bitmain showcased the T21, capable of delivering 190 TH/s with an efficiency rating of 19 J/T.
 
Additionally, the company introduced an optional bitcoin price fluctuation plan, ensuring customers receive compensation if BTC’s prices fall below the strike on a reference day within a protected period.
 

 
The bitcoin fluctuation protection plan offers various tiers, depending on the duration of the protected period, with Bitmain asserting that “compensation shall be paid immediately upon the triggering event.”
 
The T21 Antminer is the latest in a series of launches by Bitmain, following two new devices from the S21 series introduced last month. The S21 Hyd achieves up to 335 TH/s with an efficiency rating of 16 J/T, while the air-cooled S21 miner provides up to 200 TH/s with an efficiency rating of about 17.5 J/T.
 
 
While the S21 air-cooled machine offers slightly superior ratings compared to the T21, the latter, however, surpasses the S19 Antminers in efficiency ratios. The specifications for the T21 detail a power consumption of 3,610 watts, with expected shipping in the first quarter of 2024.
 
The T21 is also comparable to the S21 air-cooled Antminer in terms of size and weight. This year has seen the release of several new devices by all three major bitcoin mining machine manufacturers: Bitmain with three, Canaan with two, and Microbt with three.

According to local news media South China Morning Post, citing sources familiar with the matter, Binance might be the force behind HKVAEX, a newly minted crypto trading platform in Hong Kong. 
 
 
HKVAEX: A New Contender Or A Strategic Move?
 
Established in December 2022, HKVAEX commenced its trading operations two months later, in February. While the platform presents itself as an independent entity operating under the umbrella of BX Services Limited, the report citing three industry insiders points towards shared resources with Binance.

Throughout the year, whispers of FTX’s potential revival have surfaced approximately four times. During his first interview post-FTX collapse in January 2023, FTX’s restructuring head, CEO John J. Ray III, hinted at a resurgence. In a subsequent April hearing, the topic resurfaced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin has risen over 110% in 2023 at the time of writing, where the price of the asset started the year off at $16,677 on January 1, has now pumped to above $35,000 only 10 months later. With more room to run this year as hype builds in the market around the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC and the upcoming halving event, many are now questioning if this is the end of this cycle's eventful bear market.
Since the few disastrous incidents that happened in the bear market causing the price drop, things are now looking more optimistic. As some of the worlds largest asset managers, including Fidelity, VanEck and WisdomTree, have filed in hopes to be the first in the United States to get approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. One name in particular though is making more headlines than the rest, and that is the worlds largest asset manger BlackRock, who manages about $10 trillion.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently made an appearance on Fox Business stating that their clients around the world are interested in getting exposure to Bitcoin, saying the recent price rally has been a "flight to quality." Earlier this month, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their approval odds for a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC to 90% by January 10, 2024.



The next Bitcoin having is expected to take place in roughly 180 days in late April, 2024. The event will see the Bitcoin block reward drop from 6.25 BTC per block to only 3.125 BTC. This will be the fourth halving in Bitcoin's history, with the first happening in November 2012, the second happened in July 2016, and the third happened in May 2020. Historically, a year leading up to and after the halving, the price of BTC goes up substantially.]]></summary>

Back’s comment arrives during a period of significant market turbulence triggered by the abrupt removal of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust from the listing of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, sending ripples through the crypto community.
