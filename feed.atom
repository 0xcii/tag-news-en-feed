        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, following the market’s closure, major U.S. indices concluded the day unchanged, coming off a rise the previous day. This surge was influenced by the dovish remarks made on Tuesday by Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller. Observers of the market infer that Waller’s comments indicate a potential shift in the stance of the U.S. central bank, a notable deviation given his usually hawkish perspective. Concurrently, the Federal Reserve’s latest ‘Beige Book’ report presented a more troubling outlook than its predecessor, pointing to decelerated economic expansion and a rise in consumer credit defaults.

In a shocking development to the international Bitcoin community, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao is stepping down from his role as part of a guilty plea on criminal and civil charges in the US. 
Binance, the largest digital asset exchange in the world by volume, has seen its very future come into question as the result of a legal battle with the US Department of Justice (DoJ).

DOGE Founder Slams DAOs
 
In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Dogecoin creator, Billy Marcus aka Shibetoshi Nakamoto openly criticized Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), expressing a general dislike for the organization and the idea behind it. 
 
“DAOs are almost universally stupid and doomed because ‘crypto communities’ are often exclusively interested in short-term profits, the hype is worth more than actual deliveries, and nobody has any incentive to build anything,” Marcus stated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AntPool, a prominent Bitcoin mining pool, has made headlines by agreeing to refund an unusually high transaction fee of $3 million.
 
This decision follows the accidental payment of this fee by a Bitcoin user, setting a new record for a single transaction fee in US dollar terms.
 
A Bitcoin Anomaly And AntPool’s Response
 
The incident unfolded last week when a Bitcoin transaction included a fee of 83.65 BTC, equivalent to roughly $3.1 million, to transfer 55.77 BTC worth around $2.1 million. This extraordinary fee, amounting to over 120,528 times the usual rate, was initially frozen by AntPool’s risk control system.
 
 
The transaction, which drastically reduced the sender’s balance before the transaction of 139.42 BTC worth $5.2 million, was processed in block 818,087 mined by AntPool. U…]]></summary>

The move, which takes effect on December 15, 2023, is a result of regulatory pressure that Paxos, the BUSD issuer, had to deal with.

U.S. Treasury has boldly extended its reach, seeking  
expanded powers that transcend national borders. Deputy Secretary of the  
Treasury Wally Adeyemo's impassioned plea to Congress for extraterritorial

to the ongoing domestic regulatory conundrum.
As Adeyemo presents a set of common-sense  
recommendations, it underscores the inherent challenges faced by the U.S. in

Bitcoin had nearly two years of low transaction fees from the lack of demand to actually send Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin is considered to be the most secure blockchain in the world, but that security depends on miners who receive their revenue from transaction fees and block rewards. As part of the predetermined supply schedule, the block rewards are expected to be halved around April 2024 which would further drastically cut the miner revenue. To support the miners, Bitcoin needed something new to spur growth, and that was Ordinals. Ordinals drove huge demand to send Bitcoin transactions.

He noted that the moment he began to have this belief was when he realized that Ripple was selling into the market on a monthly basis.

The approval, dated November 29 and issued by a

significant step in repaying creditors impacted by the collapse of the
