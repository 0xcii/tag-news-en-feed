Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Show Miner Capitulation Is Ongoing
 
In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed the relevance of the Bitcoin hashrate to the asset’s price recovery. The “hashrate” refers to a measure of the total computing power the miners have currently connected to the network.
 
The trend in this metric can be viewed as a representation of the situation among these chain validators. When the indicator rises, it suggests that miners are finding the chain attractive to mine on right now.
 
 
On the other hand, a decline in the metric implies some miners have decided to disconnect from the network, potentially because they are currently find…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-1166/"/>
        <updated>2024-06-22T03:01:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a positive turn of events, the Shiba Inu burn rate has seen another notable spike. This time around, the activity, meaning the number of addresses participating in the burns, has seen a notable increase and the burned tokens have risen by over 1,100% in one day.
 
Shiba Inu 1,166% Spike In Burn Rate
 
According to Shibburn, the official website for tracking the total amount of SHIB tokens burned each day, the Shiba Inu burn rate has seen a 1,166% spike. This spike is significant as it shows an increased willingness among Shiba Inu investors to burn tokens.
 
 
In the 24-hour period, a total of 35.29 million tokens have been burned, which is a marked difference from the previous day’s figures. However, what might be more important is the number of burn transactions that have been recorded in the 24-hour timeframe.
 
Shibburn’s data shows that there has been a total of 12 burn transactions from holders in the last day. This is a welcome change from the average of six burn transactions that have been recorded over this week. Notable burns have also been recorded across a number of transactions instead of concentrated to just one or two transactions only.
 
For example, the highest burn transaction during this time was a wallet which sent a little over 10 million tokens to the burn address. Then there are seven transactions carrying between 2 million and 5.5 million tokens to the address. While the rest of the transactions were carrying much lower volumes.
 
This spike in the burn rate follows a positive trend that began this week. On June 18, Bitcoinist reported that the Shiba Inu burn rate had seen a 5,569% spike. This comes after a notable stretch of time with muted burn performances, making this a positive turn in the tide.
 
 
Elsewhere, more specifically, the daily trading volume, Shiba Inu is performing poorly compared to its burn rate. The daily volume is down 14.22% and sitting at $270 million. In the same vein, the price is seeing daily losses of 0.71% and down 15.17% in the last week.]]></summary>
