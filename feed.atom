After losing $95 million in a now-defunct crypto exchange, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan is no longer bullish on cryptocurrency investments. Several prominent funds invested in FTX between 2021 and 2022, just before the exchange’s eventual demise.
 
 
Pension Plan No Longer Bullish On Crypto
 
According to chief executive Jo Taylor, the $190 billion Canadian pension fund is “still working through what exactly happened there and you’re going to be careful.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin and crypto market have been experiencing a stronger correction since last Wednesday, rattling the bullish sentiment of the past few weeks. While the 1-week chart of Bitcoin still looks very bullish as long as the price stays above $25,000, the market is near the critical area in the 1-day chart.
 
Any divergence below $26,800 could mean a trend change on a daily basis. On the upside, the $27,800 area is of key importance. If this level is breached, the uptrend could resume sooner than expected by the bears. In the week ahead, several events and data are in place that could determine a trend direction.

The Taproot upgrade significantly improved the efficiency, scalability, and privacy of the Bitcoin network and allowed for more sophisticated smart contracts and transactions to be created. 
However, this upgrade didn't really take off until this year when a project called Ordinals introduced a new use case to the Bitcoin network — NFTs.
Bitcoin Ordinals: The Idea and the Base
NFTs saw an explosion in popularity in 2020, but they were mostly minted and traded on the Ethereum blockchain. With the release of Ordinals from ex-Bitcoin Core collaborator, Casey Rodarmor, NFTs are finally appearing on Bitcoin.

In India, crypto assets still remain unregulated, and the government does not register crypto exchanges. Sitharaman explained that since digital assets are borderless and require international collaboration, any regulation on them would require the consent of every nation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
