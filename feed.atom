Well-respected on-chain analyst Willy Woo remarked via Twitter that the BTC network is on track to become carbon negative, with 6% of miner CO2 already being offset by methane capture mining.
 
According to Woo, the transformation is poised to take a significant leap, as enterprises like CH4 Capital, led by ESG analyst Daniel Batten, take a front-row seat in this green revolution. Batten’s firm intends to inject $50 million into methane capture mining over the next year, potentially increasing the mitigation figure to 17%.
