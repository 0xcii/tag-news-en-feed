        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new miners will contribute to CleanSpark’s ongoing expansion, just as the Bitcoin market ramps up.
CleanSpark Inc. has purchased 20,000 brand new Antminer S19j Pro+ units, the latest generation of Bitmain’s bitcoin mining machines, for $43.6 million. After coupons, the company will pay $32.3 million, according to the press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.
This purchase is expected to expand the company's bitcoin production capacity by 37%, adding 2.44 exahashes per second (EH/s) once installed. CleanSpark plans to deploy the fleet of new machines at its wholly-owned bitcoin mining locations in the USA with 15,000 of them planned for its Washington, Georgia, facility. There may be changes to that allocation, depending on the state of development of the site and the pace of order fulfillment by the manufacturer, the release states.
Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, said, "Building and owning our mining campuses at multiple locations provides us with a level of agility and reliability that cannot be achieved otherwise. As machines are delivered to us, we will have rackspace waiting for them at one of our sites. This is the advantage of proprietary mining or the 'prop mining' model. We exercise tremendous control over our infrastructure and, therefore, our ability to be highly efficient in the way we allocate our resources."
CleanSpark's capital management strategy includes selling a major portion of its mined bitcoins to reinvest in growth, manifesting in the form of these expansions. The Pro+ is more power-efficient and 22% more productive than the popular Antminer S19j Pro model and will be shipped in batches, with deliveries starting as early as next month. All batches are expected to be delivered to the company's mining campuses by the end of May 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sure, Ethereum is still the NFT market share leader, but there’s an ever-present ‘multi-chain future’ discussion among the NFT space. NFT marketplace leader OpenSea has exhibited open arms to this concept, adding support for chains like Polygon and Avalanche.
 
It doesn’t just stop and start with OpenSea, either: the once Solana-dedicated NFT marketplace Magic Eden has been branching out, including support for Polygon NFTs. While not cross-chain (at least, yet), Ethereum-dedicated no-fee platform Blur has launched it’s own Ethereum-based platform token, causing quite a stir this week.
 
And now Rarible, another major longtime NFT marketplace, is expanding to a more multi-chain future as well – announcing new tools of support for Tezos and Polygon NFTs this week.

Impact Of Inscriptions On The Bitcoin Blocksize
 
Very recently, “Inscriptions” have emerged on the Bitcoin network, basically an application of the BTC blockchain similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), but not the same.
 
Unlike NFTs on other blockchains like Ethereum, these Inscriptions are directly inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain (hence the name). Inscriptions can be data, images, audio, video, or even software.
 
Since they are directly stored as a transaction on the blockchain, they have been quickly inflating the size of the chain. This has made these assets a hotly debated topic around the community regarding their impact on the future of the crypto…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is now up to the governor of Wyoming to put the final stamp of approval on the landmark bill.
The U.S. state of Wyoming has passed a bill that protects its citizens from having to disclose their private keys, with a singular exception. Having now been approved by the state Senate and House of Representatives, it now simply needs to be signed by the Governor in order to take effect.
The bill states that, “No person shall be compelled to produce a private key or make a private key known to any other person in any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative or other proceeding in this state that relates to a digital asset, digital identity or other interest or right to which the private key provides access unless a public key is unavailable or unable to disclose the requisite information with respect to the digital asset, digital identity or other interest or right.” 
It does not specify that it would be only for Bitcoin keys, so it would also apply the same to private keys utilized as decentralized identities, or any other use cases. Wyoming has been the center of attention in regards to Bitcoin adoption in the U.S. for some time, partially because of Senator Cynthia Lummis’ ardent support of Bitcoin and push for regulation within the country. 
Christopher Allen, internet cryptography pioneer and executive director of Blockchain Commons who previously wrote for Bitcoin Magazine in regards to the importance of protecting private key sovereignty, described why Wyoming has been a groundbreaking state for this type of legislature.
 “[Wyoming] has a long tradition of ‘good fences make for good neighbors’... and as a small state it has a true ‘citizen’ legislature.… they resonate well with the concept of "Self-Sovereignty" in bitcoin and digital identity,” Allen told Bitcoin Magazine.
If approved by the governor, the bill would take effect on July 1, 2023.]]></summary>
