Some fear a spot bitcoin ETF could make BTC vulnerable, much like the gold and silver markets. The approval might open doors to manipulative practices reminiscent of those alleged in precious metals.
 
With a Physically-Settled Bitcoin ETF on the Horizon, Skeptics Foresee Gold-Like Manipulation Risks
 
A tangible bitcoin ETF might seem like a boon for crypto growth and valuation. However, there are concerns it could mirror gold and silver ETFs, using fictional BTC supplies as leverage for futures. Rapid price hikes could be countered by releasing this made-up supply. Instead of acquiring real bitcoin, buying into a bitcoin ETF would…]]></summary>

XRP Has Enjoyed A Sharp Rally During The Last 24 Hours
 
In the past day, the cryptocurrency sector as a whole has seen an uplift, led by Bitcoin’s approach to the $30,000 level. XRP has been no exception, as the token has enjoyed returns of 8% during this period, which are in fact more than what BTC itself has managed so far.
 
The below chart shows what XRP’s performance in the past few days has looked like:
 

 
 
At the peak of this sharp rally, XRP had broken above the 0.53 mark, but it has since then declined below the $0.52 level. Even with this pullback, though, the cryptocurrency’s surge remains impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was a big gainer on Friday, as markets reacted to the SEC’s decision to drop its lawsuit against Ripple’s management team. The commission previously alleged that CEO Brad Garlinghouse and chairman Chris Larsen had violated securities laws. Solana also surged, rising by over 10% today.
 
XRP
 
XRP rose to a two-week high on Friday, following a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to drop its case against Garlinghouse and Larsen.
 
XRP/USD peaked at $0.5291 earlier in the day, which comes following a low at $0.4831 the day prior.
 
As a result of today’s high, ripple rose to its highest point since October 5, when price peaked at $0.5325.
 
 
Earlier gains have now eased, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to move beyond a ceiling at 57.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 56.32, with the next visible floor at the 50.00 level.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average has also begun to trend upwards, increasing chances of an upwards crossover in the upcoming days.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) surged significantly higher in today’s session, after finally breaking its long-term ceiling at $25.00.
 
After trading at a bottom of $24.17 on Thursday, SOL/USD jumped to an intraday high of $27.29 earlier today.
 
Friday’s move is the highest point that solana has hit since July 20, when price peaked at $27.35.
 
 
As a result of this strong sentiment, SOL has risen into overbought territory, with the RSI climbing to a current reading of 74.60.
 
A point of resistance now awaits current bulls at the 75.00 mark, and should they prevail, solana could capture $28.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the advent of software development kits like BDK and LDK, building a bitcoin wallet has never been easier. However, as much as easier development is necessary, it's important to build in a way that protects user security and privacy by default. For example, how a light wallet connects to a third-party server to receive and send transaction data is an important issue to address.
I believe that bitcoin wallets need block filters to respect a user's privacy. Why? It's the only way to keep data from leaking to the server, which would allow it to link a user's transaction data beyond what is publicly available. 
In this article, we will explore why bitcoin wallets need block filters by first looking at how many bitcoin users run full nodes, how API wallets offer good user experience but ul…]]></summary>
