This unexpected steadiness triggered a sharp reaction in the crypto world, with Bitcoin’s price plummeting from $70,000 to $66,000 and Ethereum experiencing a similar downturn. The FOMC’s reluctance to cut rates, despite previous indications of multiple reductions, has amplified volatility, leading to nearly $400 million in liquidations and shaking investor confidence across the board.
 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that while there has been “considerable progress” in tackling inflation, the centra…]]></summary>
