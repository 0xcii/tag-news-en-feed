One such opportunity that has been catching the eye of investors, including a prominent Ethereum millionaire worth $21.7 million, is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a casino-focused meme coin that has seen an impressive 150% rally during its presale stages.
 
Ethereum’s Long-Standing Dominance

Ethereum has already plummeted nearly 40% from its 2024 high recorded in March, and Cowen’s analysis suggests there could be more downside ahead for ETH holders. As this uncertainty looms over Ethereum’s future, investors are increasingly turning to promising alternatives like the meme coin Mpeppe (MPEPE), which has seen strong growth and is now gearing up for Tier-1 exchange listings.

When the dollar weakens, Bitcoin often gains strength, and this dynamic might now be setting the stage for restarting the BTC bull cycle.
DXY
The Dollar Strength Index (DXY) measures the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of other major global currencies. Historically, a declining DXY has often coincided with significant rallies in Bitcoin's price.
