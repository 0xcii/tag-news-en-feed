The European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee has voted on the matter that will put these restrictions in place.
 
This measure was taken to limit the number of unbacked loans with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) that lenders could hold in front of the European Commission. Cross-party compromises will require banks to hold more capital to protect customers against crypto losses.
 
 
The legislation will bring the other outstanding components of the Basel III International Regulatory Framework into effect. Basel III is an internationally agreed set of measures developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banks would be allowed to hold 2% of capital in bitcoin, but required to have one euro in capital for every euro in cryptocurrency held.
European Union lawmakers have voted to impose strict capital requirements on banks that hold cryptocurrencies, per a Reuters article.
In an effort to “prevent instability in the crypto world from spilling over into the financial system,” Markus Ferber, economic spokesperson for the EU parliament's European People’s Party, says, “banks will be required to hold a euro of own capital for every euro they hold in crypto.” 
Lawmakers cite the chaos in the markets seen over the last few months as further evidence that such regulation is necessary. With events like the collapse of FTX, Celsius and others fresh in the minds of users, the passing of this law is anticipated to be part of a larger set of regulations aimed at bringing the EU into line with international norms.
The passed regulation mirrors that suggested by the Bank for International Settlements' Basel Committee, which also suggested the highest possible risk tier weighting for holdings of “unbacked crypto.” Their recommendations placed a 2% limit on tier 1 capital that could be held denominated in unbacked cryptocurrencies. 
“There is no definition of crypto assets in the [legislation] and therefore the requirement may apply to tokenized securities, as well as the non-traditional crypto assets the interim treatment is targeted at,” the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), an EU lobby group representing finance organizations like investment banks said, indicating that the current form of the law could be unclear, but that draft issues may be fixed later on.
While the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee voted to approve the measures, in order for them to go fully into effect, they must also be approved by the European Parliament as a whole, and be presented to the national finance ministers meeting in the Council of the European Union.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-avax-hits-multi-month-peak-as-matic-jumps-to-1-week-high/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-24T16:38:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avalanche moved to a multi-month high on Jan. 24, after reports that the number of bitcoin on its network rose to 5,493. The news saw the token surge by nearly 5% today, rising for a third straight session in the process. Polygon also moved higher on Tuesday, hitting a one-week high.
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
Avalanche (AVAX) rose to a multi-month high on Tuesday, as prices rallied for a third consecutive session against a backdrop of bullish news.
 
Following a low of $17.43 to start the week, AVAX/USD moved to an intraday peak of $18.86 earlier today.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, AVAX has risen to its strongest point since Nov. 6.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move took place following a breakout of a ceiling at the $18.50 mark.
 
In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) neared a resistance level of its own at 72.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 71.11, with earlier gains fading, resulting in AVAX currently trading at $18.22.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
In addition to AVAX, polygon (MATIC) climbed higher in today’s session, following a collision with a key price floor.
 
MATIC/USD raced to a peak of $1.04 earlier in the day, less than a day after hitting a low of $0.9849
 
The move saw polygon reach its highest level since last week Monday, when price was last close to a resistance of $1.05.
 
 
However, like on that occasion, prices have since plunged, with momentum not strong enough to force a breakout.
 
As of writing, MATIC/USD is now trading at $1.00, which is also its long-term support point.
 
One positive is that the RSI seems to be a fair distance away from its own floor at 61.00, and is currently tracking at 63.27, with a ceiling of 65.00 a possible target.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrencies continued to consolidate recent gains on Jan. 24, as markets prepared for a big week of U.S. economic data. Gross domestic product (GDP) figures for Q4 2022 will be released on Thursday, followed by consumer sentiment data the day after. Ethereum also secured recent gains in today’s session, with prices nearing a move below $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated for a third straight day, as traders continued to secure gains from Saturday, when prices rose to a five-month high.
 
Despite consolidating, BTC/USD remained above $23,000 for most of today’s session, hitting a high of $23,134.01 in the process.
 
This comes less than 24 hours after it was trading at a low of $22,654.30, which is near a short-term support at $22,500.
 
 
Looking at the chart, BTC is currently trading at $22,913.54, and this comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) neared a ceiling of 86.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a level of 85.09, with a floor at 80.00 another possible destination for traders.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average has also begun to show signs of peaking, which could lead to a sudden shift in momentum.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Momentum in ethereum (ETH) somewhat slowed in today’s session, with price approaching its floor at $1,600.
 
Following a high of $1,658.02 to start the week, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,609.16 earlier in the day.
 
Sentiment in the world’s second largest cryptocurrency seems to have already shifted, with several dojis (candlesticks signaling reversal) appearing on the chart.
 
 
As can also be seen on the chart, the RSI is currently hovering slightly above a floor at 74.00, which is a current reading of 74.07.
 
Should a breakout take place, bearish pressure will likely increase, with traders potentially eyeing a move under $1,600.

Litecoin Has Continued To See Rapid Adoption Recently
 
As per a tweet from the director of the Litecoin Foundation, LTC’s growth has continued to accelerate even after surpassing Ethereum in total addresses. The “total addresses” here is an indicator from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode that measures the total number of unique addresses of a cryptocurrency that have been involved in at least one transaction (whether as a sender or a receiver) on the chain during the entire lifetime of the network.
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means users are creating new addresses on the blockchain right now, which could be a sign of new investors adopt…]]></summary>

This is an opinion editorial by Q Ghaemi, a stocks and bitcoin analyst and author of the Qweekly Update newsletter.
Earlier this month, reports surfaced that the Central Bank of Iran is working with the Russian Association Of The Crypto Industry And Blockchain to create a stablecoin that will be backed by gold to settle trade. This is not the first foray into the crypto universe for either country, nor will it be the last. But this venture will come to nothing, ultimately bringing both countries one step closer to adopting Bitcoin.
