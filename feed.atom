Bitcoin To $200,000 By 2025 End?
 
Although BTC remains range-bound, just below its all-time high (ATH) of $73,737, analysts at Bernstein believe their current price prediction of $200,000 for the digital asset by the end of 2025 is conservative.
 
 
In a client note shared today, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani wrote, “Bitcoin is going to $200,000 this cycle,” emphasizing the significance of the asset’s limited supply of 21 million, particularly in light of inflating US debt levels. He added:
