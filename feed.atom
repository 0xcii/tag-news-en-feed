Almost everyone who is doing the work to understand Bitcoin will eventually run into the cold, hard fact that, at its core, Bitcoin is about freedom. To those who have enjoyed individual liberties for their entire lives, the concept of freedom may be watered down or under appreciated. For those who live without it, freedom and individual liberty become pursuits of great importance. 
Many people who are diving into Bitcoin will find themselves at a crossroads, having to choose between the speculative “get-rich-quick” mania of some crypto subcultures and the self-sovereign, owner-and-builder mentality that Bitcoin offers.

It happened because the revenue earned from the exchange’s services was less than its expenses.
 
The regulatory barriers mainly caused Binance France to bear losses in its initial financial period. Though the crypto exchange entered the French jurisdiction in November 2021, the platform started offering trading and custody service in mid-2022 due to legal limits, resulting in a mismatch in the revenue and cost.
