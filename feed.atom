        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-miners-navigate-record-challenges-and-augusts-dual-difficulty-hike/"/>
        <updated>2023-08-23T17:36:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin miners faced another uphill battle this month, marking the second straight increase in mining difficulty. On August 22, at block height 804,384, the difficulty surged by 6.17%. This fresh peak in Bitcoin’s difficulty sets a new record, intensifying the challenge for miners in securing block rewards. 
 
Bitcoin Difficulty Jumps More Than 6% Higher
 
On August 22, 2023, Bitcoin’s network difficulty surged by 6.17%, setting a record at 55.62 trillion. This spike signals that miners will have to exert significantly more computational muscle to discover blocks. So far in August, there have been two notable shifts: a modest 0.12% increase on August 9, 2023, and the substantial 6.17% climb. Coupled with the recent dip in BTC’s value, miners are grappling with heightened challenges.
 
 
Yet, the network’s hashrate remains robust, hovering just above the 400 exahash per second (EH/s) mark. An average of 403.6 EH/s was recorded across the last 2,016 blocks, and the preceding epoch’s block time averaged 9:20 minutes. Impressively, as of Wednesday, blocks are being generated even faster, in 8 minutes, 52 seconds, suggesting that miners remain undeterred by the current turbulence. The network’s next anticipated difficulty adjustment is around September 4, 2023.
 
 
Recent data reveals that 459 blocks were produced over three days, all filled with transactions and zero empty blocks. Foundry USA leads the pack with a dominant 30.94% hashrate share, equating to 124.72 EH/s, and 142 blocks mined. Hot on the pool’s heels are Antpool and F2pool, commanding hashrate shares of 21.79% and 19.39% respectively. Average block sizes typically range between 1.6 and 1.7 million bytes among these pools. Additionally, transaction fees, as a slice of block rewards, remain consistent, floating between 1.4% and 1.91% across pools.

Ethereum Could Rebound Off The Current Market FUD
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the crowd seems to have started to bet against ETH in the past few days. There are two metrics of relevance here: the Binance Funding Rate and the Social Dominance.
 
First, the “Binance Funding Rate” keeps track of the periodic fee that Ethereum derivative contract holders on the Binance platform are paying to each other currently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Federal  
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has traced over $40 million worth of  
Bitcoin (BTC) stolen this week to Lazarus Group, a hacking group linked to the North  
Korean government.  The group, which uses malicious applications to target  
cryptocurrency companies and individuals, is also known as Trader-Traitor.
Lazarus Implicated in $40 Million Bitcoin Theft
In a  
statement released yesterday (Tuesday), the FBI noted that approximately 1,580  
BTCs were stolen and are currently being held in six BTC addresses. The US domestic  
intelligence and security service added that the group may attempt to cash out  
the stolen digital asset. 
Furthermore, the agency pointed out that hackers from the group are behind several significant crypto thefts recorded in recent  
months. These include the heist of $60 million in digital assets from Alphapo,  
the $37 million stolen from CoinsPaid, and a $100 million theft from Atomic  
Wallet, all of which were carried out in June this year. 
“The FBI  
previously provided information on their attacks against Harmony’s Horizon  
bridge and Sky Mavis’ Ronin Bridge, and provided a Cybersecurity Advisory on  
TraderTraitor,” the FBI added.
In the  
statement, the intelligence agency also called on blockchain companies to  
scrutinize the blockchain records of the BTC addresses. It further urged  
private companies to exercise caution in order to avoid transactions that are  
directly or indirectly linked to the addresses.
“The FBI  
will continue to expose and combat the DPRK’s use of illicit  
activities—including cybercrime and virtual currency theft—to generate revenue  
for the regime,” the FBI added.

        <updated>2023-08-23T16:05:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BNB was one of Wednesday’s biggest movers, as the token rebounded from a recent one-year low. The price decline came as crypto exchange Binance came under scrutiny for allegedly assisting sanctioned Russian clients in moving funds abroad. Shiba inu also rose, following recent losses.
 
BNB
 
BNB, the native token of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, rose by as much as 4% on Wednesday, following recent declines.
 
After falling to a one-year low of $204.40 on Tuesday, BNB/USD rose to an intraday peak of $216.39 earlier today.
 
Wednesday’s rally in price comes following a recent bear run, which saw the token fall lower for seven of the last nine sessions.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rebounding from a floor at 21.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 29.22, which is marginally below a ceiling at 30.00.
 
In the event that this ceiling is broken, BNB will likely move above $220.00.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Additionally, shiba inu (SHIB) was also a notable gainer in today’s session, as the meme coin recovered from a recent price dive.
 
SHIB/USD slipped to a bottom of $0.000007744 during yesterday’s session, before moving to a high of $0.00000832 on hump-day.
 
The rebound saw shiba inu rise from Tuesday’s breakout below a key price floor of $0.00000790.
 
 
Like with BNB above, the move came as the RSI bounced from a floor of its own around the 40.00 mark, with a current reading of 43.92.
 
As of now, there is a good chance that SHIB bulls are targeting exits around a resistance point of $0.00000885.

Examining the historical data of past Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) could offer valuable insights into the anticipated outcomes, particularly pertinent in the lead-up to the imminent LBank IEO. This practice has gained prominence as both investment stakeholders and project teams exhibit heightened attention towards the performance metrics of tokens enlisted across diverse exchanges.
 
H1 2023 IEO Data across Various Exchanges

Binance: Dominates in terms of sheer numbers with four tokens listed in H1 2023. Average current ROI is around 8.83x with an average ATH (All-Time High) ROI of 33.76x. This suggests a strong performance and backing for projects on Binance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to sit firmly below the $26,000 level on Wednesday, after breaking out of a key price floor. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has mostly consolidated in recent days, as traders await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole this Friday. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin moved below a key price floor late on Tuesday, as the cryptocurrency extended its streak of consolidation.
 
Following an earlier high of $26,160.78, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,520.73 late during yesterday’s session.
 
This resulted in price diving to a five-day low, and below a recent support point at the $25,600 level.

As of writing, bitcoin has since rebounded and is currently trading at $25,870.08, with the relative strength index (RSI) hovering around a floor of its own at 20.00.
 
Price strength now sits at 19.82, which remains in the depths of a bear zone, however, it also acts as a positive for longer-term bulls, as sentiment appears to have already found a bottom.
 
Friday’s Jackson Hole Symposium could provide a spark that markets have been missing in recent days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) briefly fell under the $1,600 level yesterday. However, price has gone on to recover in today’s session.
 
ETH/USD bottomed out at $1,596.38 on Tuesday, following a peak of $1,662.88 earlier in the day.
 
Similar to bitcoin, this drop pushed ethereum to its lowest point since last Thursday, which is when markets reacted to the Spacex news.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
ETH is now trading at $1,637, and comes as the RSI bounced from a support level of 22.00, and has now moved to 23.19.
 
The 27.00 mark remains the target for bulls currently in the market, with a collision likely to result in ETH rising above $1,700.
