CrediBULL Crypto has stirred the crypto community with his recent analysis, suggesting that the upcoming halving event might not be the catalyst for a bull run, as many expect.
 
Bitcoin halving events, which occur roughly every four years, have long been closely watched by investors due to their historical impact on the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory. The halving mechanism is built into the cryptocurrency’s code and reduces the block reward miners receive by half.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since launching on August 7, Paypal’s stablecoin PYUSD hasn’t received the best of welcomes. From centralization concerns to regulatory scrutiny, there are signs to suggest that the stablecoin might have a hard time settling in, and a recent development further cements this belief. 
 
Fed’s Warning To Banks
 
In a letter dated August 8, the Federal Reserve further stipulated guidelines for state member banks that may be looking to issue, offer, and trade dollar-backed stablecoins. Recall that the Fed had initially, in a press release, provided that supervised-state banks had to demonstrate to the Federal Reserve supervisors that it had put “appropriate safeguards” in place to conduct stablecoin-related transactions safely and soundly.

The AAIP’s study is primarily concerned with thoroughly assessing the data security procedures put in place by Worldcoin. The primary goal of the AAIP is to protect user privacy within Argentina’s boundaries.
 
The controversy surrounding Worldcoin’s practice of requesting iris scans from people in exchange for tokens has brought attention to this case. Numerous locations in Buenos Aires City and several regions have recorded these events.

Bitcoin Network’s Inherent Properties and the Security of PoS Chains
 
The CTO told Bitcoin.com News that proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains and app chains can also potentially benefit from the robust bitcoin-grade security that a bitcoin staking protocol brings.

However, unlike some countries where these central bank-issued digital currencies seem to be picking up steam, Canadians have not been as welcoming.

In the discussion paper titled “Unmet Payment Needs and a Central Bank Digital Currency,” the Bank of Canada highlights that one of the prominent factors serving as a hindrance to CBDC adoption in the country is that Canadians do not really have a need to.
