To back this assertion, Afek told Bitcoin.com News that only two Bitcoin mining pools control more than 50% of the network’s hashrate while the top five pools control more than 75%.
 
‘Centralization and Consolidation of Mining Resources’
 
For Afek, the concentration of the Bitcoin network’s mining power among a few players should worry decentralization proponents because it means such “centralized actors” are accountable to no one.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $30,154, up 12% in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. On October 16th, the cryptocurrency briefly spiked to around $30,000 on Binance due to false reports of an approved spot Bitcoin ETF.
