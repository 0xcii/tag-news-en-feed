        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Market participants are eagerly awaiting the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which is expected to play a crucial role in shaping the short-term outlook for Bitcoin and other digital assets. The spotlight is on the potential for an interest rate cut, and many traders and investors have been speculating about it for some time now. 
 
Although the exact magnitude of the rate cut has not yet been confirmed, there is widespread anticipation that the FOMC will opt for either a 25-basis point reduction or a more substantial 50-basis point cut. According to a prominent economist, FOMC’s decision could either lead to a sell-the-news event for risky assets like Bitcoin or give them a boost.

His legal team contends that Lewis Kaplan, the presiding judge, was biased and that the narrative of the case was mostly against him. Currently serving a 25-year jail sentence, Bankman- Fried argues he did not act illegally and that the evidence offered during the trial was unfairly constrained.
 
Claims Of Judicial Bias
 
Bankman-Fried’s lawyers, in their appeal to the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals, said Judge Kaplan was favoring the prosecution, and with that, he was compromising the fairness of the trial.
