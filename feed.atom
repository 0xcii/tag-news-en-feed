        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-rebounds-on-tuesday-as-avax-hits-1-week-high/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-05T15:42:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp rose for a second consecutive session on Wednesday, as the token continued to move away from a recent price floor. Since hitting an eleven-month high a week ago, the token has mostly consolidated. Avalanche was also in the green, as prices hit a one-week high.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was a notable gainer in today’s session, as prices continued to move away from a recent support point.
 
Following a low of $0.4972 on Tuesday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.5256 earlier in today’s session.
 
This came as bulls continued to move away from a floor at $0.49500, following a breakout earlier in the week.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that this took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a support of its own at 59.00 .
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 61.24, with the next visible ceiling at the 63.00 mark.
 
As a result of this upcoming hurdle, earlier bulls have already moved to liquidate gains, with XRP now trading lower at $0.5137.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
Another notable gainer on Tuesday was avalanche (AVAX), which moved to a one-week high.
 
AVAX/USD moved to a peak at $18.31 earlier in today’s session, after falling to a low of $17.29 the day prior.
 
The surge saw avalanche climb to its strongest point since March 23, and came following a move beyond a ceiling at $18.00.
 
 
Since then, earlier gains have somewhat fallen as a result of the RSI hitting a wall at the 56.00 level.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 55.63, which has resulted in AVAX once again trading below $18.00.
