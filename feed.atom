        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the first week of H2 2023, non-fungible token (NFT) sales witnessed a 23.39% decline compared to the previous week, marking a two-week downward trend. A total of $195.95 million worth of NFT sales occurred, with Ethereum-based NFTs accounting for $130.77 million.
 
NFT Sales Take a Hit: Week-Over-Week Drop of 23% in the First Week of July 2023
 
Cryptoslam.io data reveals a 23.39% drop in NFT sales this week compared to the earlier week. Along with this downturn, there was a notable 96.48% decrease in NFT buyers and a 15.26% slide in the number of NFT sales. ETH-based NFT sales led the pack with 66.73% of total sales, reaching $130.77 million last week.
 
 
Despite their dominance, ETH NFT sales saw a 14.77% dip compared to the previous week. Among 22 networks, Bitcoin (BTC) ranked second in terms of sales, recording $23.37 million last week and experiencing a 34.99% slump week-over-week. Ethereum and Bitcoin were followed by Solana, BNB, and Polygon in weekly sales.
 
 
Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) emerged as the highest-selling NFT collection over the past week, generating $22.57 million in revenue and growing by 1% compared to the prior week. Azuki, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), Uncategorized Ordinals, and Fram BRC20 trailed behind BAYC. Fram BRC20 NFT sales surged by an impressive 97.47%. Captainz and Degods also recorded significant gains between 43% and 70%, respectively.
 
 
Of the top five NFT collectible sales this week, three originated from the Bitcoin blockchain while two were based on Ethereum. The priciest sale was an Uncategorized Ordinal that fetched $832K; however, no single NFT or digital collectible breached the million-dollar mark this week.

BTC has skyrocketed by 77%, while ETH has experienced an impressive 44% leap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana extended recent gains on Saturday, as the token rose for a third straight session to start the weekend. Today’s move came following a breakout of a key price level, despite the global crypto market cap consolidating. Avalanche also rallied, climbing by as much as 10%.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was a notable gainer in the crypto market for a third straight day, with today’s move taking price to an eight-week high.
 
Following a low of $20.19 on Friday, SOL/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $22.40 to start the weekend.
 
As a result of the surge, solana raced past a ceiling of $22.00, hitting its highest point since May 6 in the process.
 
 
From the chart, the move occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped beyond a ceiling at the 69.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 70.70, with the next visible point of resistance at 75.00.
 
Should the index reach this point, there is a good chance that SOL will climb to $23.00.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
Another notable gainer on Saturday was avalanche (AVAX), which rose by nearly 10% in today’s session.
 
AVAX/USD climbed to a high of $13.85 earlier in today’s session, a day after trading at a low of $12.60.
 
The move resulted in avalanche jumping to its strongest level since June 9, after breaking out of a resistance level of $13.50.
 
 
One of the catalysts of this rally was the 14-day RSI breaking out of its own ceiling at the 57.00 mark.
 
The index is now tracking at 58.73, and looks to be making strides for a higher point of resistance at 62.00.
 
Additionally, the 10-day (red) moving average has just avoided a downward crossover, with momentum once again shifting upward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was hovering near the $30,000 level to start the weekend, as markets continued to digest the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. Payrolls came in at 209,000, less than the 225,000 expected, putting slight doubt in a potential July rate hike. Ethereum continued to trade below $1,900 on Saturday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the weekend consolidating around the $30,000 level, following the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $30,094.87, a day after trading at a one-year high above $31,000.
 
The price has marginally increased following today’s earlier row, and is now trading at $30,240.85.
 
 
Overall, it appears that a failed breakout of a ceiling at 58.00 on the relative strength index (RSI) was the catalyst of this drop.
 
Price strength is now tracking at the 57.63 level, with a support point at 55.00 a possible target for traders.
 
Should it reach this point, it is highly likely that BTC will move below $30,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also started the weekend consolidating, with the cryptocurrency once again moving below $1,900.
 
Since hitting a peak at $1,957 on Thursday, ETH/USD has failed to trade above $1,900, with today’s drop taking price to a low of $1,854.92.
 
After reaching a two-month high on June 3, ethereum has struggled, with price falling lower in consecutive sessions.
 
 
These declines have pushed price strength to a floor at 47.00, however this support point has so far been stable, helping to stop the prior bleeding.
 
The index is now tracking at a reading of 49.59, with an upcoming resistance level of 51.00 the next test for traders.
 
In the event they pass this test, the next destination for price will likely be back above $1,900.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Binance, some of its executives have decided to leave the firm. This legal action also sparked criticism regarding alleged preferential treatment given to Coinbase, a US-based crypto exchange.
 
The lawsuit has prompted discussions about whether the SEC’s aggressive enforcement measures played a role in the departure of several high-ranking executives from Binance’s US division.
 
However, these departing individuals have stated that their reasons for leaving are unrelated to the ongoing lawsuit.
