        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is experiencing significant volatility and uncertainty after falling below the $60,000 mark. This dip has sparked mixed reactions among investors. Some view it as a potential bear trap, indicating that the price may soon rally, while others fear that the market could be headed for a deeper correction. 
 
Despite the conflicting sentiments, critical data from CryptoQuant reveals that Bitcoin whales have accumulated BTC heavily over the past six months.
 
 
As the price hovers just above the key $60,000 level, many investors speculate about the current market conditions. Could this prolonged accumulation period by large holders signal a bullish outlook for the coming months? Or is the market still at risk of further downside?

In fact, it is responsible for almost 25% of the total crypto inflows of Latin America, outweighing that of Brazil at 18%, data from Chainalysis shows.

Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed Below $60,000
 
The Bitcoin price crashed below $60,000 following the release of the US CPI inflation data. The CPI showed that inflation in the US hit 2.4% in September, higher than expectations.
