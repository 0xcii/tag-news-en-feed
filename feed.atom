But according to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, patience remains key.
 
 
Gensler Throws Cold Water On Rapid Launch Hopes
 
In a recent interview with CNBC, Gensler tempered expectations, stating that final approvals for individual ETFs “will likely take some time.”
 
This suggests that the review process will likely take a long time, which could postpone the establishment of Ethereum ETFs, according to Eleanor Terrett, a writer for Fox Business.  However, Gensler did offer a glimmer of hope, acknowledging that the process is underway.

Bitcoin Whales Have Been In Buying Mode Since Mid-March
 
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the BTC whales have been increasing their supply since the middle of March. The “whales” here refer to the Bitcoin addresses carrying more than 1,000 BTC in their balance.
 
 
At the current exchange rate of the cryptocurrency, this amount converts to around $71.4 million, which is quite quite massive. Because of these large holdings, the whales are considered influential entities on the network.

This decrease, roughly 20.1% from the previous month, marks a continued downtrend following the muted price activity of Bitcoin after its April Halving.
 
Crypto Exchange Landscape And Institutional Interest
 
According to CCData reports, this deceleration affects both spot and derivatives markets. Spot trading diminished by 21.6% to reach $1.57 trillion. The decline was slightly less steep at 19.4% on the derivatives front, totaling $3.69 trillion.
 
 
Despite the overall drop, derivatives trading claimed an increased market share, a shift attributed to the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s unexpected endorsement of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF…]]></summary>

The lawsuit, being heard at the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), accuses Binance and other exchanges of conspiring to “delist” the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) cryptocurrency.
 
BSV Delisting Controversy
 
The case, brought on behalf of over 200,000 BSV coin owners, alleges that Binance and other exchanges engaged in “anti-competitive behavior” by delisting the BSV token in 2019. 
 
 
Lawyers representing BSV Claims, the entity pursuing the case, contend that the delisting caused a significant drop in BSV’s value and hindered its potential to become a “top tier” cryptocurrency, leading to a claim valued at up to £9…]]></summary>

According to a Bloomberg report, Ver’s arrest in late April in Spain led to his release on May 17, after posting €150,000 ($163,000) in bail. However, he was required to surrender his passport, remain in Spain, and appear in court every two days. The prosecutor’s subsequent appeal against Ver’s release was rejected two weeks later.
