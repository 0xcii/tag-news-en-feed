Is The Bitcoin Bear Run Over? Prices Retest The 100-Day Moving Average
 
Though there are risks, one analyst on X is upbeat. In a post, the trader noted that prices have retested the 100-day moving average. Historically, whenever Bitcoin has dipped to or slightly below this level, it has marked a local bottom, followed by a significant upward rally. 
 
 
Looking at the daily chart, the analyst notes that the most recent instance occurred in January, where a price test of the 100-day moving average preceded a 90% surge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The  
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has issued a stark warning, including  
cryptocurrencies, to students and young job seekers: beware of becoming an  
unwitting "money mule."
In a recent  
advisory, the CFTC's Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO) cautioned  
that criminal organizations target young people with seemingly easy,  
stay-at-home job offers that involve moving money through bank accounts or  
digital wallets.
Money Mules and Crypto  
Warning
Although  
the CFTC's warning primarily concerns the phenomenon of "money  
mules," it largely also pertains to cryptocurrencies. The agency suggests  
that their decentralization and anonymity make them frequently used for  
potentially illegal transactions.

However, bullishness has prevailed despite the altcoin’s disappointing performance in 2024, with one analyst pretending an end to what has been a drawn-out accumulation trend.
 
XRP Price To Breakout As Accumulation Trend Ends
 
Crypto analyst U-Copy took to X (formerly Twitter) to share their prediction for the XRP price. The chart attached with the post puts the altcoin in a 7-year accumulation trend, which is set to end soon and trigger an upward rally for the price.

While altcoins shiver in the shadows of Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent 5% dip, PEPE is strutting its stuff with a sizable surge in the past month and a near 6% daily climb.
 
This bullish behavior has analysts like Crypto Tony croaking enthusiastically about a potential all-time high (ATH) for the meme coin.
 
A Beacon In The Bear Market
 
Unlike its altcoin brethren who crumbled during the recent market slump, the meme coin stood firm. This resilience suggests an underlying strength that could be attracting new investors and boosting investor confidence.
