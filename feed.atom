SEC Goes After Impact Theory NFTs
 
Impact Theory was one of many entertainment firms that launched its own NFT collection when the issuance and sales of NFTs exploded in 2021, taking advantage of the growing popularity of non-fungible tokens at the time. 
 
 
The proceeds from the sale of this collection were reportedly up to $30 million and according to the SEC’s charges, Impact Theory had promised buyers that the non-fungible tokens would appreciate in value, promising that the purchase of the tokens meant investors were making investments in …]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-29T16:20:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BNB surged this afternoon, as markets reacted to the news a court in the United States was siding with Grayscale in its case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The court said the SEC was wrong to deny Grayscale permission to migrate its bitcoin product into an ETF. Toncoin also rallied, hitting its strongest point since June. 
 
BNB
 
Since hitting a one-year low last week, BNB has mostly moved higher in recent days, with today’s surge coming after the latest U.S. consumer confidence report.
 
Following a low of $217.05 to start the week, BNB/USD moved to a peak of $233.06 earlier in today’s session.
 
This has resulted in the native token of cryptocurrency exchange Binance climbing to its highest point since August 16.
 
 
Tuesday’s gain came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) jumped beyond a key resistance level of 53.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking marginally above this point at 54.13, with a ceiling at 55.00 awaiting.
 
Earlier gains have somewhat diminished, as traders liquidated their positions in fear of a reversal close to this zone.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was another notable gainer on Tuesday, as it raced to its highest point in over two months.
 
TON/USD climbed to an intraday high at $1.63 earlier in today’s session, following a low of $1.49 on Monday.
 
As a result of this rise in price, toncoin has moved to its strongest level since June 10, when it peaked at $1.68.
 
 
This comes as the RSI jumped past a resistance level of 66.00. It currently tracking at 70.41.
 
Due to price strength being overbought, bears are likely going to be lurking, and waiting for an opportunity to reenter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, it was announced that the DC Circuit court of appeals is vacating SEC's denial of Grayscale's $GBTC conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF. 
"We agree," said Circuit Judge RAO. "The denial of Grayscale's proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products. We therefore grant Grayscale's petition and vacate the order."
 
         
         
         
         
    
It is important to note that this does not mean GBTC is automatically being converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, although this victory does bring us one step closer to that reality. The order is being vacated and sent back to the SEC. The SEC now has 45 days to appeal and file for an en banc hearing, which means the case will be heard by all 17 judges on the court instead of just the three that were involved in today's decision, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. 
"The Commission neither disputed Grayscale's evidence that the spot and future markets for bitcoin are 99.9% correlated, nor suggested that market inefficiencies or other factors would undermine the correlation...The Commission’s unexplained discounting of the obvious financial and mathematical relationship between the spot and futures markets falls short of the standard for reasoned decision making," Circuit Judge RAO. continued.
