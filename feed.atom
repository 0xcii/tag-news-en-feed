The case, Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, signals a significant shift in the balance of power between the judiciary and administrative agencies. This decision not only reinforces judicial independence but also presents substantial benefits for the Bitcoin industry, echoing the implications of last year’s West Virginia v. EPA decision.

Over 25 Million Ordinals Inscribed On Litecoin
 
According to Litecoin, over 25 million ordinals have been inscribed on the proof-of-work network as of June 27. Of note, a record-breaking 1.5 million were added in just two weeks, a massive development and a shot in the arm for the proof-of-work network.
 
 
Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, where fees are relatively high, transacting on Litecoin is cheaper. The low fee could be due to the lower transaction activity and better scalability, unlike the world’s most valuable coin.
