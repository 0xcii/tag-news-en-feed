The newly proposed measures aim to protect consumers and bring more transparency to crypto platforms operating in New York. 
 
The NYDFS-delivered new crypto rules mandate that licensees only list and delist a crypto coin if they notify the authority about it. Licensed entities must also submit their policies to the department on how they list and delist a crypto token. 
 
According to the proposed regulations, crypto entities cannot self-certify a crypto asset for trading until they secure regulatory approval over their policies.
