Ripple IPO Not So Soon?
 
Eri emphasized the importance of contextual analysis, stating, “When you hear people discuss Ripple IPO, comparisons should be made with similar types of companies.” She used the example of Ripple Partner Nium Global, which has postponed its U.S. IPO to possibly the second quarter of 2025. She highlighted Nium Global’s recent launch of a liquidity hub, Global FX, which offers a solution to lock and hold an FX rate for up to 24 hours.
