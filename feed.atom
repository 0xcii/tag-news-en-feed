        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-shib-hits-6-week-high-etc-extends-recent-gains/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-13T16:40:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was one of Friday’s biggest gainers, as the meme coin raced to a six-week high. The move came as the global cryptocurrency market cap surged, as U.S. inflationary pressures continued to cool off. Ethereum classic was also in the green, with price hitting a two-month high.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was one of Friday’s notable movers, as the meme coin moved to a six-week high.
 
Following a low of $0.000009227 on Thursday, SHIB/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.000009711 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of today’s surge, the meme coin hit its highest point since December 5, when it traded as high as $0.00001016.
 
Looking at the chart, the move came as shiba inu climbed beyond a ceiling at the $0.00000945 mark.
 
 
In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved past a ceiling of its own at 68.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 71.74, which is deep in overbought territory.
 
 
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
 
Ethereum classic (ETC) was another big gainer in today’s session, with prices moving closer to a two-month high.
 
ETC/USD rose to a high of $21.76 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after hitting a bottom at $20.02.
 
This move pushed the token to its strongest level since November 10, when ETC hit a resistance of $23.00.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, bulls appear to be attempting to take ethereum classic back to this point, if recent bullish momentum can be sustained.
 
This will likely be made difficult by a resistance level of 67.00 on the RSI, which hasn’t been broken since last August.

Multiple crypto businesses have been severely impacted by the crypto winter, forcing them to lay off a large number of employees.
 
Blockchain.com announced it is reducing its workforce by 28%, leading to approximately 110 employees being laid off by the company. The recent round of terminations is the second in less than a year after Blockchain.com cut 150 employees in the month of July last year.
 
 
Blockchain.com cited the current market climate as the reason behind the layoffs as the company struggled with a massive loss of $270 million in loans it made to fund the now-bankrupt Three Arrows Capital hedge fund.

Bitcoin Miners Might Find Relief After A Period Of Immense Pressure
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the average cost of production for miners is now around the current price levels. The relevant indicator here is the “difficulty regression model,” which is an estimation of the cost of Bitcoin production that the average miner incurs.
 
As the name already implies, this model is based on the concept of “mining difficulty,” which is a built-in feature on the BTC blockchain that decides how hard miners will need to work in order to successfully mine a block on the network.
 
For this model, Glassnode has made the…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-01-13T13:35:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to trade higher on Jan. 13, with prices racing above the $19,000 level, hitting a two-month peak in the process. The latest surge comes as traders continued to react to Wednesday’s U.S. inflation report, which dropped to 6.5%. Ethereum also rose today, hitting a fresh multi-month high.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a two-month high earlier in today’s session, as prices climbed above the $19,000 mark.
 
Following a low of $17,995.20 on Thursday, BTC/USD moved to a peak of $19,031.80 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed to its strongest point since November 8, when price was above $20,000.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose to a peak of 82.00, which was its highest mark in over a year.
 
In addition to this, the upwards trend on the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages continued to mature, thus extending bullish momentum.
 
Despite this, prices are now well beyond overbought, which could mean that bears are lurking and preparing for reentry.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Like BTC, ethereum (ETH) also significantly rose on Friday, with price moving above the $1,400 mark.
 
ETH/USD hit an intraday high of $1,432.28 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after trading at a bottom of $1,378.42.
 
As with bitcoin, this spike in price has pushed ethereum to its highest point since November 8, when it hit a high of $1,580.
 
 
From the chart, prices of ETH are now deep in overbought territory, with the RSI index tracking at a level of 75.54.
 
Earlier gains have already begun to slip, as previous bulls have begun taking profits in anticipation of a reversal in momentum.
 
As of writing, ETH/USD is trading at $1,410.60.
