        <updated>2023-08-08T16:06:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chainlink surged by nearly 4% during Tuesday’s session, as the token moved towards a one-week high. The move came as cryptocurrencies rebounded, following a slow start to the week. Solana was another big mover, as it headed towards the $24.00 level.
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) was one of Tuesday’s biggest movers, as price surged by as much as 4% during the session.
 
LINK/USD hit an intraday peak of $7.42 earlier in the day, following a low of $7.00 to start the week.
 
Yesterday’s bottom was also a long-term support point, with bulls choosing to reject a breakout on this occasion.
 
 
This comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to move away from a floor at the 48.00 mark.
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 52.20, close to a resistance zone of 53.00.
 
In the event this level is breached, there is a strong possibility that LINK could move towards $7.50.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) also made strong gains on Tuesday, with bulls pushing price towards the $24.00 level.
 
After starting the week at a low of $22.49, SOL/USD raced to an intraday peak of $23.68, earlier in the day.
 
Momentum seems to have shifted in favor of the bulls, with solana now trading at its highest point since last Wednesday.
 
 
This is now the third consecutive day that SOL has edged higher, resulting in the RSI nearing a collision with a ceiling at 53.00
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 51.87, with a move to the aforementioned target likely to result in SOL moving above $24.00.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan contend that the recent plunge in Treasuries has been excessive, urging investors to seize the opportunity to buy. Warren Buffett, unfazed by Fitch’s downgrade of U.S. debt, persists in purchasing billions in Treasuries weekly for Berkshire Hathaway.

        <updated>2023-08-08T13:02:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded on Tuesday, following the news that Paypal was launching a USD stablecoin on the ethereum blockchain. The company hopes the move will bridge the gap between fiat and cryptocurrencies for all of its stakeholders. Ethereum was marginally higher today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was back in the green on Tuesday, as the cryptocurrency made marginal gains during today’s session.
 
The move came as Paypal announced its USD stablecoin, which will be hosted on the ethereum blockchain.
 
Following the news, CEO Dan Schulman said: “Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through Paypal USD.”
 
 
BTC/USD rose to a peak of $29,402.65 on the news, following a low of $28,724.14 the day prior.
 
Today’s peak sees bitcoin trade at its highest point since last Wednesday, when it was last above $30,000.
 
Tuesday’s rally has also brought the 10-day (red) moving average to the cusp of an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rose marginally after the Paypal news, with price moving away from a recent support point.
 
Following a low of $1,804.72 to start the week, ETH/USD jumped to an intraday high of $1,836.06 on Tuesday.
 
Despite the slight rise in price, ethereum continues to trade below a recent resistance level of $1,850.
 
 
A positive for bulls, however, comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of its ceiling at the 43.00 mark.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at a reading of 43.88, with the next resistance zone near the 50.00 point.
 
In the event this target is reached, ETH will likely be back above $1,900.
