        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin dropped to a multi-week low on Saturday, as a red wave continues to wash away recent crypto bulls. The meme coin dropped below a key price floor at $0.080 following today’s plunge. Shiba inu was also lower to start the weekend, falling by as much as 3%.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) moved to a three-week low to start the weekend, as bears pushed the meme coin below a key price level.
 
Following a high of $0.08435 on Friday, DOGE/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.07752 in today’s session.
 
Saturday’s decline saw DOGE fall below a long-term support point at $0.080, hitting its weakest point since April 3.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that dogecoin has found a new floor at near the $0.0760 mark, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) also consolidated.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 43.21, which is close to a support point at 42.00.
 
The next visible resistance level looks to be at 51.00, and should bulls begin to move towards this, DOGE will soon be back above $0.090.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Another meme coin in the red on Saturday was shiba inu (SHIB) which also slipped to a multi-week low.
 
SHIB/USD dropped to a low of $0.00001012 to start the weekend, less than 24 hours after trading at a peak of $0.00001064
 
This is the lowest level that shiba inu has hit since March 11, and comes following a four-day losing streak.
 
 
The recent mini-bear run has now pushed the 10-day (red) moving average to the brink of a downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
As of writing this, shiba inu continues to hover close to an area of support at the $0.00001020 level.
 
Price strength is also marginally above a floor of its own at 37.00.

This is an opinion editorial by Steven Hay, a writer, former trader and art dealer.
I’m a long-time Bitcoiner, preparing to travel and hopefully relocate permanently to El Salvador in 2023. Like many Bitcoiners, I wish to be a part of the amazing changes happening in this country. And I’d like to share an idea which I strongly believe has the potential to accelerate those changes.
Similar to the volcano bond concept, this idea employs Bitcoin-linked assets to raise funds for the building of Bitcoin City, or any other worthy project. Unlike bonds, however, these relatively-straightforward assets impose no…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-eth-falls-under-the-1900-level-to-start-the-weekend/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-22T12:14:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum started the weekend trading below $1,900 for the first time in two weeks, as cryptocurrency markets continued to fall. The global market cap is down by close to 3% at the time of writing this. Bitcoin was also in red, as it moved closer to $27,000.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was in the red for a fourth consecutive session, as prices neared a breakout below $27,000.
 
BTC/USD plunged to a low of $27,169.57 to start the weekend, a day after trading at a high of $28,291.60.
 
Saturday’s drop in price resulted in bitcoin falling to its lowest point in roughly three and a half weeks.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this latest downturn has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average closer to a cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index is now tracking at 41.73, which is marginally higher than its long-term floor at 41.00.
 
If price strength were to slip below this point, there is a good chance that BTC will move toward $26,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) continued to trend lower on Saturday, as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency dropped below $1,900.
 
Following a high of $1,926.30 on Friday, ETH/USD fell to an intraday low at $1,827.79 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this move, ethereum started the weekend by declining to its weakest level since April 9.
 
 
Today’s price slippage also resulted in ETH briefly breaking out of an interim support point at $1,830.
 
Bulls swiftly reentered the market seemingly buying the dip, and this has resulted in ethereum now trading at $1,848.66.
 
Although there is likely to be further declines in the coming days, once this current red wave passes, there may be a significant reversal.

Development activity for the blockchain has been steadily declining for the past two months, raising concerns about the future of Terra’s growth and adoption. 
 
As the blockchain world evolves rapidly, can Terra find a way to reverse this trend?
 
 
Bearish Outlook For LUNA
 
Terra’s LUNA coin is currently priced at $1.21 on CoinMarketCap, with a 24-hour trading volume of $38,388,955. Unfortunately, the last 24 hours have been very challenging for the cryptocurrency, as it has experienced a 4.29% decrease in value.

However the past week has provided cause for positivity as staked assets have begun to return to pre-Shapella levels. 
 
Validators’ Confidence Restored In Recent Days
 
This trend began on April 17, when there were more deposits than withdrawals for the first time since the Shapella update. At the end of the day, there was about 68,000 ETH staked on the Ethereum network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
