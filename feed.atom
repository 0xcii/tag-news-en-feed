Why Now Might Be A Good Time To Invest In DOGE
 
In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Kaleo reminded the crypto community of how the world’s richest man and X owner, Elon Musk, changed the X logo to Dogecoin a couple of days after April 1 last year. The crypto expert further revealed that he had already positioned himself just in case Musk does it again this time around. 
 
Last year, Dogecoin’S price jumped by over 30% after Musk replaced X’s logo with the Shiba Inu dog (which happens to be DOGE’s logo). As such, Kaleo expects the meme coin to enjoy a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the US government sent a transaction that appears to indicate it may be on the verge of liquidating the remaining Bitcoin it confiscated from the online marketplace Silk Road.
According to on-chain data, a 0.001 BTC test transaction, part of a larger stash of approximately 30,174 BTC worth $2 billion linked to the infamous Silk Road marketplace, were moved by the US government.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, received the transaction from these Silk Road-related funds. Arkham Intelligence first identified the origins of where the BTC was coming from, and the coins destination of Coinbase. It appears the purpose of this transaction is to sell the coins, as it has previously done in the past.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
Last March, the U.S. government sold off 10,000 bitcoin related to Silk Road, selling just over 9,861 BTC worth $216 million, according to a court filing.
As in this case, this event was proceeded by 3 on-chain transactions, which were sent a few weeks prior to the sale's disclosure in a court filing.
The U.S. Marshals Service is one of the largest Bitcoin sellers to date. According to data from researcher Jameson Lopp, the US Marshals have helped the US government sell 195,000 BTC.
Despite attempts by U.S. lawmakers to have the agency hold these funds as a strategic asset, it has continued to sell the funds in line with its mandate, the role of the U.S. Marshalls Service being to sell off assets confiscated in criminal investigations.]]></summary>

Will Bitcoin Breakout Higher From The Pennant?
 
Despite the current dip, the analyst notes that technical analysis of the daily chart has printed a bullish pennant formation. If buyers step in, rejecting the current lower lows, the coin may surge above recent all-time highs and soar to new territories.
 
 
Bitcoin is within a bullish pattern from an effort-versus-result perspective in the daily chart. The coin is down 5% in the past 24 hours and 7% in the last week of trading. Trading at around the $66,000 level, the coin is down 11% from all-time highs and under pressure.
