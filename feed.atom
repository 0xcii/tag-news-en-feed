SBF’s Guilty Verdict Is Correct: But Not Time To Celebrate
 
Taking to X on November 3, Adams, one of the influential figures in decentralized finance (DeFi), said though the jury might be correct in their decision, it might not be the right time to celebrate.

According to a recent post, Havel’s journey began with delving into “PlayStation jailbreaking,” where he discovered vulnerabilities in older PlayStation 4 firmware that allowed for control takeover. 
 
Jailbreaking refers to bypassing the restrictions imposed by the official software (firmware) of a device, in this case, a PlayStation 4 console. 
 
By jailbreaking the console, the researcher, Mario Havel, gained unauthorized access to the system, allowing him to run custom software and applications and make modifications not typically allowed by the manufacturer.
