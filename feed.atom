        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Billionaire Bill Ackman has warned that the U.S. economy is “heading for a train wreck” if the government allows the current banking crisis to continue. “Trust and confidence are earned over many years, but can be wiped out in a few days,” he said. “Hopefully, our regulators will get this right.”
 
Bill Ackman’s Warning
 
Billionaire Bill Ackman, CEO and portfolio manager of Pershing Square Capital Management, has warned of an incoming train wreck. Pershing Square is a hedge fund management company with approximately $18.5 billion in assets under management. Ackman’s net worth is about $3.4 billion.

        <updated>2023-03-25T23:37:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The famous author of the best-selling book Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has warned that the Federal Reserve’s continued rate hikes will crash stocks, bonds, real estate, as well as the U.S. dollar. He expects the next crash to be the “$1 quadrillion derivatives market.”
 
Robert Kiyosaki on Interest Rate Hikes, Market Crashes
 
The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, reiterated his warnings of market crashes and the danger of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates this week. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.
 
Kiyosaki tweeted Thursday:
 

Raising interest rates will crash stocks, bonds, real estate, & $ U.S. dollar. Next crash: $1 quadrillion derivatives market. $1 quadrillion is $1 thousand trillion.
 
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) on Wednesday. While a number of people expect the Fed to start cutting rates soon, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that rate cuts are not in the Fed’s base case.
 
 
This was not the first time Kiyosaki has warned about stocks, bonds, real estate, and the U.S. dollar crashing. Last week, the famous author discussed a “crash landing ahead” as bank bailouts began following the collapse of major banks, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. He also predicted the end of the U.S. dollar, calling the USD “fake money.”
 
The renowned author also recently predicted that the world economy is on the verge of collapse, expecting bank runs, frozen savings, and bail-ins. In February, he said that everything will crash. Earlier this year, he said we are in a global recession, warning of soaring bankruptcies, unemployment, and homelessness.

This is an opinion editorial by Plumski, a native of Serbia and founder of the Belgrade Bitcoin Hub.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-climbs-5-as-ltc-nears-multi-week-high-on-saturday/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-25T14:38:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto asset xrp rose by as much as 5% on Saturday, following declines of a similar amount during yesterday’s session. This comes despite the global crypto market cap moving lower, falling by 0.51% at the time of writing. Litecoin was also higher to start the weekend.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was back in the green on Saturday, as the token rebounded from Friday’s losses.
 
Following a low of $0.418, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4501 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move came as bullish momentum increased at the price floor of $0.4250, after bears failed to sustain an earlier breakout.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the rebound took place as the relative strength index (RSI) moved away from its own support, at 58.00
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 60.77, and seems to be heading towards a ceiling at the 63.00 mark.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average has also extended its upward cross versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could be a sign of upcoming gains.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC), was another notable mover to start the weekend, as prices remained close to a multi-week high.
 
LTC/USD climbed to a peak of $93.97 on Saturday, which comes less than 24 hours after a low of $89.87.
 
As a result of this, litecoin is now trading close to a ceiling of $94.00, and a recent three-week high of $96.11.
 
 
One catalyst for the rally was a recent crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
In addition to this, the RSI is now tracking at 57.07, which is marginally above a resistance level of 56.00.
 
Should bullish momentum continue to rise, there is a strong possibility that LTC will move beyond $100.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved close to a breakout below $27,000 on Saturday, as markets moved lower following a volatile week of trading. Market uncertainty was high this week, as traders digested the latest Federal Reserve interest rate hike, as well as the on-going global banking crisis. Ethereum remains below $1,800 as of writing.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the weekend consolidating below the $28,000 mark, as market volatility eased on Saturday .
 
Following a high of $28,208.21 on Friday, BTC/USD moved to an intraday low of $27,039.27 earlier today.
 
As a result of the move, bitcoin collided with a floor at the $27,050 level, however bulls have so far rejected a breakout below this point.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s sell-off took place as the relative strength index (RSI) fell below a floor of its own, at the 65.00 mark.
 
As of writing this, the index is now tracking at the 62.75 level, with the next visible point of support at the 60.00 mark..
 
Overall, BTC has rebounded from earlier lows, and at the time of writing, is trading at $27,475.15.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also edged lower to start the weekend, as prices continued to fall from a recent seven-month high.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,730.35 in today’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $1,791.14.
 
The move pushed ethereum to its long-term floor at $1,730, with buys opting to buy the dip at the point.
 
 
This recent drop in price has pushed ethereum’s RSI to its lowest point in two-week, with a current reading of 55.39.
 
Momentum still remains marginally bullish, as seen by the 10-day (red) moving average, however should prices move below $1,730, that could change.

        <updated>2023-03-25T08:07:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent review of Nigerian banks’ bond portfolios showed that the institutions were not directly exposed to Silicon Valley Bank, the governor of the country’s central bank has said. In addition, the governor said the Central Bank of Nigeria’s stringent guidelines help to create a “very safe” banking system. 
 
Priority Given to Depositors
 
According to the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, a recent review of Nigerian banks’ bond portfolios showed that the country’s financial institutions had no direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Emefiele, who made the remarks during a meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee, added that the central bank’s so-called prudential guidelines help to ensure that only healthy banks are allowed to operate.
 
Some of the guidelines and considerations used by the CBN include banks’ non-performing loans (NPL), which averaged 4.2%, and the capital adequacy ratio of 13.7%. According to Emefiele, these ratios, as well as the banks’ average liquidity and loan-to-deposit ratios of 43% and 52% respectively, indicate that Nigerian banks are “very safe.”
 

 
Also, in his remarks published by Nairametrics, Emefiele implied that the central bank has and will always prioritize bank customers.
 
“We will rather dispose of shareholders than make depositors lose money,” Emefiele said.
 
To support this claim, Emefiele is quoted in the report stating no Nigerian depositor has lost money to a failed bank since 2003.
