        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lava Loans protocol (v2) is a scheme designed by Lava building upon Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) to facilitate a trustless Bitcoin collateralized loan system. The huge implosion in the market last cycle caused by centralized platforms facilitating Bitcoin backed loans showed that left unchecked, such products and services can present a massive systemic risk to the entire market in the ecosystem. 
Lava seeks to provide the same utility users of such centralized platforms sought in a decentralized and atomic fashion, using DLCs. 
DLCs, for those unfamiliar with the concept, are a smart contract designed to settle a certain way depending on the outcome of some event outside of the Bitcoin protocol, i.e. the price of Bitcoin, the outcome of a sports game, etc. This is done by depending on…]]></summary>

        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e746dc2b479</id>
        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/75-of-bitcoin-hasnt-moved-in-6-months-signaling-strong-hodling-trend"/>
        <updated>2024-08-16T17:05:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent data from Bitcoin Magazine Pro shows a significant trend among Bitcoin holders: nearly 75% of all circulating Bitcoin has remained dormant for over six months. This strong HODLing behavior reflects a steadfast belief in Bitcoin's long-term value, despite market fluctuations.
 
                         
                         
                        
Bitcoin Magazine Pro X
 
                     
                    
The "HODL Waves" chart, a tool that visualizes the age of Bitcoins based on when they last moved, illustrates how various groups of holders react to market conditions. The dominance of older coins (those held for 6 months or more) suggests that long-term investors are increasingly holding onto their Bitcoin, possibly anticipating future price increases.
This trend of HODLing is significant because it indicates a reduced supply of Bitcoin available for trading, which could lead to increased price stability or even potential price appreciation as demand grows. The data also highlights the contrast between short-term traders and long-term investors, with the latter group—often considered 'smart money'—likely to hold their positions during periods of market volatility.
For new Bitcoin investors, this trend emphasizes the potential benefits of adopting a long-term investment strategy. Consistently buying and holding Bitcoin over time, rather than attempting to time the market, aligns with the behavior of those who have historically seen the most significant gains holding Bitcoin.
