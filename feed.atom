        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu ecosystem has been under extreme pressure in recent weeks as a wave of controversy dealt a blow to the confidence of investors in the ecosystem.

However, investors seem thrilled about the recent release of the Shibarium testnet called PuppyNet. This overcame the FUD surrounding the ecosystem, showing investors that SHIB is resilient even with the odds stacked against them. 
 
However, the confidence seemed to be shaken with CoinGecko showing SHIB shedding more than 6% in the weekly timeframe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite Bitcoin’s difficulty reaching an all-time high at 46.84 trillion, participants in bitcoin mining have kept the hashrate running stronger than ever before. According to statistics, on March 23, 2023, the hashrate reached a high of 400 exahash per second (EH/s). The 400 exahash equates to 0.4 zettahash or four hundred quintillion hashes per second. As the hashrate continues to climb, research analyst Sam Wouters at River Financial estimates that at the current growth rate, Bitcoin could reach the zettahash era “by the end of 2025.”

With the altcoin now potentially safe from further scrutiny from the SEC, a new digital silver narrative could take shape. Here’s why.
 
Litecoin Officially Labeled A Commodity By US CFTC
 
The crypto market bled more than $50 billion in market cap today, after it was revealed that Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao will face legal action from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission “over alleged trading and derivatives rules violations.”
 
According to the filing, the CFTC has explicitly named Litecoin, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, to be a commodity under their jurisdiction. The CFTC is in charge of regulating commodity futures markets, such as oil, soy, corn, silver, and gold.

Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Sharply Gone Up Recently
 
As an analyst on Twitter pointed out, only the aftermaths of the 2021 China ban and the 2019 bear market saw more rapid increases. The “mining hashrate” is an indicator that measures the total amount of computing power that miners have connected to the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
When this metric’s value goes up, miners are bringing more machines online on the BTC network right now. Such a trend suggests the blockchain is currently attractive to mine for these chain validators.
 
On the other hand, the indicator’s value going down implies some miners are disconnecting their rigs from the network. This could be a…]]></summary>
