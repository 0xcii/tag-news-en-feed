When I started out as an entrepreneur, I never thought armed men would one day barricade themselves in my office or that my staff would resign because they feared for their lives. But that’s exactly what happened this past January when my co-founder and former COO, Artur Schaback, stormed into our Estonian office with a friend and four armed thugs to demand money.
The first thing Schaback did when he arrived at the office was to demand that our chief of information security (CISO) give company access to Schaback’s friend, a shady character recently released from prison after being convicted of violent and financial crimes, including …]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-26T16:33:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to statistics on October 26, 2023, the meme coin crypto economy has risen nearly 10% against the U.S. dollar in the past 24 hours. The top five meme tokens, including dogecoin, shiba inu, pepe, floki, and baby doge coin, have risen between 7% and more than 28% in the last day.
 
Meme Coins Enjoy a 10% Uplift in Market Value
 
Meme coin values surged against the dollar on Thursday as the market valuation of the entire meme market reached $16.8 billion, up 9.9% over the past 24 hours. The leading meme coin in terms of market capitalization, dogecoin (DOGE), has risen 11% over the past day. Right below DOGE is shiba inu (SHIB), which gained 7.8% in the 24-hour span. DOGE has recorded $1.48 billion in global trade volume over 24 hours, and SHIB has seen about $428 million in trade volume.
 
Pepe (PEPE) climbed 8.9% against the dollar, and floki (FLOKI) saw a 28.6% rise during the past 24 hours. The fifth-largest meme coin by market cap, baby doge coin (BABYDOGE), has increased by 7% in the last day. The sixth-largest meme token, literally dubbed “harrypotterobamasonic10inu,” saw a 2.2% decline on Thursday, and dogelon mars (ELON) saw a slight 1.7% increase. The token wall street memes (WSM), on the other hand, saw an 18.2% decline against the dollar.
 
 
While the meme coin economy is seeing $2.66 billion in global trade volume over 24 hours, most of the trade volume stems from DOGE and SHIB. In fact, approximately 71.42% of the day’s global trade volume derives from the two leading meme token assets. While the top five saw respectable 24-hour gains, the biggest leaders in the meme coin world in terms of today’s percentage increases include pepesol, strawberry elephant, and wassie. All three of those meme tokens saw gains between 70% and 290% over the past day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rumors of a Ripple IPO have been swirling the crypto community for quite some time now and industry leaders are beginning to join in on the conversation. The latest comments come from Lint’s Community Director Ray Fuentes, who believes an Initial Public Offering (IPO) could be on the way.
 
Ripple IPO Might Happen In 2024
 
Speaking on the Thinking Crypto podcast, Fuentes revealed that he is rather optimistic that a Ripple IPO could happen in 2024. His picking out 2024 as a possible year for the IPO has to do with the fact that he does not think market conditions are favorable in 2023. This is due to the quantitative tightening that the finance markets have experienced as a result of rising inflation.
 
 
Nevertheless, Fuentes pointed to Ripple’s offering in the space that it continues to …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was one of Thursday’s big movers, as the cryptocurrency climbed by as much as 10% in today’s session. The surge in price comes as traders look to find opportunities in riskier crypto assets, with the meme coin realm ticking this box. Shiba inu also gained, reaching its highest point in over two months. 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) rose by over 10% earlier in today’s session, as the global cryptocurrency market cap returned to the green.
 
DOGE/USD peaked at $0.07489 on Thursday, which comes following a low of $0.06596 the day before.
 
Today’s move sent dogecoin to its strongest point since August 14, when the price climbed to a high of $0.0771.
 
 
Overall, this is the seventh day in the last eight sessions that the meme coin has traded in the green.
 
This latest surge has pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) to a current reading of 80.21, above a ceiling at 76.00.
 
As a result of price being overbought, current buyers may now begin to secure their profits.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was another notable gainer on Thursday, as price rose for a second consecutive day.
 
Following a low of $0.000007429 on Wednesday, SHIB/USD rallied to an intraday high of $0.000008208 earlier today.
 
Similar to dogecoin, today’s gains have sent SHIB to its highest level since August, after the price rose by nearly 10% today.
 
 
Looking at the chart, earlier gains have somewhat faded, as a result of the RSI failing to break out of a ceiling at 70.00.
 
As of writing, price strength now sits at 69.15, with a floor at 61.00 a likely target should momentum begin to shift.

Scaramucci expressed his disappointment, describing the feeling of profound betrayal. He said during the recent World Economic Forum in Davos that he and Bankman-Fried were close and that Scaramucci considered Bankman-Fried a friend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, the analytics firm Peckshield alerted the community to another transfer of crypto assets from FTX wallets to centralized exchanges. Nearly $20 million in digital currencies were moved after the estate transferred $8.6 million in cryptocurrencies to Binance earlier in the day.
 
FTX Mobilizes Millions in Crypto to Centralized Exchanges in Second Major Move
 
The estate handling FTX’s bankruptcy has been relocating coins to centralized crypto exchanges. Following an $8.6 million transfer on Wednesday, the estate moved nearly $20 million during the evening hours of that day. The analytics and onchain intelligence company Peckshield detected the movement, with its alert system notifying the community at 10:56 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday.
 
Peckshield disclosed that about 470,000 solana (SOL), worth $15 million, were moved to centralized exchanges including Binance. The onchain analytics alert system further detailed that FTX transferred coins such as ETH, COMP, and RNDN. Further, an additional $2.5 million in ether was reportedly sent to the centralized exchange Coinbase.
 
“In addition, FTX-labeled address has transferred ~1,393 ETH (~$2.5M) to Coinbase,” the Peckshield alert added.
 
 
Observers can only speculate that the coins were sent to be sold, as their movements become opaque once held on an exchange. Besides sending crypto assets to exchanges, presumably to trade or sell them, FTX debtors have also engaged in staking assets. To date, the estate has staked millions worth of SOL and roughly $5 million worth of ether. The estate continues to work on the final proposals in the bankruptcy case, drawing closer to completion.
