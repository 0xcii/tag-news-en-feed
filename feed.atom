This decline marks the first since Sept. 19, 2023, interrupting a streak of six successive difficulty hikes. Concurrently, Bitcoin’s total hashrate has shown a downward trend over the last six days.
 
Bitcoin Hashrate Declines Amidst First Difficulty Decrease Since Early Fall
 
For the first occasion in the past six adjustments, Bitcoin’s difficulty experienced a 0.96% reduction at block height 820,512. The current difficulty stands at 67.31 trillion and will remain so for the forthcoming 12 days, until Dec. 23, 2023.

FTX Lawyers Alarm Over IRS Impact on Refunds
 
A new development to the ongoing legal battle between failed crypto exchange, FTX and the United States International Revenue Service (IRS) has put a damper on its recovery efforts. In a recent Delaware Court filing, the exchange submitted a reply to its previous motion to dismiss the IRS’s $24 billion tax claims.

The energy spent on that endeavor has now been converted into another form of energy: monetary energy. This does bring to mind the first law of thermodynamics, does it not? Now, it is clear that from the most minuscule events in our individual daily lives to the larger occurrences brought about by forces for which our physical plane of existence is their playground, the world is fraught with instability and chaos at almost every turn, exacerbated by geopolitical disparity and economic volatility on a global scale.
