        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chainlink rose by as much as 20% earlier in today’s session, as markets reacted to the release of its Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Traders were buoyed by the news, pushing the token to its highest level since April in the process. Stellar rose to a one-week high today.
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) was one of Thursday’s most notable gainers, as the token surged nearly 20% higher.
 
After falling to a low of $6.88 on Wednesday, LINK/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $8.32 earlier in the day.
 
The move pushed price to its strongest point since last April, when the token hit a high above $8.60.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the latest rally took place as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of its ceiling at 72.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is at 73.03, with an upcoming resistance point of 77.00 a possible destination for bulls.
 
In the likely event it reaches this point, LINK could surpass last Thursday’s peak.
 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
In addition to LINK, stellar (XLM) was another big mover during today’s session, as it also rose by nearly 20%
 
XLM/USD recorded a high of $0.1793 earlier in the day, which comes following yesterday’s low of $0.1414.
 
Similar to chainlink, this peak pushed stellar to its highest point since last Thursday, when the token hit a then 15-month high.
 
 
As a result of this gain, price strength in XLM is now overbought, which could spell a soon end for the current uptrend.
 
The RSI is tracking at a reading of 71.87, but is fast approaching a resistance zone at the 73.00 mark.
 
Traders may already be considering securing profits as price strength heads to this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an announcement Thursday morning, the Federal Reserve unveiled that its instant payment system, the FedNow® Service, has officially gone live. This tool aims to empower banks and credit unions of all sizes to facilitate instantaneous money transfers for their customers. The Federal Reserve claims that FedNow transactions can be executed 24/7, 365 days a year.
To start, 35 banks and credit unions, alongside the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, are among those already equipped to handle payments through the FedNow Service. Furthermore, a lineup of 16 service providers are poised to offer payment processing support for banks and credit unions.
"The Federal Reserve built the FedNow Service to help make everyday payments over the coming years faster and more convenient," said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. "Over time, as more banks choose to use this new tool, the benefits to individuals and businesses will include enabling a person to immediately receive a paycheck, or a company to instantly access funds when an invoice is paid."
When asked if the FedNow service is attempting to replace cash, and if it was a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or not, the Federal Reserve stated "No. The FedNow Service is not related to a digital currency. The FedNow Service is a payment service the Federal Reserve is making available for banks and credit unions to transfer funds for their customers. It is like other Federal Reserve payment services, such as Fedwire and FedACH. The FedNow Service is neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash."
A comprehensive list of early adopters already equipped with instant payment capabilities can be found in an attached document. Further information can be found on the Federal Reserve Financial Services website.]]></summary>

Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Has Been At Elevated Levels Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, whales have been applying a high amount of selling pressure in recent days. The indicator of relevance here is the “exchange whale ratio,” which measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 Bitcoin transactions going to exchanges, and the total exchange inflow.
 
The 10 largest transactions going to exchanges are generally coming from the whales, so the exchange whale ratio can tell us about how these transfers currently compare with the deposits being made by the entire market (the total exchange inflow).
