        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission is hogging the headlines after a report disclosed that it had attained a record crackdown on the crypto industry: Fines it imposed on crypto firms leaped to a record $4.68 billion in 2024, increasing 3018% over the previous year.
 
 
Much of this jump comes from a settlement with Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon, for selling unregistered securities and deceiving investors.
 
According to the Enforcement vs Crypto Industry Report 2024 by Social Capital Markets, these unprecedented actions by the SEC indicate a seismic shift in its approach toward policing the fast-changing digital asset market.
 
Record-Breaking Fines
 
The SEC’s 2024 fines account for 63% of the total penalties levied since 2013, bringing the cumulative total to $7.42 bil…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metaplanet, a publicly listed Japanese company, announced it had purchased 38.6 Bitcoin for 300 million yen (approx. $2.2 million), bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 398.8 BTC.

JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japanese Public company Metaplanet buys another ¥300 million worth of #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/xJmnAdDrMG
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 10, 2024
  
  
  
This latest Bitcoin acquisition comes after Metaplanet announced in August that it would raise 10.08 billion yen to purchase more Bitcoin, part of its broader corporate strategy to allocate funds to Bitcoin.
Metaplanet first adopted a pro-bitcoin investment policy earlier this year and has steadily accumulated Bitcoin. The company now holds an aggregate of 398.8 bitcoins purchased for approximately 3.75 billion yen (approximately $27.6 million).
Metaplanet's ongoing Bitcoin treasury build mimics MicroStrategy's playbook, which has raised debt to buy Bitcoin. Public companies seem to have discovered a model for acquiring Bitcoin.
Other firms following this strategy include Marathon Digital Holdings, which recently raise a $250 million via convertible note offering to buy more Bitcoin, and Semler Scientific, which similarly announced plans to raise more money to buy more Bitcoin.
Companies can capitalize on Bitcoin's appreciation potential by borrowing fiat currency at low interest rates to purchase Bitcoin. This allows public companies to gain Bitcoin exposure without liquidating existing assets.

UTXO invests in a variety of Bitcoin businesses, and maintains significant holdings in digital assets.]]></summary>

Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has taken unprecedented action against an

At the same
