Can The Dogecoin Price Reach $10
 
Dima James suggested in an X post that the Dogecoin price can reach $10 while highlighting the similarity between the meme coin’s current price action and that of the last cycle. Dogecoin’s daily chart shows that the current price action has witnessed several pullbacks toward the 0.382 Fibonacci level, just like in the previous cycle. 
 
 
 
In the last cycle, this price movement is said to have happened a few times just before a significant upward trend began. The crypto analyst revealed that the Dogecoin price is again retestin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Nigerian court has denied a bail application for Tigran  
Gambaryan, an executive at Binance Holdings Ltd., citing his trial on money  
laundering and currency manipulation allegations. 
The court ruled today (Friday) that Gambaryan's health

Court in Abuja noted that illness alone does not warrant bail unless it poses a  
threat to others.
Binance Executive's Health Concerns
Gambaryan, who is the head of financial-crime compliance at  
Binance, has been in custody since February. His lawyer, Mark Mordi, argued  
that Gambaryan needs medical treatment for a herniated disk that has severely  
affected his mobility. Gambaryan appeared in court in a wheelchair.
