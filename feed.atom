He explains that the rise of generative AI is just another way for digital companies to profit from the creative work of others without compensating or attributing them.
 
AI Companies Should Compensate Creators
 
Miller specifically calls out ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI and partly owned by Microsoft, a technology giant, as an example of a company that established a business worth $30 billion using others’ original content and creativity “without compensation and attribution.”

Blockware Solutions, a professional Bitcoin mining services company, has announced the public launch of its Blockware Marketplace. The new platform has been operating in stealth mode with only existing Blockware clients according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, and the total trading volume has already reached about $100,000, mostly within the last two weeks.
According to the announcement, the Blockware Marketplace is a product that brings transparency and "turnkey mining" to a whole new level by allowing anyone to buy an ASIC using either on-chain bitcoin or Lightning. Users can also see its historical and live hash rate before purchasing. Customers will be able to start earning bitcoin mining rewards in minutes, making it easier and more accessible for people to participate in the mining industry.
"We think this has the potential to transform the mining industry as now anyone can buy an ASIC (On-chain or Lightning), see its historical and live hashrate before purchasing, and be earning BTC mining rewards in minutes," said Joe Burnett, head analyst at Blockware. 
 
         
         
         
         
    
The Blockware Marketplace is designed to simplify the process of buying and selling ASICs, as the screenshot above shows. The simple UI shows the stats of the miners, hosting information and price in BTC. An account sign up is required to utilize the marketplace, which is open to the public starting today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano ended a two-day losing streak on Monday, as the token moved closer to a two-month high to start the week. Cryptocurrency markets were mostly lower in today’s session, with the global market cap down 0.36% as of writing. Bitcoin cash also climbed, hitting a ten-day high.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) snapped a two-day losing streak to start the week, despite the global market cap mostly consolidating on Monday.
 
Following a low of $0.3729 on Sunday, ADA/USD surged to an intraday high of $0.4035 earlier in today’s session.
 
Today’s move saw cardano near Friday’s high of $0.4093, which was its highest point since mid-February.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the climb in price coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) moving towards a ceiling of its own at 60.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 58.91, after moving away from a floor at 56.00.
 
Should price strength move past the upcoming ceiling at 60.00, then there is a strong chance ADA will recapture a fresh multi-month high.
 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was another notable gainer to start the week, as the token moved to a ten-day high.
 
BCH/USD hit a peak of $129.15 on Monday, a day after the price was trading at a low of $120.54.
 
This rally sent BCH to its strongest point since March 24, when it rose to a peak at $132.05.
 
 
Earlier gains have since slipped, as the RSI collided with a ceiling at the 51.00 mark. Currently the index is tracking at 50.59, following a rally from a support point of 47.00.
 
Overall, bitcoin cash is now up 5.78% from the same point last week.
