US SEC’s Appeal Move Receives Backlash From Stuart Alderoty
 
The prolonged legal tussle between the US SEC and Ripple over XRP saw a notable turn of events on Wednesday as the regulatory body filed for an appeal toward the court’s previous ruling that XRP does not constitute a security nature under the requirements of the current legislation.
 
 
It is worth noting that the agency’s move to file a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals comes less than 2 months after Judge Analisa Torres gave her final decision in the len…]]></summary>

Recently, a division of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a recent ruling by the lower court in favor of the telecom company and thereby allowed the case to continue in trial.
 
This ruling also brings back on track Terpin’s lawsuit against the telecom company, and consequently, underlines important issues involving the different roles of telcos in protecting customer information.
 
 
A Lengthy Legal Fight
 
It all began in 2018 when Terpin fell prey to the sophisticated SIM swap attack. Scammers bribed an AT&T employee to transfer Terpin’s number to a blank card in their phone. With access …]]></summary>
