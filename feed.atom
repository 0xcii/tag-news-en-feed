        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved  
applications from major exchanges like Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE to list  
exchange-traded funds tied to the price of ether on Thursday.  This approval potentially opens the door for  
these products to begin trading later this year.
Issuers to Seek Regulatory Approval
Nine issuers, including VanEck, ARK  
Investments/21Shares, and BlackRock, applied to launch ETFs tied to ether  
following the SEC's approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January. Despite the much-anticipated positive feedback, ether ETF issuers must obtain approval for ETF registration statements detailing investor disclosures before the products can start trading. Last-Minute Changes
Market participants were prepared for a negative  
outcome, especially considering the lack of engagement from the SEC on the  
applications, Reuters reported. However, in an unexpected turn of events, SEC  
officials on Monday requested the exchanges to make quick adjustments to the  
filings, leading to a rush within the industry to meet the new requirements in  
a short timeframe.
In the run-up to the decision-making deadline, the SEC’s Chair Gary Gensler, known for his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, declined to comment when reporters asked about the ether ETFs. The SEC spokesperson also stated that the agency would not provide  
further comments on the matter.
However, the SEC has no set timeframe for deciding on these statements, leaving industry participants uncertain about when  
trading could commence. Optimism about the SEC's approval of Ether ETF pushed the price of the  
second-largest cryptocurrency by 25% in the past week. Notably, the asset management firm plans to avoid staking  
and derivatives to address regulatory concerns. Similar activities by the SEC  
preceded the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January, which became  
a record-breaking product launch.

Ethereum To Rise To $100,000
 
In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Markus raised the possibility of Ethereum rising to $100,000, remarking that he needs the crypto token to reach this price level so he can finally purchase a house in Los Angeles. Markus’ prediction for ETH is undoubtedly one of the most ultra-bullish predictions for the crypto token and ETH reaching this price mark will be huge.
 
 
For one, Ethereum rising to $100,000 will give it a market cap of $12 trillion based on its current circulating supply. That will place the crypto tok…]]></summary>
