        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin edged marginally higher on Friday, as traders began to shift their attention to next week’s Fed meeting. Many are expecting that the Federal Reserve will keep rates unchanged for the first time in over a year. Ethereum remains above a floor at $1,830.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved marginally higher during Friday’s session, as the focus for traders begins to be next week’s Fed rate decision.
 
Following a low of $26,339.32 on Thursday, BTC/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $26,797.51 earlier today.
 
The move comes as bulls bounced from a price floor at $26,300, with a ceiling at $27,200 now a potential target.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
In order to get closer to this point, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) will need to move past a ceiling at 47.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 46.21, with bitcoin trading around the $26,600 level.
 
Despite the optimism from bulls, the 10-day (red) moving average remains in a downtrend, following a cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) recorded some small gains on Friday, after colliding with its own support point.
 
ETH/USD climbed to a peak of $1,861.14 in today’s session, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a bottom at $1,831.26.
 
Unlike bitcoin, the moving averages have yet to cross, which provides optimism to longer-term bulls of potential upcoming gains.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 
 As well as the price, the RSI has also avoided a breakout below a floor at 47.00, and is now at a reading of 48.23.
 
 
The next target appears to be the 52.00 mark, and should this be hit, ethereum will likely be above $1,900.

As James “MetaLawMan” Murphy, a renowned advisor to innovators in the metaverse and digital assets space discusses via Twitter, the stakes have gotten even higher for the SEC versus Ripple.
 
The reason is Judge Analisa Torres’ expected ruling on XRP’s secondary market transactions. If Torres rules that XRP tokens traded on secondary markets are not securities, it would undermine much of the basis for the SEC’s case against Coinbase and much of the Binance case, Murphy claims.
 
In its lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC alleges that 13 tokens traded on Co…]]></summary>
