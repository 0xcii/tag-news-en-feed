The allegation comes after an incident in which Circle took more than four months to delay its blacklisting of funds associated with the group–more than a full duration longer than that taken by other major stablecoin issuers.
 
ZachXBT used social media to vent his resentment by drawing attention to Circle’s overall platform-wide failing in their fight against money laundering.
