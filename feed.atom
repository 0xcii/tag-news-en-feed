        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below $54,000 on September 6, 2024, after cruising earlier in the day to $57,000 following the US nonfarm payrolls. The report showed that the economy added only 142,000 jobs in August, which was much below expectations and threw the crypto market into volatility.
 
 
The abrupt U-turn drove the crypto ecology into a tailspin. After striking a low of $53,780, Bitcoin lost roughly 4% in the past 24 hours and traded for $54,101. Following the dismal job count, there was conjecture on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts; estimates of a 70% probability of a 25 basis-point drop at the next FOMC meeting on September 18.

The past week was particularly drab for the two largest cryptocurrencies, as they posted double-digit losses in the last seven-day period.
 
While the BTC price performance has cooled off in the past two quarters of 2024, the flagship cryptocurrency is still outpacing Ethereum in terms of market action. Although some of this can be attributed to ETH’s own underwhelming performance in recent weeks, a blockchain analytics company has offered insight into the dynamics between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

After experiencing a 20% retrace since August 24, the price remains stable above the $0.50 mark, sparking hope among investors and analysts. This crucial support level has become a focal point, as it could indicate resilience in an otherwise bearish market. 
 
 
The stability has fueled optimism, with some analysts now targeting higher price levels for XRP in this market cycle, assuming the support continues to hold. As the broader market experiences uncertainty, Ripple’s performance at this level could determine its next major move.
