Cryptocurrencies are known for their impressive, parabolic rallies, that later causes prices to reach extreme overvaluations. When the parabola breaks down, the trend tends to reverse into a brutal bear market. Understanding when these trend changes occur is the key to being profitable in the crypto market.

Estavi had plans to sell the NFT for $48 million and donate half of the proceeds to charity. 
 
However, the NFT has since lost almost all of its value. As of July 20, the highest bid for the NFT is just $3.82, according to data from OpenSea, one of the world’s largest NFT marketplaces. Further details reveal that the highest bid received recently was $47.78.
