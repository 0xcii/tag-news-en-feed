Warren The “Biggest Threat” To Crypto In The US
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Deaton labeled Senator Elizabeth Warren as the “single biggest threat to Crypto in the United States.” He noted that Gensler can’t take these honors considering that he takes his marching orders from her. Warren, known for her firm stance on cryptocurrencies, recently reintroduced the ‘Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act.’

Bitcoin has seen a slight reversal in its ongoing rally over the last months of 2023. This price fluctuation may nevertheless suggest an upcoming bull market as the asset finds new backers.
Throughout its entire history, Bitcoin has been a wildly fluctuating asset. In the almost 15 years since the Genesis Block was mined, its greatest valuations have always come as a result of dramatic spikes, and the comedown from these highs has always been about as steep. Nevertheless, it has always shown an uncan…]]></summary>

Simply put, it's a way of doing finance using a blockchain technology system where people can interact directly without relying on traditional financial institutions.

The journey of DeFi is fascinating, reflecting how blockchain tech has matured and how people are starting to realize it can shake up regular money systems. Initially, DeFi was all about using cryptocurrencies as collateral and making decentralized apps for lending, borrowing, and trading. But now, it's breaking out of that mold.

Shiba Inu Supply On Exchanges Has Plunged Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, the Shiba Inu supply on exchanges has seen a sharp drop recently. The “supply on exchanges” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating Shiba Inu supply that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric goes down, it means that the investors are transferring a net number of coins from these platforms toward their self-custodial wallets right now.
 
 
Generally, the main reason why holders would shift their coins in this way is to hold onto them for extended periods. Naturally, thi…]]></summary>

This sentiment, expressed in a two-part interview with Finance Magnates, comes in the wake of the SEC's aggressive legal actions against key players like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, despite their notable loss against Ripple. 
Gabbay's remarks reflect the growing tension between the regulatory body and the crypto industry. He added, "What's amazing is that even though they're paying for it, they go ahead and file a complaint against Kraken, which basically shows tha…]]></summary>
