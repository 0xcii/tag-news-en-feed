        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By the time you’re reading this, Bitcoin will have closed its daily candle, leaving only 48 hours or less to defend a key level.
 
With a monthly, quarterly, and even higher timeframe close coming up in less than two days, the pressure is on for crypto bulls to fully reclaim the area.
 
The One Line In The Sand Bitcoin Bulls Must Defend
 
Every now and again, a psychological level forms that is of emotional importance to the market. A great example of this is Bitcoin at $10,000, $20,000 and now, $30,000. However, none of those are the line in the sand we are referring to.
 
 
Instead, a key technical level absolutely must be defended at all costs, or the crypto market could see another leg down. The level in question doesn’t involve complex technical signals, moving averages, or otherwise.…]]></summary>

The code has been released as the developers wish V4 to be built in public. Launched in 2018, Uniswap is one of the most known DEX for trading Ethereum and eth-based tokens.
In V2 which was released in 2020, Uniswap introduced ERC-20 trading pairs and Flash Swaps. In V3, concentrated liquidity was added to the protocol. Concentrated liquidity allows allocating liquidity to a price interval. This model improved the standard AMM model.
Liquidity providers (LPs) can execute as many positions as they wish in the pool. LPs have better control over what price ranges their funds will be used. The Uniswap V3 Business Source License (BSL) expired in April 2023.

 This, at times, has been seen as a belligerent attitude led by the SEC and aggressive enough for some crypto industry participants, including some influential figures, to speculate that it’s an orchestrated attempt to halt crypto development. In fact, this theory even has a name: Operation Choke Point 2.0 (a reference to a banking investigative operation from 2013 to 2017 by the US Department of Justice that was heavily criticized for allegedly bypassing due process.)
