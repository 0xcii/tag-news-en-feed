Crypto research firm 10x Research has provided some answers as to why institutional investors aren’t so enthusiastic about these funds.

has announced it has completed the acquisition of 100% of FTX Japan’s  
outstanding shares, making it its wholly-owned subsidiary. This subsidiary will

Bitcoin Binance Netflow Has Just Taken To Positive Values
 
In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn discussed the latest trend in the Bitcoin exchange netflow for the cryptocurrency exchange Binance.
 
 
The “exchange netflow” here refers to an on-chain metric that measures the net amount of Bitcoin entering or exiting out of the wallets attached to any given exchange. The indicator’s value is calculated by subtracting the outflows from the inflows.
 
When the metric’s value is positive, the inflows overwhelm the outflows, and a net number of tokens enter the platform. As one of the main reasons investors deposit to exch…]]></summary>

Just as the US prevailed in the space race by landing the first man on the moon, Lyman believes Bitcoin could become America’s “Trump card” in its economic rivalry with China.

These holders make up one of the two main divisions of the BTC market based on holding time, with the other cohort being known as the “short-term holders” (STHs).
