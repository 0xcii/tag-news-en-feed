Ethereum Exchange Supply Hits Lowest In 5.5 Years After $181 Million Outflow
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, ETH has just witnessed its largest exchange outflow day since August 21st. The indicator of interest here is the “supply on exchanges,” which keeps track of the total amount of Ethereum that’s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of the metric goes down, it means that a net number of coins is exiting these platforms currently. Generally, investors take their coins off these central entities toward self-custodial wallets when they plan to hold onto them for extended periods, so this …]]></summary>

We as a community would do well to remember that bitcoin stands on the shoulders of previous projects, spanning across decades of work. Satoshi built upon the technical underpinnings of said projects, their successes and failures, and each unique cultural ethos.
Taking a step back and thinking about the network, one of the great attributes of bitcoin is its deep simplicity in the monetary policy and fundamentally clear incentives across stakeholders in the network. Providing access to sound money on a trustless basis is not without risk. The game theory and incentives for miners to behave properly is one of the most sensitive components of the sys…]]></summary>

The story of Bitcoin has certainly had its fair share of nefarious characters, criminal activity, bad haircuts and worse wardrobes, and yet our anti-hero du jour has seemed to outdo them all. Sam Bankman-Fried, better known by the three letter acronym SBF, burst onto the scene at the peak of the 2017 bubble, founding Alameda Research that September, just four years after graduating from an internship into a full-time position at one of the world’s largest market makers, Jane Street Capital.
SBF is the son of Stanford Law professor and founder of left-wing super PAC Mind The Gap, Barbara Fried, and Stanford professor Joseph Bankman, an expert on tax shelter laws and government regulation. At the s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin rebounded from a three-week low on Thursday, as the cryptocurrency collided with a key support point. The move comes despite the global crypto market mostly consolidating during today’s session. Cardano was another notable mover, rallying away from a support point of its own.
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) moved away from a multi-week low in today’s session, as price climbed above the $2.00 mark.
 
Following a low of $1.95 on Wednesday, TON/USD bulls pushed the token to a peak of $2.10 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the surge, toncoin bounced from its lowest point since September 15, which has also been a key support point.
 
 
Traders opted to buy the dip at this point, with the relative strength index (RSI) rising past a ceiling of 50.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 50.73, with a ceiling of 54.00 a possible target for buyers.
 
Should this point be hit, there is a good chance that TON will hit a ceiling at the $2.20 region in the coming days.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Additionally, cardano (ADA) was a notable gainer, with the cryptocurrency climbing away from a floor of its own.
 
ADA/USD rose to a high of $0.2628 earlier in the day, which comes after a low of $0.255 the day prior.
 
Today’s move saw cardano move away from its recent support point at $0.250, just as the RSI bounced from a floor of its own.
 
 
After colliding with a floor at the 55.00 mark, price strength has gone on to reach a high peak at 58.82.
 
The next visible ceiling looks to be at the 65.00 zone, and in the event bulls manage to reach this point, ADA will likely rise above $0.270.

collapse of Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. Bankman-Fried is

The court filing, submitted yesterday (Wednesday), provided  
information about the jets. However, even though Sam Bankman-Fried supposedly  
owned them, these expensive jets were never used by him. According to a report  
from Coindesk, there are concerns about whether the aircraft was bought using

The sudden reversal of the alpha crypto’s fortunes, retreating more than 5% in the last 24 hours, has caught many overzealous traders off guard. As a result, a flurry of liquidations totaling nearly $73 million in the same timeframe has left the crypto landscape reeling.
 
The bulk of these liquidations, a staggering $61.72 million, came from the altcoin arena, where tokens like Aave, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV have taken the brunt of the collapse. Bitcoin longs contributed just $11.28 million to the overall liquidation figure, underscoring the severity of the altcoin market’s downturn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the ongoing criminal case against Sam Bankman-Fried, federal prosecutors have unveiled a forfeiture bill, indicating the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) intent to commandeer two luxury jets belonging to the ex-FTX chief. Specifically, the DOJ has its sights set on a Bombardier Global 5000 BD-700-1A11 and an Embraer Legacy 135BJ.
 
Prosecutors Set Sights on Seizing Bankman-Fried’s Luxury Aircraft
 
On the evening of October 4, the DOJ detailed its plans to seize these high-end aircraft from Bankman-Fried, co-founder and former CEO of FTX. The court order highlighted that these jets are implicated in multiple charges, specifically counts 1-4 and 7, of the federal indictment.
 
 
In addition to the Bombardier and Embraer jets, the DOJ is also keen on acquiring their associated maintenance and engine logs. This development comes on the heels of earlier reports, post-FTX’s downfall, which suggested that Bankman-Fried’s personal aircraft had made multiple trips between the Bahamas and Argentina.
 
 
Contradicting these claims, Bankman-Fried had asserted he never left the Bahamas. Adding another layer to the narrative, there were whispers that FTX’s private jets were repurposed to ferry Amazon packages to top-tier FTX personnel, given Amazon’s refusal to deliver to the Bahamas. In a related twist, Ryan Salame, FTX’s former co-CEO, reportedly had to part with his private jet as a bargaining chip in his plea negotiations.
