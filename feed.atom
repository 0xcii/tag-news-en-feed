Ethereum has already plummeted nearly 40% from its 2024 high recorded in March, and Cowen’s analysis suggests there could be more downside ahead for ETH holders. As this uncertainty looms over Ethereum’s future, investors are increasingly turning to promising alternatives like the meme coin Mpeppe (MPEPE), which has seen strong growth and is now gearing up for Tier-1 exchange listings.
