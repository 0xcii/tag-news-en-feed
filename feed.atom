The meme coin’s rally was underscored when it recently surged past the $0.12 mark, confirming a bull breakout from a multi-month downtrend. Notably, a Dogecoin analysis reported earlier by Bitcoinist revealed significant price-defining levels for the meme coin, with $0.12 being a major one.
 
 
This notable increase might just be the beginning of Dogecoin’s rally. Interestingly, this outlook is echoed by a host of crypto analysts and meme coin investors. Particularly, one popular crypto trader (Crypto Rand) emphasized that DOGE is now loading up the moonshot, a comment made to affirm the building momentum.
