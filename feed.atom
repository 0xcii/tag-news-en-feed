        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that further legitimizes Bitcoin in institutional finance, the global investment giant Franklin Templeton filed a regulatory Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, seeking approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF.
The development comes at a time when the race to launch the first US spot Bitcoin ETF is hotly contested, with entrants including incumbents like Fidelity and BlockRock, as well as upstarts like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).
Franklin Templeton, managing approximately $1.5 trillion in assets, is looking to capitalize on the growing demand for Bitcoin investments. Their proposed ETF, if approved, would provide investors with a more accessible and regulated means to gain exposure to the world's leading cryptocurrency.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-bch-6-higher-as-price-nears-200-00-level/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash was one of Tuesday’s biggest movers, as bullish sentiment returned to markets, following recent declines. After huge losses on Monday, bulls have seemingly moved to buy the dip in price, pushing the global market cap 1.55% higher as of writing. Solana also surged in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) rose by as much as 6% on Tuesday, as bulls returned to the market following recent declines in price.
 
After falling to a low of $181.38 to start the week, BCH/USD raced to a peak of $198.93 earlier in the day.
 
This rally saw bitcoin cash snap a four-day losing streak, which pushed price close to a support level at $180.00.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that this was the trigger bulls needed in order to return to the market.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also bounced at a floor of its own at the 35.00 mark, and is now tracking at 37.58.
 
Should today’s momentum extend through the rest of the week, there is a good chance that BCH will rise towards a key resistance level of $220.00.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was also in the green during today’s session, as it rebounded from a recent multi-month low.
 
SOL/USD peaked at $18.66 on Tuesday, which comes a day after the token bottomed out at $17.46.
 
Monday’s low saw solana fall to its lowest point since June 30, when price was at a low of $17.12.
 
 
Earlier gains have somewhat faded, however, as bulls were unable to penetrate the ceiling at the $19.00 mark.
 
This has led to traders opting to secure their profits, instead of keeping positions open at this point of uncertainty.

        <updated>2023-09-12T15:00:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six years ago, in a now-famous CNBC interview, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon made headlines with scathing remarks about Bitcoin, calling the digital money system that transcends international borders a "fraud" that will "eventually blow up."
In September 2017, during a conference in New York, Dimon stated that Bitcoin was only suitable for "drug dealers and murderers." He would later take back the comments in 2018 after Bitcoin passed $20,000 that year.
At the time, the Bitcoin market was still in its infancy, and many traditional financial leaders viewed it with skepticism. Dimon's comments would reverberate through the financial world, but little did he know that his words would come back to haunt him.
Fast forward six years, and the tables have turned dramatically. Bitcoin has not only survived but thrived, becoming a legitimate asset class and a household name. Its price has skyrocketed, making early investors fortunes and attracting institutional interest. Bitcoin's market capitalization has surged, and it has gained widespread acceptance as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.
In the years following Dimon's comments, Bitcoin defied all odds and surged in value, rising over 500%. Bitcoin was trading at just over $4,000 at the time of the comments, but trades routinely at above $25,000 today.
As Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo commented on X today, the comments stand in stark contrast given Wall Street's recent reversal on Bitcoin, with top firms including Blackrock and Fidelity filing for spot Bitcoin ETFs.
JP Morgan began selling Bitcoin to high net-worth clients in 2021.]]></summary>

Cardano Sidechain Midnight Is Set To Launch
 
Zero-knowledge technology, or ZK, is a cryptographic method that allows for the verification of certain information without actually revealing it. The process involves a prover, who holds a secret they wish not to disclose, and a verifier. The prover convinces the verifier of the secret’s authenticity without revealing the secret itself. The system then generates a ZK proof as validation, which the veri…]]></summary>
