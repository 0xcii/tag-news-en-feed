        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ai-focused-cryptocurrency-sector-expands-by-2-billion-in-less-than-2-weeks/"/>
        <updated>2023-11-29T15:32:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent market data reveals a significant surge in the AI-focused cryptocurrency sector, with its value ballooning by nearly $2 billion in just under two weeks. A major contributor to this growth is the token bittensor (TAO), which soared 86.5% in the last fortnight.
 
AI Crypto Economy Rebounds Strongly
 
In the AI-oriented crypto landscape, the past month has been marked by impressive growth. The top six AI tokens have all experienced double-digit percentage increases. TAO leads the pack with a striking 207% rise in the last 30 days. Following closely, fetch (FET) has climbed 46.34%, and covalent (CQT) has risen 41.91% against the U.S. dollar during the same period.
 
 
In the past month, the graph (GRT) experienced a 35% increase, while singularitynet (AGIX) witnessed a 28% uptick in its value. As of 12 days ago, on November 17, 2023, the valuation of the AI-centric crypto economy stood at $3.32 billion. This was a recovery to previous levels, achieved over three months, adding approximately $720 million from its July end low of $2.6 billion.
 
In just the last 12 days, the sector has expanded by an impressive $1.97 billion. This growth is largely attributed to TAO’s rise, escalating from a market value of $329 million on October 29 to today’s $1.297 billion. Cortex (CTXC) also emerged as a significant player in the AI-focused arena, climbing from the 17th to the 11th position in terms of market capitalization.
 
 
CTXC’s market value soared from $37 million to a current $90.62 million, following a 194.12% surge this past month. However, not all AI-centric cryptocurrencies fared well over the same period. GOC, XMON, NEURONI, ARCONA, AMC, DX, XRT, and ALI all recorded double-digit declines during the 30-day timeframe.

In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, the CEO of Geometric Energy, Samuel Reid, announced that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has approved the DOGE-1 Satellite.

assets, regulatory bodies are grappling with the challenge of overseeing crypto  
firms that are beginning to emulate traditional banking services. In a recent  
interview, Andrea Enria, chair of the supervisory board at the European Central  
Bank (ECB), emphasized the need to regulate  
crypto entities that act like banks. The looming challenge for regulators,  
according to Enria, is the deterritorialization of these entities, often  
lacking precise headquarters and operating globally.
This call for regulation comes against the backdrop of a broader  
discussion on comprehensive policies for crypto assets. The failures of the FTX

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Ripple Labs, David Schwartz, delivered a nuanced perspective on the complexities surrounding the classification of tokens as securities yesterday. Although he did not mention XRP, it seems clear that he is talking about Ripple’s battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). His analysis delves deep into the intricacies of the Howey test and its application on cryptocurrencies, like XRP.
 
Schwartz opened his post on X by stating, “I’ve talked a little bit about US securities law, and I’m going to do that a little bit more. As most of you know, the primary argument that some tokens are securities comes from the inclusion of ‘investment contracts’ in the list of things that are securities.”

This increase in price can be attributed to a number of things that have occurred over the last few days. However, the question remains of whether the DOGE price can continue this run to cross $0.09.
 
Why Is The Dogecoin Price Rising?
 
The most prominent reason behind the rise in the Dogecoin price can be traced back to general market bullishness. Despite the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delaying its decision on the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the market has been relentless and continued to push the Bitcoin price higher.
 
 
As the Bitcoin price crossed $38,000, it pulled the rest of the market with it and sent altcoins rallying. This time, DOGE saw better recovery p…]]></summary>
