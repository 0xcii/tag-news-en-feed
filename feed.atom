During a Zoom presentation, Friedberg claimed there was a conflict of interest between former and current FTX executives and FTX US’ general counsel, as Ryne Miller once worked for S&C. Judge Dorsey, however, was not swayed by Friedberg’s 17-page objection and appointed S&C, stating that “there’s no evidence of actual conflict here.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana rose by as much as 20% Saturday, as crypto markets came alive to start the weekend. The token hit a 12-week high in today’s session, breaking out of a key price ceiling in the process. Cardano also rose to its strongest point since November, with the global cryptocurrency market cap up 6.86% as of writing.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL), was one of Saturday’s notable gainers, as the token rose by as much as 20% in today’s session.
 
SOL/USD hit a high of $26.41 to start the weekend, which follows on from Friday’s low at $21.27.
 
As a result of this move, solana broke out of a key resistance level of $25.00, hitting its strongest point since November 8 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also broke out of a ceiling of its own at the 73.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 73.84, with the next visible resistance at the 81.00 zone.
 
If bulls were to collide with this wall, then it is likely that solana could move above the $30.00 point.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Another big mover on the weekend was cardano (ADA), which also moved to its strongest point since November.
 
Following a low of $0.3364 on Saturday, ADA/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.3726 earlier today.
 
This surge saw cardano jump to its strongest point in the past 12 weeks, breaking out of a resistance of $0.3650 in the process.
 
 
As can be seen on the chart, the move took price strength to a ceiling of 73.00, however, it has so far failed to overcome this hurdle.
 
Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as traders moved to secure gains, leading to ADA currently trading at $0.366.
 
Should this obstacle be eventually overcome, the next target for ADA bulls will likely be $0.40.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin surged to a five-month high to start the weekend, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. Prices of the world’s largest digital currency rose above $23,000, rebounding from a recent drop towards $20,000. Ethereum also rallied, as it hit its strongest point since September.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) raced past the $23,000 level to start the weekend, with prices climbing to a multi-month high.
 
Following a low of $20,961.21 on Friday, BTC/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $23,249.89 earlier today.
 
Today’s rally saw bitcoin jump to its highest level since August 24, when price at the time was trading at a top of $23,600.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved back towards a ceiling of 90.00.
 
Currently, the index is at the 86.30 level, with earlier gains somewhat fading, as traders move to secure profits.
 
As of writing, BTC is trading at $22,902.03, which is still roughly 9.27% higher than yesterday’s low.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Like bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also surged on Saturday, as it climbed to its highest mark in the last four months.
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,674.18 earlier in the day, which comes following a bottom of $1,550.03 on Friday.
 
As a result of the move, ethereum recaptured a high not seen since September 13, which is the last time it traded over $1,700.
 
 
Although prices are currently below this threshold, the resurgence of bullish momentum on Saturday could lead to further surges this weekend.
 
The surge has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average back into an uptrend, extending its distance from its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Overall, ethereum is up 6.28% as of writing.

According to Yahoo! Finance, Hoskinson’s reasoning as to why he has shown strong interest in buying up DCG’s media unit is that he believes journalism integrity should be restored. The Cardano co-founder’s interest was made known after CoinDesk announced its exploration of a possible sale.
 
Hoskinson disclosed in a video livestream in the U.S., last week:
 

“My interest on the media side is more broad… I would like to figure out how to get to journalistic integrity again.”

After a dismal 2022, the price of Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, has been inching upward over the past few weeks.
 
According to data from Coingecko, Bitcoin is trading at $22,709 at the time of writing, an increase of 15% over the past week.
 
However, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon remains unconvinced of the crypto’s performance. In fact, he has always been.
 
As far back September 2017, the chief executive had maintained an antagonistic stance against Bitcoin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a result of the coordinated efforts of chain developers and billionaire Elon Musk, the annual carbon emissions of Dogecoin decreased by around a quarter in 2022, making the meme token one of the quickest crypto assets at reducing carbon discharge.
 
According to a recent research by foreign currency data aggregator Forex Suggest, Dogecoin is currently the third-fastest digital asset in terms of reducing its carbon footprint, having slashed its emissions by 25% in 2022. In 2022, the blockchain emitted 1,063 tons of CO2, compared to 1,421 tons in the previous year.
 
While Ethereum saw the largest drop in CO2 emissions in 2022 after switching to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, its annual emission was 8.3 times that of Dogecoin.

The blockchain forensics firm believes that to a large extent the trend can be attributed to more of the targeted organizations refusing to pay the perpetrators.
 
Chainalysis Registers Significant Decline in Revenue From Ransomware Attacks
 
Over the course of 2022, ransomware actors have managed to extort at least $456.8 million from victims, Chainalysis revealed in a report published Thursday. The estimated amount is down from $765.6 million the year before, the analytics company pointed out, noting that the true total is likely much higher, as many crypto addresses controlled by attackers have yet to be identified.

Federal authorities have seized $150 million in assets related to FTX co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, a large chunk of which comes in the form of Robinhood stock, a court filing revealed Friday.
 
Stocks, cash, and other assets totaling almost $700 million have now been seized by U.S. officials in connection with the ongoing probe.
 
The U.S. Department of Justice disclosed the confiscation of Robinhood shares earlier this month, but on Friday it presented a more comprehensive list of sequestered assets, including cash held at several banks and assets placed at the cryptocurrency…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An Indian government official says that there is currently nothing that outlaws crypto in India “as long as you follow the legal process.” Meanwhile, the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has stressed that “cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value.”
 
Indian Government Official on Crypto
 
Indian government official Rajeev Chandrasekhar talked about cryptocurrency Thursday at an event in Bengaluru. Chandrasekhar currently serves as both India’s Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology and Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. He is also a member of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament.
 
He explained that India has no issue with cryptocurrencies if all laws are followed, Reuters reported, quoting him as saying:
 

There is nothing today that outlaws crypto as long as you follow the legal process.
 
The Indian government has not yet established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. In December last year, the government told parliament that crypto legislation “can be effective only with significant international collaboration.” Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said the government plans to discuss crypto regulations with the G20 countries.
 
However, crypto income is already taxed at 30% in India, and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) is levied on crypto transactions. Earlier this month, the government revealed that it is launching a crypto awareness campaign.
 
Meanwhile, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has recommended a complete ban on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week that “Cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value,” warning that “it will undermine the authority of the RBI and lead to the dollarization of the economy.” He even expects crypto to cause the next financial crisis if it is not banned.

The CEO of global investment bank JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, reiterated his skepticism about bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Thursday. The JPMorgan executive claimed:
 

Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud. It’s a pet rock.
 

 
Regarding the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Dimon commented: “I’m not surprised at all. I call them a decentralized Ponzi scheme. The hype around this thing has been extraordinary.”
