        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp rose higher for a third straight session on Wednesday, as prices moved to a two-week high. The rise comes despite market sentiment remaining largely bearish, with the global market cap trading 1.29% lower as of writing. Shiba inu also climbed higher in today’s session.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was once again a notable mover, as prices rose for a third straight session on Wednesday.
 
XRP/USD raced to an intraday high at $0.3952 earlier today, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $0.3729.
 
Following the rally, the token has now risen to its highest point since February 21, as it closes in on a ceiling at $0.40.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this comes as the relative strength index (RSI) of 14 days marginally broke out of a ceiling at 57.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 57.98, which is its strongest reading since the start of February.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) jumped back into the green on Wednesday, as prices reentered a key support point.
 
Following a low of $0.00001065 on Tuesday, SHIB/USD surged to a peak at $0.00001132 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw the meme coin move back above a price floor at $0.00001100, following a breakout to start the week.
 
 
Overall, it appears that this rise in price comes as the RSI moved away from a recent floor at 36.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 39.63, with a ceiling at 42.00 a possible target for bulls.
 
In order for this rally to turn from something brief into something more sustained, this ceiling will need to be broken.

BTC Seized By U.S. Government Moves To Coinbase
 
In the early hours of Wednesday, it was revealed that the U.S. government had begun moving some significant amounts of bitcoin that were seized from various criminal parties. There were around 40,000 BTC in total moved by the U.S. government, which were flagged by on-chain data aggregator Glassnode, to be internal transactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The partnership is aimed at enabling further access to bitcoin while encouraging more education.
Bitcoin technology company, River Financial Inc. has partnered with Bitcoin Magazine to provide users with the ability to sign up with River and purchase bitcoin through the Bitcoin Magazine App.
Users were already able to earn free sats by reading articles on the app, which could be deposited to a River wallet or another wallet of the user's choice through the Lightning Network. "This new partnership provides the on-ramp for millions of people to not only buy Bitcoin but actually earn it by learning," said Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey.
River CEO Alex Leishman also commented on the partnership, stating "River shares this mission and serves as a gateway for people who want to learn about and invest in Bitcoin." The integration is now live on the Bitcoin Magazine app, with BTC purchases and Lightning transfers available on River via the River app or at River.com, the release added.
The partnership between River Financial and Bitcoin Magazine is focused on educating individuals about Bitcoin and providing them with the opportunity to invest in the digital asset in a secure and efficient manner. 
“While the broader crypto industry has suffered from bad actors in recent months, there are still innovative, mission-focused companies like River and Bitcoin Magazine that are working to cultivate a more fair and just financial system,” the release noted.
The Lightning Network has been gaining traction as a fast and cheap way to transfer Bitcoin, and this partnership between River Financial and Bitcoin Magazine is another example of how it can benefit users. With the ability to earn free sats through reading articles on the app, and now the ability to easily purchase bitcoin through River, users have much easier access to opportunities to learn about and invest in bitcoin.]]></summary>

As pointed out by an analyst on Twitter, BTC exchange deposits have been heading down in recent months. There are a few relevant indicators here; the first is the “exchange withdrawals,” which measures the total number of transfers that are going out of centralized exchange wallets.
 
The second metric is the “exchange deposits,” which, as is already obvious from the name, simply tells us about the number of the opposite type of transactions that are taking place in the market.
