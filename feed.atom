Non-Custodial Mobile Wallets vs Hardware Wallets
 
Traina, a serial entrepreneur and former U.S. Ambassador to Austria, said the transformation, which he sees as being inevitable, is “definitely going to lower the entry barriers to Web3 and make it more user-friendly for everyone.” According to Traina, it was this vision for an all-encompassing Web3 wallet which motivated him to venture into the blockchain and crypto world.

However, Youssef, who was recently appointed CEO of the new peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace, told Bitcoin.com News that he is willing to accept the risks and challenges that come with leading a P2P platform because “the payoff is worth any risk.”

Bitcoin Miners Smash Records — Highest Monthly Haul of $1.51 Billion in December 2023
 

 
December 2023 has set a new benchmark for monthly revenue garnered by bitcoin (BTC) miners through block discovery and transaction verification. By Dec. 31, 2023, a total of $1.51 billion was amassed, including $324.83 million in onchain fees. This surpasses the former monthly revenue record set in May, where miners collected a total of $919.22 million, with $125.92 million from onchain fees.
 

 

 

 
In July, miners collected a total of $865 million, with $19.21 million from fees. December, however, marked a significant increase, standing 1.64 times greater than May’s record, representing a growth of 64.27% or an additional $590.78 million. At the moment, according to bitinfocharts.com, December’s onchain transaction rates are soaring, with the average fee at 231 satoshis per virtual byte (sats/vB) or $20.86 per transaction.
 

 

 

 
On Dec. 31, 2023, the median-sized fee is noted at $9.60 per transaction or 106.3 sats/vB. Moreover, on Dec. 17, 2023, fees spiked to as much as $40 per transfer, averaging around $37.43 per transaction — the year’s peak in on-chain fees, surpassing the previous high of $31 on May 8, 2023.
 

 
Also, on Dec. 17, the hash price of Bitcoin — the value of a single petahash per second (PH/s) produced daily — hit a 2023 zenith of $133.62 per PH/s, exceeding the earlier record of $125.64 per PH/s on May 8. Despite the high onchain fees, miners face a backlog of over 496,000 unconfirmed transactions and congestion of 430 blocks.
