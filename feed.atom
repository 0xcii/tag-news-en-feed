        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AntPool, a prominent Bitcoin mining pool, has made headlines by agreeing to refund an unusually high transaction fee of $3 million.
 
This decision follows the accidental payment of this fee by a Bitcoin user, setting a new record for a single transaction fee in US dollar terms.
 
A Bitcoin Anomaly And AntPool’s Response
 
The incident unfolded last week when a Bitcoin transaction included a fee of 83.65 BTC, equivalent to roughly $3.1 million, to transfer 55.77 BTC worth around $2.1 million. This extraordinary fee, amounting to over 120,528 times the usual rate, was initially frozen by AntPool’s risk control system.
