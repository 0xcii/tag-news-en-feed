        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price has risen above $35,000 for the first time since early May 2022, for which there are a number of reasons beyond mere speculation. These are the five most important reasons.
 
#1 BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Looms Large
 
The primary driver behind the surge seems to be the growing anticipation surrounding the possible green light for a Spot Bitcoin ETF. The epicenter of this surge is the potential approval of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF.
 
Fueling these speculations was a revelation from Scott Johnsson, a respected finance lawyer from Davis Polk. He noted, “So two things caught my eye from the latest iShares (Blackrock) S-1 amendment: They’ve obtained a CUSIP in preparation for a launch. They may be looking to seed with cash this month.”

Issuing panda bonds marks another step in Egypt’s attempts to move away from costly dollar denominated loans. 
 
Egypt’s Worsening Debt Affordability
 
Egypt, one of Africa’s heavily indebted countries, recently issued Chinese currency denominated bonds worth an estimated $479 million or 3.5 billion yuan. The three-year bonds, which were reportedly issued with an interest rate of 3.5%, are part of the North African country’s attempts at diversifying the country’s funding sources.

Predicting The XRP Price Rally
 
Santana first took to TradingView to share his analysis of the XRP price performance on October 13. This initial post had been made when the price of the digital asset was still trading at just $0.48, and way before the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its lawsuit against Ripple’s co-founders.

Real Volume Amid XRP Price Rally
 
In the real volume chart by Messari, an interesting pattern can be seen with the XRP price rally. For one, the real volume shows how trading volume has spiked at various price points. The most notable of these is what happens when there is an XRP price spike.
 
 
Volume tends to jump at these points suggesting that there is a high degree of interest in the altcoin. This means that as XRP tokens go on the market, there are eager investors waiting to pick up on this available supply and defend the price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin price just set a higher high above the current 2023 high and 52-week high.
 
What’s next after this as Bitcoin bulls continue to march upward?
 
Bitcoin Price Sets New 52-Week High
 
Bitcoin price is now trading above $31,800, which was the most recent 2023 high set back in July. Not only did July hold the record for the highest price in all of 2023, but it was the standing 52-week high — another important measure of an asset’s success.
 
 
A 52-week high represents one full year of trading, which is a slightly different metric than the 2023 high.
 

 
 
ETF Rumors Cause A Frenzy Of Buying
 
The sustained buying is being driven by rumors circulating that BlackRock’s spot ETF could be approved any day. 
 
 
– Rumors of SEC communicating with potential Bitcoin ETF issuers 
– Issuers update filings 
– BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation 
– Judge orders SEC to revisit Grayscale’s spot ETF filing
 
The signs are all there, it’s coming.
 
— Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) October 23, 2023
 
 
The ETF being listed by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation caused additional speculation this afternoon, propelling prices powerfully higher.  
 
High Times: What’s Next For BTCUSD? 
 
If Bitcoin can continue its rally, the next major points of resistance are locally at $36,000 per coin and higher at between $42,000 and $48,000. 
 
 
Beyond those levels, BTCUSD would be potentially revisiting all-time highs above $60,000 per coin.  Will this buying activity keep up and turn into an impulse that takes BTC to new all-time highs?]]></summary>

Bitcoin Could Get Impulsive If 2023 High Is Broken
 
Bitcoin price is back above $31,000 after spending more than a year in the $20,000 range. A higher high above the current 2023 record – which is less than $1,000 away at this point – could send the top cryptocurrency into overdrive.
 
If price action marches higher from here, there’s a strong chance that BTCUSD has entered what’s called an impulse phase. An impulse phase is the most bullish (or bearish) point of any trend, just before things begin to accelerate.
