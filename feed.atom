        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Switzerland’s announcement at the Sibos 2023 conference in Toronto about live transactions with a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) taking place by the end of the year, the XRP community is currently shrouded in a web of claims, counter-claims, and expert explanations.
 
A community member, known by the handle @Rohitku24694375, delivered a striking assertion via X (formerly Twitter), claiming that the Swiss Central Bank is leveraging XRP as a settlement token through the R3 network.
 
The user purportedly discovered a screenshot of the code which he believes reveals the usage of the token in the Swiss CBDC’s financial machinations, stating unequivocally: “Swiss Central Bank uses R3 Corda DLT for CBDC + R3 Corda settlement code with XRP.”
