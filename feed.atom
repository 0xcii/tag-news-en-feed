        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New York Attorney General Letitia James has initiated a lawsuit  
against prominent cryptocurrency companies, including Gemini Trust Company  
(Gemini), Genesis Global Capital, LLC, and Digital Currency Group, Inc. (DCG),  
alleging a fraudulent scheme that cost over 230,000 investors more than $1  
billion. 
This groundbreaking case reveals a web of deceit where  
Gemini misled investors about the safety of its partnership with Genesis, while  
Genesis and DCG attempted to conceal staggering losses, ultimately leading to  
substantial financial harm for thousands of investors. 
Gemini, a New York-based digital asset platform, launched  
its Gemini Earn program in collaboration with Genesis in February 2021,  
promising a secure investment opportunity. The program aimed to generate  
profits for investors by lending assets to third parties and returning a  
portion of those profits. Investors were repeatedly assured that their money  
was safe, but the Attorney General's investigation uncovered a starkly  
different reality.

In his latest YouTube video, Pizzino delves into the intricacies of Bitcoin’s four-year cycle and shares his belief that the digital currency is unlikely to revisit its previous cycle lows. This analysis is based on historical data that reveals a compelling pattern in Bitcoin’s price movements.
 
One of the key factors driving Pizzino’s outlook is Bitcoin’s four-year cycle, a well-documented phenomenon in the world of cryptocurrency. This cycle refers to the period between each Bitcoin halving event, which occurs approximately every four years.
