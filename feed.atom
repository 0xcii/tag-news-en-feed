        <updated>2023-03-27T15:32:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp moved back towards a five-month high on Monday, as prices surged for a third straight session. The token formerly known as ripple was one of the very few gainers to start the week, as markets mostly consolidated. Polygon edged closer to a multi-week low to start the week.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, rose for a third consecutive session on Monday, as prices neared a five-month high.
 
Following a low of 0.4438 on Sunday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4877 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, XRP moved closer to a recent high of $0.4940, which is the strongest point the token has hit since November 6.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this latest rally comes as the relative strength index (RSI) moved towards a ceiling at 70.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 66.91, and should it pass the 70.00 mark, then XRP will likely hit a fresh multi-month high.
 
A long-term ceiling at the $0.5000 mark could potentially be a target for current bulls in the market.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC), moved lower to start the week, with the token falling towards a recent support point.
 
MATIC/USD fell to a bottom at $1.08, which comes a day after prices were trading at a high of $1.12.
 
Overall, polygon is now on the brink of colliding with the $1.05 floor, which was last hit on March 12.
 
 
From the chart, it looks like a downward cross has taken place between the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
In addition to this, the RSI is now tracking at 43.62, which is marginally above a resistance level of 43.00.
 
Should momentum continue to fall, there is a strong possibility that MATIC will move below $1.00.

Bitcoin Miners Have Spent Almost Equal Number Of Days In Profit As They Have In Loss
 
According to a new report published by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, BTC miners have been enjoying profits recently. To know whether Bitcoin miners are making profits or losses, the difference between their revenue and expenses is taken.
 
The firm defines the “mining revenue” as the sum of the total value of coins that miners are issuing (that is, the BTC they are getting through mining block rewards) and the transaction fees that they are receiving for handling transfers.

Kwon, who has been on the run from South Korean authorities, is now set to appeal his detention after the Montenegrin court ruled to extend it by 30 days.
 
Do Kwon might also face judgment in the US over the collapse of LUNA and UST algorithmic stablecoin collapse that caused a $40 billion loss in crypto. But, the time of his extradition from Montenegro remains uncertain.

As Bitcoiners, we often repeat the mantra “Bitcoin fixes this” and truly, it does solve many problems.

Margot Paez is a brilliant environmentalist and an outspoken Bitcoiner. Paez received master’s degrees in physics and ethnomusicology and is currently finishing a PhD in civil engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
