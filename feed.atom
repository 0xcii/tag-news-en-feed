        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After obtaining a comprehensive capital markets license in Singapore, Hashkey Group announced it has successfully garnered $100 million through a Series A funding round. The fresh injection of capital is earmarked for expediting the growth of their licensed operations in Hong Kong, while simultaneously strengthening the company’s Web3 initiatives.
 
$100 Million Funding Aims to Fuel Expansion and Strengthen Web3 Initiatives
 
On Tuesday, Hashkey Group, based in Hong Kong, disclosed its successful fundraising of $100 million from a mix of strategic partners, institutional backers, and Web3 entities. This infusion of funds elevates the company to unicorn status, with an estimated valuation of approximately $1.2 billion.
 
In their Tuesday announcement sent to Bitcoin.com News, the company elaborated, “The newly raised capital will be used to solidify Hashkey’s Web3 ecosystem, accelerate the product diversification of its licensed business in Hong Kong, and drive the Group’s compliant and innovative development globally.”
 
 
The latest development comes on the heels of Hashkey securing a comprehensive Capital Markets Services (CMS) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Hashkey Exchange, the firm’s trading platform, boasts over 155,000 registered users and a trading volume of $630 million in the past month. On Tuesday, the group further highlighted its establishment of partnerships with six publicly traded companies and ten brokerage houses.
 
According to Crunchbase, Hashkey has executed 85 distinct investments, channeling funds into startups like Fetcch and Range Protocol. Notably, Hashkey recently spearheaded a $5 million pre-Series A funding round for 0xscope, with contributions also coming from GSR Markets, Redpoint China, Amber Group, and Okx Ventures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Market insights reveal that on Jan. 15, 2024, the stablecoin TUSD deviated from its usual $1 parity, dipping to $0.979 per coin the next day. By 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Tuesday, it managed to recover slightly, climbing above the $0.99 mark.
 
TUSD Faces Unsteady Ground, Drops Under $1
 
Recently, TUSD experienced fluctuations, slipping below its $1 benchmark on Monday. That evening, its value lingered around $0.98, amid challenges linked to the company’s real-time attestations. As of Jan. 16, 2024, TUSD’s circulating supply, as displayed on their website, stands at 1.92 billion tokens.
 

 
A significant portion of TUSD’s supply is in the hands of Binance, which owns the top five ERC20 wallets. Of the total supply, only 391.99 million TUSD tokens are issued on the Ethereum blockchain, while 1.48 billion are on the Tron network. Binance’s cold wallet holds approximately 1.4 billion of these tokens.
 
At 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, TUSD temporarily reached $0.996 per coin. Yet, by 10:20 a.m., it fell to about $0.987. This instability has sparked considerable debate on social media, with many questioning the reasons behind TUSD’s fluctuating peg. Most of the trading activity for the coin is concentrated on Binance, with a significant portion of its volume originating from this exchange.
 
 
In the last 24 hours, TUSD’s global trade volume hit $425 million. Despite a hefty supply of 1.92 billion TUSD, its market valuation on Tuesday was slightly lower, at $1.89 billion. TUSD is now among several stablecoins that have dealt with parity issues, a trend that began with the Terra blockchain ecosystem’s collapse in May 2022.

As ESMA gears up for the implementation of the MiCA  
regulation, the regulator has established a comprehensive plan to tackle  
crypto-related risks and establish a regulatory framework for the digital asset  
space. However, the watchdog has warned that the MiCA regulation is not a

MiCA, effective from June 2023, brings with it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fourth Bitcoin halving is almost upon us, and this one has the potential for some very interesting surprises. This halving marks the reduction of the Bitcoin supply subsidy from 6.25 BTC every block to 3.125 BTC per block. These supply reductions occur every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, as part of Bitcoin’s gradual, disinflationary approach to its final capped supply in circulation. 
The finite supply of 21 million coins is a, if not the, foundational characteristic of Bitcoin. This predictability of supply and inflation rate has been at the heart of what has driven demand and belief in bitcoin as a superior form of money. The regular supply halving is the mechanism by which that finite supply is ultimately enacted.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, exchange deposits and withdrawals on the Bitcoin blockchain have recently continued to increase.
 
The relevant indicator here is the “Exchange Flow Volume,” which keeps track of the combined amount of volume flowing into the wallets of all centralized exchanges (that is, the inflows) and that moving out of these platforms (the outflows).

guidelines on money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risk factors  
to crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). This initiative is significant in the EU's ongoing battle against illicit financial  
activities. As crypto-assets become increasingly susceptible to misuse for  
criminal purposes, the EBA's guidelines aim to equip CASPs with the knowledge  
and tools to identify and effectively mitigate these risks.
The EBA's guidelines shed light on the risks CASPs face, emphasizing factors such as the rapid crypto-asset transfers  
and features that conceal user identities. These risks necessitate a  
comprehensive understanding, prompting the EBA to provide a list  
of factors indicating exposure levels to ML and TF risks.
