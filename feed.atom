Sunday night marks another significant event after a ‘sleeping bitcoin’ whale from 2017 stirred, spending an impressive 1,177.89 BTC — worth more than $30 million — from seven distinct bitcoin addresses, untouched for just over six years.
 
1,177 Bitcoin From 2017 Move for the First Time in Over 6 Years
 
As bitcoin (BTC) dances around the $26K mark, several once-dormant bitcoin wallets are springing to life after years of inactivity. On Sunday, during block heights 805,096 and 805,100, about seven distinct BTC addresses roused from a six-year hibernation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin hovered below $26,000 on Monday, as traders awaited a big week of economic announcements in the United States. The consumer confidence report will be released on Tuesday, with gross domestic product and nonfarm payrolls coming in the upcoming days. Ethereum was largely unchanged today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin started the week hovering around the $26,000 region, as markets prepared for a big week of economic data.
 
Following a high of $26,406.15 on Sunday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,914.93 earlier in today’s session.
 
The world’s largest cryptocurrency has mostly consolidated around this level for the past ten days, since surging above $30,000 earlier in the month.

Since then a huge red wave has swept through the market, with BTC falling to a two-month low just over a week ago.
 
Prices have continued to trend sideways as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has failed to break out of a resistance level of 30.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 27.34.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also consolidated on Monday, with prices largely unchanged from Sunday’s low.
 
ETH/USD climbed to a high of $1,665.14 earlier in the day, which followed on from Sunday’s bottom of $1,641.63.
 
The move saw ethereum once again climb above a support point of $1,650, following a recent drop below this zone.

Similar to bitcoin, the RSI has been unable to move past a ceiling of 33.00, which seems to be the main barrier to a bullish resurgence.
 
In the event this level is breached in the coming days, ethereum will most likely move above $1,700.

Of all countries on Earth, the formerly-named Yugoslavia best reflects all of the prime examples of what Bitcoin “fixes.”
I was born there — grew up, started school and even had my first job there before moving abroad. Now, I have realized that my experiences in Yugoslavia from childhood to adulthood formed my views of the world, its geo-political powers, the value of money or lack thereof, economics and corruption. The events in Lebanon over the last number of years, with the collapse of the economy, are similar to the things that I experienced in the former Yugoslavia decades earlier.

What Is Cointime Economics For Bitcoin Value?
 
According to the whitepaper, this economic model is meant to be a new way of representing Bitcoin’s tokenomics based on the tokens in circulation. It is expected that the Cointime Economics will complement the traditional Unspent Transaction Output (UXTO) model. 
 
 
The UXTO model provides data on the amount of Bitcoin remaining in each address after any transaction. However, unlike the UXTO model, which “may be prone to inaccuracies,” Glassnode and Ark Invest note that Cointime Economics provides a “highly consistent” framework that better h…]]></summary>

The growth momentum of its native ARB token holders seems to have hit a roadblock, igniting apprehensions about the token’s value and the overall vitality of its ecosystem.
 
Data from Token Terminal shows ARB’s 24-hour, weekly and monthly timeframes in the red, and with a market cap shedding 18%. Its daily active users also show a nearly 10% decline in the last 30 days. 
 
 
The rather stagnant ARB token holder count has the potential to cast a shadow on the token’s intrinsic value and could even impede the expansion of its once-flourishing ecosystem.
