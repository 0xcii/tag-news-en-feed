However, a recent report from China’s People’s Court challenges this historical stance, offering newfound recognition to virtual assets as legal property.
 
In a significant departure from conventional policy, the report titled “Identification of the Property Attributes of Virtual Currency and Disposal of Property Involved in the Case” asserts that virtual assets possess economic attributes that categorize them as property.

This comes as the SEC looks to dispute Ripple’s partial victory after Judge Annalisa Torres ruled – in July – that XRP doesn’t classify as a security when sold to retail investors. 
 
In its interlocutory appeal, the commission stated that an appeal was merited “because they involved controlling questions of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin was easily one of the biggest movers in crypto markets to start the weekend, as price rose by over 10%. Saturday’s surge comes despite the global market cap mostly trending lower, having fallen by 0.43% as of writing. XRP was one of the tokens to fall, dropping below a key price floor.
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was a notable mover in today’s session, as the token rose by as much as 10% on Saturday.
 
After a low of $1.74 on Friday, TON/USD surged to an intraday peak of $1.95 to start the weekend.
 
As a result of the move, toncoin climbed to its strongest point since May 24, which was the last time price traded above $2.00.
 
 
Today’s rally comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rebounded at a floor of 75.00, following a surge above 83.00.
 
Price strength is deeply overbought, however this has not stopped bulls from continuing to send TON even higher.
 
This could be a recipe for a bear trap however, with a change in direction almost certainly on the cards in the not too distant future.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was in the red to start the weekend, as the token marginally dropped below a key support point.
 
XRP/USD fell to a bottom at $0.4886 on Saturday, which comes following a peak at $0.5081 the day prior.
 
This downturn comes as bears pushed price below a price floor of $0.5100 earlier in the week, with momentum continuing to slip since then.
 
 
Ever since the ripple ruling, which saw XRP price spike to an almost two-year high, the token has mostly moved lower.
 
The RSI is now tracking around a floor of 29.00, which is in the midst of a bear zone. However, should this level hold firm, there could be a reversal next week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MakerDAO Co-founder Rune Christensen has suggested the DeFi project utilize a fork of Solana’s codebase to build its proposed “NewChain.”
 
Back in May, the MakerDAO announced its “Endgame” network update aimed at improving the protocol’s “efficiency, resilience and participation” via the formation of a “strong governance equilibrium.” 
 
The “NewChain” is a vital part of the Endgame’s fifth and final phase, in which the MakerDAO protocol will be fully rebuilt on its own new, native layer-one blockchain. 
 
Christensen has described this final phase as a long-term project set to run for over three years. However, in easing the team’s effort, the MakerDAO Co-founder believes they can explore the fork of existing open-source blockchain rather than building a new protocol from scratch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the weekend trading below the $26,000 level, as bears seized market momentum to end the week. Price surged during the early part of the week, climbing over the $28,000 mark. However in the days that followed, sentiment has mostly trended lower. Ethereum remains in the red.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin continued to trend lower on Saturday, as the bears were once again in control of crypto market sentiment.
 
Following a high of $28,148 on Tuesday, BTC/USD started the weekend falling to a low of $25,362.61.
 
The decline has come as a result of profit taking, and also the changing economic climate in the United States.
 
 
Consumer spending is slowing, whilst the labor market remains tight as a result of increasing interest rates.
 
Looking at the chart, today’s decline pushed bitcoin below a key support point of $25,600, however bulls have since reentered.
 
At the time of writing, BTC is now trading at $25,818.66, with a target of $26,000 likely to be present throughout the weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
After almost falling below $1,600 on Friday, ethereum (ETH) was mostly higher to start the weekend’s session.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,650.71 earlier in the day, but momentum has since dropped, with the price now at $1,635.02.
 
The world’s second largest cryptocurrency has not been able to move back above $1,650, which has been a point of price support.
 
 
From the chart it appears that ETH managed to avoid dropping under $1,600 due to the relative strength index (RSI) colliding with a floor at 36.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 37.04, with the next visible ceiling at 49.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Colorado Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has announced it accepts cryptocurrency for its online services via the payment processor Paypal. Besides paying local taxes with coins, residents of the crypto-friendly state will be able to use their digital cash to renew driver’s licenses and plates.
 
Colorado Introduces Online Payments With Crypto at the DMV
 
People in Colorado who use the online services of the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, like renewing a driver’s license or vehicle registration, can now pay with cryptocurrency through the popular payment platform Paypal, the Denver 7 TV channel reported.
 
Those who chose to pay with crypto will be directed to Paypal, where they can select the digital currency they want to use which will then be converted to U.S. dollars and eventually transferred to the department, DMV officials explained.
 
 
“At the DMV, we’re always looking for ways to better serve Coloradans and leverage technology to offer our services,” Senior Director Electra Bustle emphasized in a statement quoted on Thursday. The executive further elaborated:
 

This new online cryptocurrency payment option is yet another way the DMV is providing innovative and convenient service delivery to our customers.
 
A service fee of $1 plus 1.83% of the DMV total will be applicable to payments made with cryptocurrencies, the department noted. The DMV is currently accepting crypto transactions only through Paypal which can apply its own fees.
 
Colorado has been open towards cryptocurrency adoption. Under Governor Jared Polis, it started accepting crypto as payment of state taxes and fees in the summer of 2020. The Colorado Digital Token Act, which allows certain cryptocurrencies to have securities exemptions, was passed the previous year.
