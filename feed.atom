76.2% Of Bitcoin Supply Now Locked In Diamond Hand Holdings
 
In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards talked about the trend in the supply of BTC long-term holders. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to the investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago.
 
Generally, the longer a holder keeps their coins dormant, the less likely they become to move these coins at any point. Because of this reason, the LTH group includes the investors with the strongest resolve.
 
 
Historically, the LTHs have kept quiet regardless of what’s going on in the wider market, as they don’t easily get enticed by profit-taking …]]></summary>

You can say that the value proposition is built on the foundations of the ever-expanding benefits of the wonder-currency. 
After my failed attempt to first invest in Bitcoin in early 2010, I found myself traveling and working in the Middle East, and Egypt in particular, later that year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana snapped a two-day losing streak on Thursday, as bulls pushed price back towards the $25.00 level. The cryptocurrency was unable to move past this level on Monday, which then prompted the aforementioned sell-off. Cosmos continued to edge lower today, falling to its lowest level in 16 months.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was a big mover in today’s session, after rebounding from two days of consecutive declines.
 
SOL/USD rose to a high at $24.40 on Thursday, which comes a day after the price fell to a bottom of $23.26.
 
As a result of today’s surge, the world’s seventh largest cryptocurrency climbed closer to a long-term ceiling at $25.00.
 
 
The token failed to break out of this level to start the week, which then resulted in the sell-off seen on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
In order to truly move beyond this wall, solana traders will first need to add some distance from a current ceiling of 65.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 65.06, however bulls may be tentative to enter, until the index moves closer to 66.00, 67.00.
 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
