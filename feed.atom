This move follows the successful launch of PYUSD on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and its subsequent addition to PayPal’s Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payments service. According to Bloomberg, the decision to join Solana was driven by the blockchain’s speed and low transaction fees. 
 
Expanding PYUSD’s Reach In The Memecoin Market
 
Solana’s transaction processing capabilities, currently measuring 1,423 transactions per second (tps) according to SolanaFM, attracted PayPal to the blockchain. In comparison, Ethereum processes around 12 to 15 tps.
