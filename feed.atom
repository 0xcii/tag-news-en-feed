        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRESS RELEASE. The Seasonal Tokens economy has gone through its second change of season. Like bitcoin, the four tokens – Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter – go through regular halvings of the supply from mining. Every nine months, the rate of production of one of the tokens is cut in half. On the 6th of March, the Summer halving took place. Summer went from being produced at the fastest rate of the four tokens, to the slowest.
 
As the market adjusts to the lower rate of supply after a halving, the token that was previously the cheapest gradually becomes the most expensive. This happened with Spring after its halving in June of last year. The same process is now unfolding with Summer. Autumn tokens, which are now produced at the fastest rate of the four, have become the cheapest token, and…]]></summary>

And according to an analysis by attorney Jeremy Hogan, who has been following the case with video updates since the beginning, the odds of a Ripple victory are good if Judge Torres understands the technology.
 
As the attorney notes, however, a Ripple victory is by no means a no-brainer, especially since the case represents the entire crypto industry’s biggest battle against the SEC. “This is a nuanced legal battle on which the future of “crypto” as we know it may hinge,” Hogan states.

What Are ‘Bank Walks’?
 
Bank walks, so called by analysts due to their slow action when compared to bank runs, are slow movements of deposits caused by the constant search for higher yields. According to an ongoing study titled “Destabilizing Digital Bank Walks,” they “cannot be stopped by any deposit insurance and that will undermine the stability of the banking system in the months to come.”

What users were less prepared for was that when they opened the app on Monday, its familiar blue bird logo would have been replaced with an image of a dog, or, more specifically, replaced with the Dogecoin logo.
