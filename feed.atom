Economist and “Currency Wars” author Jim Rickards has warned that despite China and other nations intensifying their efforts to reduce their dependency on the U.S. dollar, the USD’s biggest threat comes from the Treasury. He stressed on “Fox & Friends Weekend” Saturday:

The Fed has responded to recent criticism of the Fednow service and asserts that the Fednow payment network is “neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash.”
 
Fednow Won’t Replace Cash, the U.S. Central Bank Insists
 
When the U.S. Federal Reserve announced the launch of the Fednow service in July, it sparked immediate opposition and led many to believe it is one of the initial stages of an American central bank digital currency (CBDC).

This is an opinion editorial by Milan Stanojevic, an elementary school teacher and filmmaker.
Since the end of the second world war, the United States has consistently been the dominant global superpower. The Soviet Union vied for superiority during the Cold War but ultimately failed as it lost control of its satellite states. This was evident when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. 
In recent years, American hegemony has been challenged by China, a nation which has accumulated tremendous wealth since opening up its economy to the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP has experienced over 15% price retracement after initially hitting a whooping 10-month high over the last week. The past week has seen the sixth-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization rise to over $0.58. The last time this digital asset touched this mark was May 2022. However, the coin has since entered a retracement losing over 14% in 7 days. 
 
According to a chart by TradingView, the coin currently plateaus at around $0.51, where it has been for the past two days. 
 
 
Is This A Mere Correction Or Downtrend?
 
With such a significant downturn, Ripple has left many investors wondering if the coin is still in an uptrend or a complete trend reversal. However, recent happenings in the XRP ecosystem suggest that this is nothing to be worried about.

Turley’s reputation took a major hit after these damaging claims quickly became viral on social media.
 

“It was a surprise to me since I have never gone to Alaska with students, The Post never published such an article, and I have never been accused of sexual harassment or assault by anyone,” he said.

To stop the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury from threatening the financial system with the CBDC, the document said the U.S. Congress “should explicitly prohibit” its issuance.
 
CBDCs a Threat to Financial Privacy
 
A policy analysis document released on April 4 by the CATO Institute warns that a central bank digital currency could be detrimental to the American people. To support this assertion, the analysis document points to the two-thirds of the 2,052 comment letters sent to the U.S. Federal Reserve that oppose plans to launch a CBDC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looksrare, the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, has launched version two, also known as v2, which reduces protocol fees by 75%. According to statistics from Dune Analytics, Looksrare was the tenth-largest NFT marketplace in terms of trader count during the past week.
 
NFT Market Protocol Looksrare Launches v2
 
NFT marketplace Looksrare announced the launch of version two (v2) on April 6, 2023. One of the significant changes is the reduction of Looksrare’s fees by 75% with v2. “Looksrare’s protocol fee is now a fixed 0.5%, down from 2%,” the team noted in a blog post. “Given the current market meta, we’re removing creator rebates for the time being.”
 
According to stats from Dune Analytics, Blur and Opensea traders dominate the market in terms of traders and market share in volume this week. Looksrare is the tenth-largest NFT marketplace in terms of traders and volume this week, according to metrics from Dune Analytics and Dappradar.
 
Looksrare claims that users can save “~50% on gas fees compared to other marketplaces like Blur, and ~30% on gas fees compared to Looksrare version one.” In addition, Looksrare v2 will use ethereum (ETH) instead of wrapped ethereum (WETH). With Looksrare v2, users can make bulk purchases by adding “70+ NFTs to your cart.”
 
 
Moreover, Looksrare announced that version one (v1) will be deprecated and provided a timeline for the process. “As of 7 p.m. (UTC) on April 12, you’ll no longer be able to POST v1 orders via the public API,” Looksrare said. Looksrare v1 will be completely sunsetted by April 13, and all operations will be migrated to v2. Looksrare also shared the new public API endpoints for v2 in the same blog post.
 
What do you think of Looksrare’s decision to deprecate version one and migrate all operations to version two? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.]]></summary>
