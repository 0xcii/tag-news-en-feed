Frustrated with the conventional financial system and seeking candidates to push their interest in digital finance solutions and digital currencies, Gen Z and Millennials today account for 40% of the vote, according a recent Coinbase survey.
 
 
With 25% of voters between the ages of 18 and 34 owning crypto, compared to just 14% of older Americans, it would seem that this demographic isn’t just tech-savvy but politically engaged, too.

JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japanese public company Metaplanet buys another ¥500 million worth of #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/utiXEwsymM
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 20, 2024
  
  
  
Metaplanet bought 57.273 bitcoins at an average price of ¥8.73 million per bitcoin. This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 360.368 bitcoins acquired for ¥3.45 billion ($25.6 million).
Metaplanet first announced plans to raise ¥10.08 billion through a public offering to fund Bitcoin purchases on August 6. A week later, it secured a ¥1 billion loan to buy Bitcoin, which it has now used to purchase over 100 Bitcoin so far.
The Japanese firm is aggressively expanding its Bitcoin reserves by borrowing capital at low interest rates. This mimics the "buy Bitcoin strategy" of MicroStrategy, which since 2020 has sold debt and equity to amass over 226,500 Bitcoin treasury.
Other public Bitcoin buyers raising capital recently include Marathon Digital Holdings, which sold $300 million of convertible notes to buy Bitcoin. Semler Scientific also issued equity and debt partly to purchase Bitcoin.
Metaplanet's series of loans and stock offerings to fund Bitcoin buys illustrates how public companies are utilizing markets to stack sats. With Bitcoin gaining mainstream adoption, firms are treating it as a treasury reserve asset.

Gensler has had no shortage of critics since being confirmed to the helm of the SEC. One of his most vocal critics is Republican Tom Emmer, a representative of Minnesota. He questions whether Gensler has done anything positive through the “lawsuit-heavy approach.”
