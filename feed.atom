The NFT, technically a digital certificate of ownership, was purchased by Sina Estavi, the CEO of Malaysia-based cryptocurrency company Bridge Oracle. Estavi had plans to sell the NFT for $48 million and donate half of the proceeds to charity. 
 
However, the NFT has since lost almost all of its value. As of July 20, the highest bid for the NFT is just $3.82, according to data from OpenSea, one of the world’s largest NFT marketplaces. Further details reveal that the highest bid received recently was $47.78.
