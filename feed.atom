Although U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles, overseeing Voyager’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, has approved Binance.US’s acquisition of Voyager, the country’s regulators oppose the sale. 
 
According to the report, other elements of the deal could go through, but not the legal protections provided in Voyager’s Chapter 11 filing. In addition, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles, has agreed to hold a hearing on Wednesday to decide whether to halt Voyager’s indemnification provisions.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, an additional 20% of the adjusted supply is now enjoying profits. The relevant indicator here is the “percent supply in profit.” As its name already implies, it measures the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply currently holding unrealized gains.
 
The metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in the circulating supply to check what price it was last moved at. If this previous value for any coin was less than the latest Bitcoin price, then that coin is counted under the supply in profit.

According to Ultrasoundmoney, ETH supply deflation has recently hit a record high as the total ETH supply has dropped by nearly 1% in the past 30 days.
 
This drop in supply comes at a time when the ETH price has dipped in recent weeks and is currently showing a bullish trend. Over the past three days, ETH has surged by nearly 10% after surviving major losses from last week.
