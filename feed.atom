Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) raced higher on Tuesday, as the meme coin broke out of a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $0.08578 to start the week, DOGE/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.095 earlier today.
 
As a result of the surge, dogecoin rose to its strongest point since December 11, when prices were at a high of $0.0972.
 
 
Since the move, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a ceiling of its own.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 65.03, which is marginally above a resistance level at 65.00.
 
Providing bulls are able to maintain current momentum, their next target will likely be $0.099.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Another notable mover was shiba inu (SHIB), which rebounded following losses to start the week.
 
SHIB/USD rose to a high of $0.00001195 in today’s session, which comes a day after the token was at a low of $0.00001134.
 
Tuesday’s surge saw SHIB climb back above a key support level of $0.00001165, and came as the RSI also rebounded.
 
 
As of writing, the index is currently tracking at 62.57, which is marginally above a floor at 60.00.
 
Should momentum continue to move higher, the next target for shiba inu bulls will likely be a ceiling at 68.00
 
Providing this mark is hit, it is a strong possibility that SHIB/USD will be trading above $0.00001220.

Some notable events include the collapse of Terra and its ecosystem, the implosion of the FTX exchange, and the spreading of contagions that followed them.
 
However, early 2023 brought a new dawn in the industry. Most crypto tokens rose in value, with Bitcoin closing the market at $23K from January 25 till the 30th. 
 
 
But amid the price recovery, the tension of the 2022 bear market is still lingering. As a result, some employees in the industry are losing their jobs. According to a recent report, almost 3,000 crypto employees lost their jobs in January 2023.

Labor is what takes a harsh, brutist and difficult world and turns it into a livable, enjoyable and even meaningful place. Work is how we contribute to our civilization, our communities and, of course, our families. Work in a normal, functioning market provides value.

Bitcoin Demand Possibly Slowing Down As Netflows Become Neutral
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, only around $20 million in net outflows are taking place in the BTC market right now. There are three relevant indicators here: the exchange inflow, the outflow, and the netflow.
 
The exchange inflow measures the total amount of Bitcoin being deposited to centralized exchanges, while the outflow keeps track of just the opposite: the number of coins leaving exchanges.
 
The “exchange netflow” is simply calculated by taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows. Naturally, the significance of the metric’s value is that it’s the n…]]></summary>
