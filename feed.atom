On the back of this poor performance, other altcoins have been creeping up in their market cap to challenge Dogecoin’s position in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap list. And now, after another week of stalling behind the market, Dogecoin has lost its position on this list.
 
Dogecoin Loses 10th Spot To Tron (TRX)
 
Justin Sun’s Tron and its native TRX token have been on a bullish run over the last year. It has risen almost 200% from its 2023 lows of $0.05, and this has sent its market cap rocking. At the same time, the Dogecoin price has failed to follow this growth path, and has instead stalled.

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Dipped Into Red Territory
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, selling pressure on Coinbase has risen recently. The indicator of interest here is the “Coinbase Premium Index,” which measures the percentage difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance.
 
When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is greater than that on Binance right now. Such a trend implies either the buying pressure on the former is higher than the latter or the selling pressure is lower.
 
 
On the other hand, a negative value implies Coinbase may …]]></summary>

This was pointed out by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who identified multiple patterns similar to what was seen in 2020 that could result in a parabolic rally.
 
Dogecoin Chart Looks Similar To 2020
 
2020 was a pivotal year for Dogecoin as it was the setup that led to one of the most impressive rallies in crypto history. It also shares a similarity with 2024 as it was also a year when the Bitcoin halving took place, leading to an incredibly bullish one year for the space.

Spurred by an ongoing lawsuit in the U.K., the new emails are the most significant addition to the canon of what we know about Bitcoin's still anonymous creator. 
Here are the most important new findings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every four years, the Bitcoin halving occurs, meaning that the amount of new coins issued through mining rewards is cut in half. When Bitcoin first launched, mining rewards were 50 BTC. Currently, that figure is 6.25 BTC, and after the next halving, it will be reduced to 3.125 BTC.
 The halving occurs every 210,000 blocks rather than on pre-specified dates, but this corresponds to a roughly four-year cycle, which means that the next reduction in issuance should reach us this April. Notably, a glance at BTC’s price action since inception reveals a repeating pattern of vertical gains, deep corrections, and drawn-out recoveries, and this sequence appears to correspond closely with the halvings, leading among bitcoin traders to an entrenched belief in halving-driven movements.

The legal saga, which saw the NYAG accusing Genesis and its collaborators of defrauding investors for over $3 billion, took an unexpected turn when DCG filed a court objection to the settlement.
 
Violation Of Bankruptcy Code? 
 
DCG’s objection, outlined in a recent court filing issued on Wednesday, revolves around the belief that the proposed settlement allows the Debtors (Genesis) to redistribute value from lower classes to preferred creditors, thereby violating the absolute priority rule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today at 11:30a in Waco, Texas, the Texas Blockchain Council and Riot Platforms, Inc., asked a Federal District Judge Alan Albright for a temporary restraining order blocking the Energy Information Administration from enforcing their "emergency" survey.
At that hearing, the attorneys for the Government offered a voluntary declaration by EIA Administrator DeCarolis, offering a four-week pause on enforcement and collection. Judge Albright, recognizing that the Government's offer here was little more than an empty promise without some sort of enforcement mechanism, directed the Government to work with the Plaintiffs to craft a negotiated order that would fully bind the Government to:

Take down the survey for the agreed four-week period;
Provide notice that anyone who hasn't yet complied, that they don't need to comply right now; and
Provide an affirmation that any information which has been received so far, or which is received in the interim, shall be sequestered and not utilized by the Agency.

Also, this order will be National in scope, so every miner in the US is covered.
If the Government can't reach an agreement by 3pm Central today, the Judge indicated that he would issue a Temporary Restraining Order with the same effect as the above, but would accelerate the timetable to the permanent injunction hearing.
We'll know more in a few hours when the final order is entered, but it looks like for now at least, the EIA has been stalled in their (allegedly illegal) "emergency" data collection.
Here is a link to the case files.
