        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies have been on significant price increases in the past few weeks. Bitcoin, in particular, has been inching close to its all-time high, and the recent break above $68,000 puts it only 8% away from setting a new price record. 
 
 
Interestingly, this inflow into Bitcoin has seen the cryptocurrency increase its dominance over altcoins. According to data, Bitcoin’s market dominance is now 65% of the total market cap, the highest in three years. This raises the question of whether the altcoin season will still materialize in the current market cycle.

As Bitcoin continues its erratic price action, even briefly hitting over $70k last March 2024, the question remains as relevant as ever. So, is Bitcoin a better store of value and hedge against inflation?
 
 
If we ask the experts, many agree that Bitcoin is far better than the US dollar and other fiat currencies. According to Anthony Pompliano of Professional Capital Management, Bitcoin is better since fiat currencies are more volatile, and it simplifies many investing principles.

After weeks of bullish price action, the market is closely watching for confirmation of a breakout from the seven-month accumulation pattern that has built up significant momentum.
 
Top analyst Daan recently shared his insights, stating that this breakout is now a reality, fueling optimism among investors.
 
 
As Bitcoin continues its climb, many anticipate a small retrace, followed by a strong bounce that could pave the way to challenge the all-time highs around $73,000. The key level to watch remains $69,000, and if BTC can maintain its strength above this price, a surge to new highs seems increasingly likely.

Specifically, the NYSE received the green light to list and trade options for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC (BTC), and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB).
