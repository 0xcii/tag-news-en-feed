Former Ohio Representative Tim Ryan has observed this growing trend, which is reshaping the party’s stance on digital currencies and their regulation.
 
 
SEC’s Skepticism And Congressional Responsibility
 
Gary Gensler, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appointed by US President Joe Biden, has been a vocal critic of cryptocurrency. He strongly opposed the FIT21 bill after it passed in the House, reflecting his cautious stance on crypto regulation. Industry lobbyists argue that Gensler’s influence has swayed many Democratic lawmakers, who often rely on party-appointed regulators for expertise on complex financial issues.

Some view it as a currency for everyday transactions, others as a modern equivalent of gold for storing value, and yet others as a decentralized global platform for securing and validating off-chain transactions. While these views all hold some truth, Bitcoin is increasingly establishing itself as a digital base money.
Functioning akin to physical gold as a bearer asset, inflation hedge, and providing currency denominations like the dollar, Bitcoin is reshaping the concept of monetary base assets. Its transparent algorithm and fixed supply of 21 million units ensure a non-discretionary monetary policy.

BREAKING: 🇺🇸 MICROSTRATEGY TO RAISE $500 MILLION IN STOCK SALE TO BUY MORE #BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/ALsb7znGEZ
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 13, 2024
  
  
  
MicroStrategy is already the largest public company holder of Bitcoin, with over 214,400 BTC worth $15 billion on its balance sheet. Starting in 2020, under Saylor's direction, it adopted Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset.
It's average purchase price per Bitcoin remains around $35,000. With Bitcoin trading near $68,000, the firm is still significantly in the green on its holdings.
The latest $500 million capital raise comes via selling convertible senior notes to qualified institutional buyers. The notes will pay interest semiannually and mature in 2032 unless converted or redeemed earlier.
According to the announcement, MicroStrategy may use the funds for general corporate purposes, but Bitcoin acquisition remains the priority. The company will also grant initial purchasers an option to buy an additional $75 million of notes.
MicroStrategy's Bitcoin-buying obsession has made it a Wall Street proxy for Bitcoin itself. The company's stock often rises and falls with Bitcoin's price movements, with investors betting on BTC's upside.
With this latest capital injection, MicroStrategy is signaling its conviction that Bitcoin will continue appreciating over the long term. Saylor is ready to double down by acquiring more coins while prices remain relatively low.]]></summary>

Sources claim Biden's team is discussing accepting crypto donations via Coinbase Commerce. The payment service enables contributions to Trump's campaign.
The Biden campaign's outreach is reportedly an effort to appeal to Bitcoin and crypto-focused voters ahead of the hotly contested 2024 election. 
However, the news sparked a backlash from some industry figures. Critics argued it was hypocritical given the Biden administration's hostile stance toward the industry, including a recent veto of bipartisan crypto legislation.
Sources say Biden's team wants to signal a friendlier posture on Bitcoin and crypto. With the election expected to come down to razor-thin margins, Bitcoin and crypto voters could prove decisive. 
Billionaire Mark Cuban suggested Biden's indifference to crypto could hand Trump the presidency. Recent polls give Trump a double-digit lead among crypto holders.
The Biden campaign did not officially confirm the reports on potential crypto donations. Sources stressed talks are still exploratory as Biden gauges the Bitcoin and crypto landscape.
The engagement nonetheless shows Bitcoin's growing influence. Both parties realize appeasing Bitcoin supporters is now necessary, even if symbolic. With potential voters and donors at stake, expect more Bitcoin pandering as November nears.]]></summary>

In this study, we reveal that it is not only feasible but economically viable and environmentally beneficial to use landfill gas (LFG) for digital asset compute (e.g., Bitcoin mining). To support this theory, Marathon partnered with Nodal Power to harness excess capacity from their project, which is exclusively powered by landfill methane gas. This partnership, leveraging Nodal’s patented technology, successfully utilized methane from a landfill, converted it into electricity, and used it to power the on-site data center. This process proved to be consistently reliable, with high uptime and emerged financially beneficial for Marathon and Nodal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Civkit, a project attempting to revitalize the global peer-to-peer economy, announced the release of its first alpha version following over a year of dedicated development. The protocol aims to enable peer-to-peer trading in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need for a centralized order book. The design is architected around Nostr and Lightning, with a reputation system at its core.
A team of anonymous developers, led by Nicholas Gregory (Commerceblock, MercuryLayer), has been working behind the scenes to bring this vision to life. "The project is funded by people in the global south. Much of the work has involved understanding their actual needs rather than imposing our assumptions," says Gregory. "Ray Youseff and Noones have provided funding for some developers, including one who lives in the global south, allowing us to test in regions where this solution is most needed."
The Civkit Node provides a UI to create P2P trade orders. You can use this to create buy/sell orders for peer-to-peer trades, pay the hold invoices, chat with the trading partner, confirm fiat received to release payment, raise disputes (in the chat app), and view other trade orders. 
Using a custom Nostr event type, CivKit allows orders to be shared among Nostr relays accepting these types to create a global orderbook. The escrow system returns BOLT11 invoices, locking 5% of the trade amount in a hold invoice which is released upon trade completion. A URL is provided to access the encrypted chat, which includes basic dispute features. 
The team expects the alpha version of the Civkit reputation system to be released in two weeks. Following this, the focus will shift to federating the order book and escrow with Fedimint, and subsequently incorporating eCash support.
"This is a very ambitious project with a long way to go, but it's exciting to see our first tangible results," Gregory adds.]]></summary>
