If this breakout were to play out as the analyst predicts, then the Dogecoin price could be looking at a brand-new all-time high in the next year.
 
Bitcoin Breaking Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern
 
In the analysis posted on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, the pseudonymous crypto analyst who goes by the name Trader Tardigrade on the social media platform, pointed out that the Dogecoin price has been in a Falling Wedge. This Falling Wedge has persisted as the price had succumbed to bearish pressure which eventually saw it fall below $0.1.
 
 
However, the bullish part about Falling Wedge patterns like the one observed on the Dogecoin chart is when the price…]]></summary>

Following the US District Court for the Southern District of New York’s final judgment on August 7, 2024, the SEC now has less than a week to decide whether to challenge the ruling regarding Ripple’s XRP token sales. The SEC only has until October 7 to appeal the final ruling in the Ripple case.
 
Will The XRP Lawsuit Go In Overtime?
 
Rispoli voiced his predictions this weekend on X, stating, “I’m 60/40 rn in favor of seeing an SEC notice of appeal but the stakes are really high for the SEC. Letting it slide (no appeal) means that ‘programmatic sales’ is a one-off loss that literally only appl…]]></summary>
