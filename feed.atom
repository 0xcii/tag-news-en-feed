When asked by crypto enthusiast David Hoffman, Buterin conveyed his dissatisfaction with individuals who solely perceive tokenization as the primary breakthrough in cryptocurrencies. 
 
While acknowledging that tokenization has facilitated the emergence of fresh economic models and democratized the accessibility to financial instruments, Buterin seems to argue that such a narrow perspective undermines the wider scope of the technology’s potential. 
 
Can we truly appreciate the profound impact of cryptocurrencies if we limit their significance to just tokenization?
