Bitcoin Miners Reducing Their Dumping
 
While BTC is under pressure, sliding nearly 10% from September highs, it is emerging that Bitcoin miners have been slowing down their liquidation activities. In a post on X, one analyst observes that over the past few weeks, top Bitcoin miners have been gradually reducing coin transfers to top centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.

Following the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut announcement, Bitcoin’s price surged aggressively but is now retesting key demand levels, likely determining its next target.
 
 
According to data from Glassnode, there has been a clear improvement in Short-Term Holder profitability throughout the recent rally. This has relieved investors who bought BTC during the price run-up, as many are now back in profit. Despite this positive data, uncertainty lingers in the market, with concerns of a deeper correction.
 
The short-term outlook remains uncertain as traders closely watch whether BTC can hold this crucial level or if further downside pressure will prevail.

Bitcoin Has Plunged As Short-Term Holders Have Been Realizing Gains
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the short-term holders have started taking profits again recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Realized Profit/Loss Ratio,” which, as its name implies, tells us about how the profit and the loss volumes being moved by Bitcoin investors currently compare.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average holder on the network is moving their coins at a net profit. On the other hand, the indicator being under this threshold suggests loss-taking is the dominant form of selling in the market.
