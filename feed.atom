Over the last few weeks, I’ve noticed a disappointing trend that has divided the Bitcoin community into two warring factions. On one side, the “Bitcoin transaction maximalists” believe that Bitcoin Layer 1 should be used purely to process transactions. On the other side of the spectrum, the “Ordinal enjoooyers” want to use Bitcoin’s Layer 1 to inscribe arbitrary data and generally want to experiment with the base layer.
I personally don’t have a dog in this fight. I think both sides make compelling arguments for their use cases. The purpose of this article isn’t to say one is right and the other side is wrong, it is to raise the alarm about what happ…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Australia’s largest and oldest crypto exchanges, Independent Reserve, is accelerating its expansion plans in South East Asia while exploring the Hong Kong market. The crypto exchange is looking to open new offices in more friendly jurisdictions in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong to strengthen its Asian footprint.
 
The exchange received a Major Payment Institution Licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in October 2021 to operate as a regulated digital payment token service provider. However, in an interview, Independent Reserve’s Singapore CEO, Lasanka Perera, said the ban on public crypto advertising caused a 90% drop in the exchange’s customer acquisition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated Monday, after recovering recent losses over the weekend, setting the stage for a potential rally this coming week. Price traded close to a one-week high on Monday, marginally below a key resistance level. Ethereum also rebounded, and is now hovering near a support point of its own.
 
Bitcoin
 
After dropping to a three-month low last week, bitcoin (BTC) has since rebounded, trading close to a one-week high on Monday while seeing consolidation.
 
BTC/USD hit an intraday peak of $26,675.93 to start the week, which is its strongest point since June 11.
 
The move pushed price close to a key resistance level of $26,800, which is typically the last line of defense before heading to $27,000.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
In order to move beyond this point, a breakout will also need to occur on the relative strength index (RSI), in particular at a ceiling of 50.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 48.87, as traders begin to prepare for the potential of a break.
 
Should this occur, traders will likely be targeting the $27,300 level.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) started the week above $1,700, less than a week after almost falling below the $1,600 mark.
 
Following a low of $1,721.28 on Sunday, ETH/USD hit an intraday high of $1,746.51 earlier today.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency remains close to a one-week high of its own at $1,769.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that ethereum’s RSI is at a reading of 41.48, which is marginally below a ceiling of 42.00.
 
Should this point of resistance be broken, it is likely that bulls could make another run towards the $1,800 region.
