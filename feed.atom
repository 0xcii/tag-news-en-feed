In his article arguing against the support for ‘pro-crypto’ politicians, Vitalik noted that crypto is more than just money and that the crypto community shouldn’t be rallying behind a politician because they support people’s rights to hold and spend these tokens. He gave a rundown of why crypto was created in the first place to show that these politicians may not necessarily be in support of the main ideologies behind the crypto industry.
