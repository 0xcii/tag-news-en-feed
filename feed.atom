This report brings into focus the increasingly complex nature of tax treatment in relation to these digital assets, as cryptocurrencies straddle the dual roles of investments and currencies.

According to reports, Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley has downgraded Coinbase because of its ongoing legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the continued vagueness around US regulation of cryptocurrencies.

On May 25, Binance initially suspended the deposit of 10 Multichain-bridged tokens due to days-long delays in transaction time on the Multichain protocol.
 
A few days later, the debacle worsened when Multichain announced it could not contact its CEO Zhaojun.
 
As a result of its CEO being inaccessible, the team behind Multichain stated they couldn’t obtain the necessary server keys for the maintenance of some nodes, which affected the cross-chain operations of various networks, including ONUS, Omax, Findora, etc.
