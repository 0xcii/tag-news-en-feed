        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tether has frozen $28 million worth of USDT tokens connected to the Huione Group business in Cambodia. This is a big deal in the world of cryptocurrencies. This move comes after claims of theft and money laundering, showing how hard it is to regulate digital currencies.
 
 
Tether And The ‘Pig Butchering’ Trap 
 
Elliptic, a company that studies blockchains, says that Huione Group has been involved in “pig-butchering” scams. This is a type of scam in which scammers get people to trust them before getting them to invest in fake schemes. People say that the company is involved in illegal deals worth about $11 billion and mostly uses Tether’s USDT stablecoin to do business through Telegram.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The price of Bitcoin surged past $63,000 after an assassination attempt on former U.S. President Donald Trump during a campaign rally.
Bitcoin jumped nearly 10% from below $58,000 on Friday to over $63,000 on Monday morning. The sharp move higher came after a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.
While Trump survived with minor injuries, analysts linked the rising price of Bitcoin to improved odds of a Trump election victory in November. Trump has embraced Bitcoin and crypto and pledged to roll back regulation, making him the preferred candidate for many Bitcoin advocates.
Moreover, Doland Trump Team has also confirmed that he will still attend the Bitcoin 2024 conference in person in Nashville in two weeks. This further validates his commitment towards the Bitcoin.
Exchanges saw heavy trading volume as bitcoin broke above its 200-day moving average. Some analysts view sustaining this technical level as a bullish signal after weeks of downward pressure.
The gains add to Bitcoin's recovery from lows near $53,000 earlier this month when sell-offs from the Mt. Gox payouts and the German government spooked markets. Traders are hoping this bounce marks a definitive bottom.
Bitcoin is regaining its footing above $60,000 after a brutal few weeks. If the breakout rally continues, Bitcoin may yet return to all-time highs in anticipation of a Trump presidency.]]></summary>
