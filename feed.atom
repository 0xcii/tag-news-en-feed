One of the most notable changes in this hard fork, as DaVinci articulated in a Discord update, is the enhancement of the token-burning mechanism. DaVinci stated, “We are undergoing a swift hard fork at Bor Block- 1962000 to enhance our burning mechanism, enabling support for multiple burn tokens, namely BONE and SHIB.”

This makes them “more accessible for developers and projects to use,” Fernandez added.
 
Zero-Knowledge Versus Optimistic Rollups
 
In his written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News via Telegram, Fernandez argued that by offering what he called “a seamless experience” ZK-RaaS can also quicken the “implementation of secure and scalable networks.” While ZK-RaaS are believed to be more secure, Optimistic Rollups-as-a-Service, on the other hand,…]]></summary>
