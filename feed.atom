In a recent interview, Draper claimed the world’s most famous cryptocurrency could soar to a mind-boggling $10 million, fueled by widespread adoption and a weakening US dollar.
 
 
“Now, $250,000 or a million, or $2 million, or even $10 million are the numbers that are probably going to happen,” Draper said.

Cardano Could Soon Experience A 75% Price Rally
 
Martinez mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Cardano could see “another impressive rebound” with its Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) dipping below -22%. He had noted that ADA’s price rose by over 75% the last time the MVRV ratio dipped below -22%. From Cardano’s current price level, a rally of over 75% will take it above the $1 price mark.

The Bitcoin halving (also called “the halvening”) is programmed to happen every 210,000 blocks – approximately every four years.
 
With miners set to receive 50% fewer BTC, the rate of Bitcoin creation will also be slowed down. Miners will now produce 450 BTC per day compared to a daily production average of 900 BTC prior to the halving.
 
The previous three halvings occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020, significantly reducing mining rewards over the last decade. In 2012, the first halving event saw the reward for mining a block drop from 50 to 25 BTC.
