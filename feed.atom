While the SEC currently has several applications for spot Ethereum ETFs under review, the situation for XRP ETFs is notably different, with no applications filed to date.
 
However, the landscape could change rapidly, according to Steven McClurg, Chief Investment Officer at Valkyrie Investments. Valkyrie Invest is currently one of 11 applicants awaiting approval of its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF.

The “preliminary investigation” of X further found that the SEC account “did not have two-factor authentication enabled at the time the account was compromised.” This raised massive security concerns on the part of the regulator.
