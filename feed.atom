        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) has increased its investment in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a new SEC filing today, as first reported on X by MacroScope. 

In an SEC filing today, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board reported owning 2,898,051 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust as of June 30 (valued at $98.9 million as of that date).
This is an increase from the 2,450,400 shares that Wisconsin previously reported in May.…

As of June 30, the board owns 2,898,051 shares, valued at $98.9 million. This marks a substantial increase of 447,651 shares from the 2,450,400 shares reported in May. Notably, the filing also revealed that the board no longer holds any position in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a change from May when it reported holding 1,013,000 shares. 
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
Earlier this year in May, SWIB became the first state pension to buy spot Bitcoin ETFs, signaling a another big milestone in the integration of Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios. The board's decision to increase its investment in IBIT highlights a growing preference for direct Bitcoin exposure through spot ETFs, reflecting broader institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. 
Despite the recent downward price action in Bitcoin, money continues to pour into the spot Bitcoin ETFs, with a total combined inflow of $243.06 million since July 24.

Usually, the higher their reserves, the higher the chances that these miners will begin selling in a bid to secure profits. However, once the reserves plummet, it not only signals an end to the sell-offs but also means fewer coins left for the miners to sell if they continue to keep selling. This time around, the Bitcoin miner reserves have fallen to January 2021 levels, which could have some positive implications for the market.

In a recent interview, he urged Harris to be clear about her stance on digital assets, insinuating that perhaps she is soon going to join the pro-crypto bandwagon.
 
This prediction comes at a time when the political climate surrounding cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly complex, with various factions within both major parties holding differing views.
 
 
The political landscape for cryptocurrencies is growing increasingly complicated—with wing groups in both major parties holding deeply opposing views—and this prediction comes as that complexity is getting deeper.
