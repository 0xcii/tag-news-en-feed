        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent statement, former President Donald Trump made it clear that, if elected for a second term, he would not reappoint Jerome Powell as the Federal Reserve Chair. Trump has expressed his dissatisfaction with the current Fed Chair's performance, and suggests that Powell will rate cuts in attempt to give Democrats an advantage in the 2024 elections.



Trump's criticism comes amidst concerns over inflation and the Federal Reserve's handling of monetary policy. The former President believes that Powell's approach has been too "political" and not been in the best interest of the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve plays a crucial role in shaping economic policies and managing interest rates, impacting everything from employment to inflation.
"No, I wouldn't do that," Trump stated when asked if he would reappoint Jerome Powell. “I think he’s going to do something to help the Democrats, if he lowers interest rates,” Trump continued. The former president then went on to mention that he has a "couple choices" of who he would replace Powell with, but declined to reveal exactly who.
The announcement adds an interesting dimension to the political and economic landscape, setting the stage for potential changes in leadership at the Federal Reserve if Trump were to secure a second term. Powell has faced challenges since being appointed for his second term as Fed Chair by current U.S. President Joe Biden, including navigating the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.
As political dynamics continue to evolve, Trump's stance on Powell and the Federal Reserve will continue to be focal point of discussion, considering the critical role the institution plays in shaping the nation's economic trajectory. Investors, policymakers, and the public will keenly watch how this declaration influences economic narratives and potential shifts in leadership within the Federal Reserve.]]></summary>

On Sunday, February 4, El Salvador’s presidential election will determine whether Nayib Bukele and his revolutionary experiment with Bitcoin will have a continued presence in the nation’s future.
Since Nayib Bukele became President of El Salvador in 2019, he has enjoyed a fairly broad base of support; he was the first man since 1984 to win independently of the nation’s two major political parties.
