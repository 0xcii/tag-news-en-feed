        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The actions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continue to raise eyebrows among crypto industry observers. According to John Deaton, a pro-XRP lawyer, the regulatory body’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation appears to uphold the interests of corporate capitalism rather than advocating for investor protection.
 
Deaton, a seasoned legal professional who has been actively involved in numerous crypto-related cases, argues that the SEC’s recent dealings with leading crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase reflect this sentiment. His claims lend weight to the growing discourse surrounding the regulatory body’s role in shaping the future of the rapidly evolving digital asset space.

Scheduled to take place in the coming week, the Litecoin halving has garnered significant attention throughout 2023, with many investors and enthusiasts eagerly preparing for the potential impact it may have on the price of LTC.
 
The Litecoin halving event, a crucial network occurrence, will witness a reduction in mining rewards by half. Currently set at 12.5 LTC, the rewards paid out to Litecoin miners will be slashed to 6.25 LTC, signaling a transition to increased scarcity for the popular cryptocurrency.
