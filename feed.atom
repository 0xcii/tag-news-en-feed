Ripple’s chief counsel, James K. Filan, and Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal already called the SEC’s bluff. In their view, the rigid standards for an interlocutory appeal still need to be met. These mid-case appeals only proceed if waiting for a final verdict would cause “irreparable harm.” According to Filan, the agency has yet to prove this harm exists.
