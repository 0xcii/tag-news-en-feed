The hacker demands a Bitcoin (BTC) payment to prevent the public from leaking sensitive information. The security breach seems to be part of a larger attack on a cloud database.
 
 
Student Data At Risk of Being Leaked
 
On Tuesday, two educational institutions from the US received a warning that sensitive information had been hacked. A hacker known as Sp1d3r announced that the data of over 4 million US students was at risk of being publicly leaked.
 
The hacker claims to have stolen the information from Los Alamos Public Schools, and Edgenuity, an online learning platform. Seemingly, the information was taken from Edgenuity and LASchools.net’s Snowflake accounts.

Particularly, the ETC Group’s latest research highlights these funds’ significant decrease in Bitcoin holdings, marking a strategic shift that could have broader implications for the cryptocurrency market.
 
 
Towel Thrown For Bitcoin
 
André Dragosch, Head of Research at ETC Group, points out that crypto hedge funds have dramatically scaled back their BTC exposure. Over the past 20 trading days, exposure has fallen to a mere 0.37, the lowest since October 2020, Dragosch revealed.
 
 
This reduction reflects a cautious or bearish sentiment towards Bitcoin within the professional investment community amid the asset’s current struggle to rally.

Dogecoin Whales Have Notably Reduced Their Supply In The Last Year
 
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, DOGE whales have lost supply share to other holder groups recently. The “whales” here refer to the Dogecoin addresses carrying at least 1% of the entire circulating supply of the memecoin in their balance.
 
These humongous holders are considered the most influential on the network due to the massive scale of tokens they control. Their collective behavior can be worth keeping an eye on, as even if it may not directly impact the price, it can tell us about the sentiment among this cohort.

The incident unfolded after the exchange received a bug report through its bug bounty program on June 9 from a self-described security researcher who claimed to have discovered an “extremely critical” bug that allowed him to “artificially inflate” his balance on the platform. 
 
However, the situation took an unexpected turn when it was discovered that the researcher and their associates had exploited the flaw to withdraw a substantial sum. Kraken has launched a criminal investigation into the matter and is coordinating with law enforcement agencies to address the incident.
