As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, whale activity on exchanges has been dropping recently. The “exchange whale ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top ten Bitcoin transactions going to exchanges and the total exchange inflows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinfinity, an Austrian bitcoin broker, has recently integrated the Lightning Network into its services, allowing customers to make bitcoin purchases with reduced transaction fees and quicker processing times.
Thomas Burgstaller, Chief Growth Officer at Coinfinity, highlighted the significance of this integration, stating, "Being this early to market is an important innovation step for us at Coinfinity, and Lightning itself is an essential foundation for the global adoption of Bitcoin as a usable monetary system."
 
         
         
         
         
    
The Lightning network, a Layer 2 scaling solution, addresses the limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain by facilitating faster and more cost-effective transactions for smaller bitcoin amounts. By leveraging the Lightning network, Coinfinity aims to enhance Bitcoin's usability as a competitive payment system, surpassing the transaction volumes of major card networks such as VISA or Mastercard.
Customers of Coinfinity can gradually access Lightning features through the company's web portal and mobile app for iOS and Android — currently, users can utilize Lightning to buy bitcoin, after which it will be integrated into the savings plan feature and then the selling function. 
This integration not only offers convenience to users but also contributes to the wider adoption of Bitcoin as a viable means of payment. The move comes as Coinfinity seeks to optimize transaction efficiency and reduce costs associated with traditional bitcoin transactions. 
For further details on Coinfinity's Lightning network integration, interested individuals can read a blog post on the company’s website.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pouch has unveiled its latest app feature, “Send Globally,” aimed at simplifying money transfers from the Philippines to U.S. banks. The feature allows Pouch customers, including expats residing in the Philippines, to send Philippine pesos that will be paid out as U.S. dollars to recipients' U.S. bank accounts.
Ethan Rose, CEO of Pouch, emphasized the company's commitment to enhancing cross-border payments and promoting financial inclusivity, stating, "Enabling Send Globally for Pouch customers is a part of this. With Send Globally, there is no need to go to a physical bank branch to send from the Philippines to US bank accounts. Pouch.ph is accessible to Filipinos from all backgrounds."
The “Send Globally” feature offered by Pouch aims to provide users with fast and cost-effective transactions, with a reduced processing time of zero to three days compared to traditional methods that could take weeks. Additionally, the press release stated that the feature eliminates the risk of payment delays caused by intermediaries and offers competitive rates to enhance affordability for both businesses and individual users.
By leveraging the Bitcoin Lightning Network, Pouch said it aims to facilitate quick and inexpensive transactions, allowing users to send money with ease. Rose highlighted the significance of this collaboration, stating, "This collaboration represents a significant milestone in our mission to provide seamless, affordable, and secure cross-border payment solutions to Filipinos."
To access the feature, users can download the latest version of the Pouch.ph app, available on Google Play and the Apple Store. Pouch said it plans to expand into more markets and establish partnerships with international entities to further enhance payment services worldwide.]]></summary>
