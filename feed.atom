        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The X (Twitter) account of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm focused on cryptocurrencies, was hijacked by scammers aiming to entice users with a fraudulent token claim scheme.
 
On August 9, several messages emerged from Blockchain Capital’s account, promoting a giveaway of tokens called “BCAP.” These messages guided users to a fraudulent website that imitated the legitimate appearance of the actual Blockchain Capital company’s site.
 
The attacker’s website connected to the Blockchain Capital X account was deliberately crafted with a URL closely resembling the authentic one, achieved by adding an additional “n.” This malicious site then directed users to link their cryptocurrency wallets as per its instructions.

According to a recently filed class-action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, 18 VC firms have been named as defendants for allegedly aiding and abetting FTX’s fraud.
 
Inadvertently Helping FTX To Steal Customer’s Funds
 
FTX was once one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, but it collapsed in a spectacular fashion that sent ripples across the whole industry.

In a submission to a federal court in New York, Musk’s legal team formally requested the elimination of the plaintiff’s revised complaint. 
 
Echoing this motion, Alex Shapiro, the attorney representing Elon Musk, vehemently criticized the most recent complaint put forth by the Dogecoin investors, characterizing it as a case in point of “abusive and belligerent litigation tactics” employed by the opposing side.
 
 
 
“Enough is enough,” Shapiro wrote. “This action is yet another example of counsel’s abusive and belligerent litigation tactics.”
