        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite efforts to combat cybercrimes and theft in the crypto industry, a recent study by Chainalysis has revealed a significant resurgence of ransomware in 2023. 
 
Payments exceeding $1 billion were recorded, marking a substantial increase in the scope and complexity of attacks. This represents a major reversal from the decline observed in 2022, indicating that ransomware remains an escalating problem.
 
Ransomware Landscape Evolving? 
 
The study highlights that the ransomware landscape is continuously evolving, with increased threat actors and the complexity of attacks. 
 
According to the blockchain analysis firm, one contributing factor to the surge in ransomware attacks is the growth of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), which has lowered the barrier to launching such attacks. This has…]]></summary>

The Bitcoin Mining Event In Focus
 
Taking to X, Ted believes BTC prices will float higher after Bitcoin halves in April 2024. This event, set at the protocol level and scheduled roughly every four years (or after 240,000 blocks), will significantly reduce the amount of coins entering the market. 
 
 
The reduction in this supply will make BTC deflationary, possibly increasing prices. This outlook is considering the expected demand that will continue to rise in 2024.
 
The Bitcoin network disburses 6.25 BTC roughly every 10 minutes, meaning 900 BTC is mined daily. After halving, that number will drop to 450 BT…]]></summary>

In a new post on X, CryptoQuant CEO and founder Ki Young Ju has talked about how the US-based Bitcoin miners are behaving so far in the leadup to the upcoming halving.
 
The “halving” here refers to a periodic event for Bitcoin in which the cryptocurrency’s block rewards are permanently slashed in half. This event occurs every four years; the next one is estimated to happen this April.
 
 
The block rewards are the BTC rewards miners receive as compensation for adding blocks to the network. Since these rewards usually make up for most of the miners’ revenue (as the transaction fees have…]]></summary>
