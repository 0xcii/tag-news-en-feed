Three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the commingling happened almost daily in accounts the exchange held at U.S. lender Silvergate Bank, with sums running into billions of dollars. While Reuters couldn’t independently verify the figures or frequency, the news agency reviewed a bank record showing that on Feb. 10, 2021, Binance mixed $20 million from a corporate account with $15 million from an account that received customer money.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant move to combat money laundering and enhance the transparency of crypto transactions, Japan has announced the enforcement of stricter anti-money laundering measures starting from June 1. 
 
The decision by Japan’s Cabinet aims to align the country’s legal framework with global standards and address concerns raised by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international financial watchdog.
 
Japan’s previous anti-money laundering efforts were deemed insufficient by the FATF, prompting the revision of relevant laws in December. The new measures reflect a growing focus on monitoring crypto assets that can be exploited for money laundering, where illicit funds are disguised as legitimate by routing them through legal transactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With nearly nine million Ordinal inscriptions, the trend that followed, called Bitcoin Stamps, is nearing a milestone of nearly 50,000 stamps recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. Additionally, similar to the BRC20 token economy, the Bitcoin Stamps concept has provided users with the ability to mint fungible tokens with a standard called SRC20.
 
Bitcoin Stamps Inch Closer to 50,000; SRC20 Tokens Enter the Picture
 
While there has been significant attention on Ordinal inscriptions and the BRC20 economy, the Bitcoin Stamps trend is still relatively unknown. As of May 23, 2023, there are currently 46,578 Bitcoin Stamps recorded on the BTC blockchain, approaching the 50,000 milestone. The current number of stamps can be viewed at stampchain.io and rarestamp.xyz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu climbed to a two-week high on Tuesday, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. The meme coin rose by as much as 2% in today’s session, as the global crypto market cap surged by the same amount. BNB was another notable gainer today.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) rose to a multi-week high in today’s session, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets.
 
Following a low of $0.000008759 to start the week, SHIB/USD jumped to a peak of $0.000009067 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, SHIB climbed to its strongest point since May 10, when price hit a high of $0.00000930.
 
 
One of the catalysts of the surge appears to be a breakout which took place on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
The index moved beyond the ceiling of 40.00, and as of writing is now tracking at 40.83.
 
Should bulls continue to control sentiment, there is a chance they target an upcoming ceiling of 46.00 on the index.
 
 
BNB
 
BNB was another notable gainer on Tuesday, as prices rebounded from a key support level.
 
BNB/USD rose to an intraday high of $315.21 in today’s session, 24 hours after hitting a low of $309.13.
 
Overall, this recent run, which has seen BNB climb for two consecutive days, comes after a failed breakout of a floor at $302.00.
 
 
Due to today’s uptrend, the RSI is now on the verge of colliding with a key resistance of 49.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 48.95, with earlier bulls possibly preparing to take profits.

Lawyer Explains How XRP Is Not A Security
 
Bill Morgan pointed to the fact that the ruling of Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court matters a lot in the ongoing case. He explained that XRP would not be categorized as a security if the judge ruled that Ripple’s sales of XRP to On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) customers are not investment contracts and have no indication of profit attached.

Investors Find Other Things To Occupy Their Time
 
Now, when the Ordinals and BRC-20 craze first began, investors flocked to the Bitcoin network which led to a surge in the number of transactions on the network. It wasn’t long until developers were moving this concept to the likes of Dogecoin and Litecoin, both of which operate similarly to the Bitcoin network.
 
 
From this, the DRC-20 tokens were born, allowing for the transfer of fungible tokens on the Dogecoin network just like the Ethereum ERC-20 standard. As their popularity grew, so did the numbe…]]></summary>

Bitcoin mining refers to the process through which new bitcoin is introduced into circulation.

In essence, miners use ASIC hardware to solve complex computational problems, with the first one to find the solution earning a reward of bitcoin before the cycle restarts.
