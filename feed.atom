        <updated>2023-11-22T21:15:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Tom Farley, the former President of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and current CEO of Bullish, shared his optimistic outlook on the future of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, upon the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Farley's comments come amidst the ongoing speculation surrounding the SEC's decision on whether to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF, a move that could potentially open the floodgates for institutional investment in the Bitcoin market.
During the interview, Farley emphasized the significance of a spot ETF approval, asserting that it could be a game-changer for Bitcoin. He highlighted the appeal of a spot ETF, which would allow investors to gain direct exposure to the underlying asset, unlike futures-based ETFs currently available in the market.
"Everyone acknowledges Bitcoin is not a security, including the regulators," said Farley. "Money will flood into the industry with a Bitcoin ETF, it's just easy to buy it. People believe in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a great invention. It is a store of value."



Farley, who recently spearheaded Bullish's acquisition of CoinDesk, expressed confidence in Bitcoin's long-term potential, predicting a substantial inflow of capital into the market once a spot ETF receives regulatory approval. He cited the increasing interest among institutional investors and the broader financial community in gaining access to Bitcoin through traditional investment vehicles.
"This guy ran the New York Stock Exchange, he's all in on Bitcoin and crypto now," said co-anchor of CNBC's Squawk Box Joe Kernen. "They use that as credibility for the asset class."
As the industry eagerly awaits the SEC's decision, the former head of the NYSE's bullish sentiment echoes the growing confidence in Bitcoin's future trajectory, signaling the potential for a significant influx of capital into the market upon the approval of a spot ETF.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Binance, the world’s leading crypto exchange by trading volume, has experienced a significant withdrawal of approximately $1.7 billion in digital assets, as reported by Nansen, a blockchain analysis company. This substantial outflow of funds from Binance occurred shortly after the settlement. As of the latest update, Binance’s diverse array of digital currencies amounts to a total value of $64.98 billion.
 
Post-DOJ Settlement, Binance Faces $1.7 Billion Crypto Exodus, Nansen Data Reveals
 
In the aftermath of the agreement with the DOJ, Binance has seen a noticeable decrease in its crypto holdings, with Nansen highlighting these movements on Wednesday.
 
Within just a 12-hour window on Wednesday, the exchange reported a decrease of $17 million in ethereum (ETH) and, within a 24-hour timeframe, a staggering $956 million worth of various prominent cryptocurrencies exited Binance.
 
 
By 10:11 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, the total withdrawals from Binance had reached $1.7 billion, according to Nansen.
 
At noon the same day, the exchange’s reserves stood at $64.98 billion. Of this, 28.94% is in tether (USDT), while bitcoin (BTC) constitutes roughly 28.7% of the portfolio. Ethereum (ETH) accounts for 10.13%, trueusd (TUSD) makes up 4.6%, and BNB represents 4.31%.
 
 
The remaining 23.32% of Binance’s reserves is spread across numerous other unnamed cryptocurrencies.
 
Regarding its bitcoin holdings, Binance has 511,438 BTC, and its tether reserves total $18.8 billion. Binance operates the largest BTC wallet by size, currently holding 248,597 BTC. Notably, this wallet has not recorded any outgoing transactions since January 7, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, charges against crypto exchange titan Binance Holdings Limited were revealed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), which reached a significant $4.316 billion settlement with the world’s largest crypto exchange for noncompliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Despite Binance’s 2019 claims to bar U.S. users, prosecutors asserted the firm persisted in providing market access to elite, VIP American patrons, who supplied roughly “one-third” of company trading revenue.

This discussion offers a deep dive into the strategic choices and financial nuances.
 
Ripple Is Like Amazon
 
Schwartz, who is known for his straightforward nature and open communication with the XRP community, initiated a thought-provoking dialogue about corporate governance in the context of the drama around OpenAI and Sam Altman.
