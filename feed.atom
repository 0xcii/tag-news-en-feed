SEC And Gensler To Pull Off A Rug Pull?
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Deaton quizzed about whether Gensler was about to pull off the greatest “regulatory rug pull of all time.” The lawyer put forward this question as he highlighted the amount of optimism in the market, as many expect the SEC to approve the pending Spot BTC ETF applications. 
 
 
Specifically, he alluded to the prediction of a 90% chance that these funds will get approved by January 10, 2024. Bloomberg analysts James Seyf…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FTX is preparing to unveil an updated plan for its  
reorganization by mid-December. This plan, aimed at reshaping the future for  
unsecured creditors, comes amid a flurry of activity surrounding the company's  
bankruptcy proceedings.
The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors has  
responded to the insights provided by the FTX 2.0 Customer Ad Hoc Committee,  
emphasizing the need to maintain a balance in asset valuation and distribution  
within the proposed amended reorganization plan. This plan, pivotal in  
determining the fate of stakeholders, seeks to reconcile differing  
perspectives.
Several activities, including a potential  
acquisition by financial services firm Perella Weinberg, loom over the  
bankruptcy proceedings. These activities will be formally presented for court  
approval. Concepts such as recovery rights tokens, mentioned in the FTX 2.0  
Customer Ad Hoc Committee's communication, are under scrutiny by involved  
parties.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Following the successful launch of a stock trading application in the UK, the  
platform has now extended its offerings, enabling eligible European Union  
customers to seamlessly buy and sell over 25 cryptocurrencies. 
As Europe delves deeper into the crypto realm, recent estimates from  
TripleA, a cryptocurrency payment gateway, reveal a substantial user base of  
approximately 31 million digital asset enthusiasts across the continent. The  
critical question arises: which European countries will spearhead grassroots

This fork introduces significant changes to the network’s infrastructure, particularly focusing on token-burning mechanisms and the transition to a more efficient network layer.
 
Enhanced SHIB Burn Mechanism
 
One of the most notable changes in this hard fork, as DaVinci articulated in a Discord update, is the enhancement of the token-burning mechanism. DaVinci stated, “We are undergoing a swift hard fork at Bor Block- 1962000 to enhance our burning mechanism, enabling support for multiple burn tokens, namely BONE and SHIB.”

This makes them “more accessible for developers and projects to use,” Fernandez added.
 
Zero-Knowledge Versus Optimistic Rollups
 
In his written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News via Telegram, Fernandez argued that by offering what he called “a seamless experience” ZK-RaaS can also quicken the “implementation of secure and scalable networks.” While ZK-RaaS are believed to be more secure, Optimistic Rollups-as-a-Service, on the other hand,…]]></summary>
