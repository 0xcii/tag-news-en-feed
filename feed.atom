Average Bitcoin Trade Size Rising In U.S. Exchanges

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The European Commission (EC) is facing criticism from the crypto community over its proposed methodology to calculate and mitigate the “environmental” impact of Bitcoin. 
 
Daniel Batten, co-founder of CH4 Capital, has expressed concerns that the EC’s approach could lead to an EU mining ban and have far-reaching consequences for the global Bitcoin community. Batten argues that the proposed metrics are “unscientific” and ignore the positive environmental externalities of Bitcoin. 
 
Methodology For Bitcoin Environmental Impact Questioned
 
According to Daniel Batten, the EC’s proposed methodology includes measuring crypto-assets resource consumption “per transaction” and relying on reports financially backed by Central Banks and other entities to evaluate Bitcoin’s environmental impact.

At the core of these insights, Hayden Adams spotlighted Uniswap as a key contributor to ETH’s value. His analysis suggests that Uniswap “dominates” ETH’s blockspace usage, accounting for a significant portion of the network’s maximum extractable value (MEV).
 
 
According to the founder of Uniswap, this dominance underscores the practical applications being developed on Ethereum, driving its utility and value. Concurrently, Ryan Sean Adams emphasizes Ethereum’s unique position as a “profitable blockchain.”
