        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US is entering the fray as it backs a class-action lawsuit against tech giant and graphics processing units manufacturer, Nvidia Corp. The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission are appealing to the Supreme Court to revive a case that accuses Nvidia Corp. of misleading investors about its revenue from cryptocurrency mining. This litigation has been on a rollercoaster ride since it was filed in 2018 and is back on the agenda.

This was brought about by the rising tensions in the Middle East as the fear of war wages on. While the decline in the DOGE price created panic among investors, bot everyone has succumbed to the fear. In particular, Dogecoin whales have seen this as an opportunity to load up their bags, buying over a billion coins in one day.
 
Dogecoin Whales Spend $108.7 Million
 
Earlier this week, the Dogecoin price suffered an almost 20% drop from above $0.12. This triggered a wave of sell pressure that continued to strengthen the bears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price action in the past two weeks has reiterated its volatile nature despite the steady flow of institutional money. The cryptocurrency surged in the last days of September from $53,500 to a high of $66,000, only to pull back to $61,000 in the first few days of October, showing its unpredictable nature. 
 
Interestingly, Bitcoin’s rally to reaching $66,000 has led to a change in the investing dynamics among holder cohorts. Furthermore, this change in dynamics reveals that its reversal and retest after the rally is not entirely bad news for Bitcoin’s price. In fact, this shift suggests that the pullback could be setting the stage for a more resilient long-term price outlook for Bitcoin.
