As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the BTC Active Addresses indicator has been on the decline recently. This metric measures, as its name already suggests, the total number of addresses participating in some kind of transaction activity on the Bitcoin blockchain every day.
 
The unique number of active addresses may be considered the same as the unique number of users interacting with the network, so this indicator’s value can tell us about the amount of traffic that BTC is dealing with right now.
