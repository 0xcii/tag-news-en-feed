Hayes remarked, “For all you ADA believers, what dAPP on this list originally launched on Cardano, or has a Cardano offering that is heavily used? From my very limited knowledge, it looks like none of them do. That’s why ADA is dog shit. Charles Hoskinson, pls educate me. Yachtzee.”

The coin, which is associated with the crypto project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has seen a significant 188% surge over the past fourteen days, bolstered by OpenAI’s announcement of the Sora text-to-video application, which has placed the artificial intelligence-backed token in the top 100 cryptocurrencies on the market.
 
While the token’s momentum has slightly waned in the last 24 hours, its recent rally has significantly benefited two of its largest holders, Three Arrows and Alameda Research, both of whom faced difficulties during the 2022 crypto market downturn.
