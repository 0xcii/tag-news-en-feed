        <link href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-analyst-sees-100k-before-halving/"/>
        <updated>2024-03-09T21:13:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Analysts are optimistic about the price trajectory of Bitcoin leading up to the upcoming halving event in April 2024. Projections indicate a potential surge in value post-halving, with estimates ranging from an average peak price of $87,800 to even reaching as high as $100,000, or more.
 
 
This anticipated price increase is fueled by the expected reduction in Bitcoin’s inflation rate following the halving, historically a catalyst for bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market.
 
The world’s most famous cryptocurrency has been on a tear lately, recently surpassing the dizzying heights of $70,000 for the first time ever. But with great gains often comes the fear of great losses, and analysts are scrambling to predict what the future holds for this volatile digital asset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meme coins have ballooned to new prices since the beginning of March, boosting blockchain activity in the process. This recent frenzy has seen Ethereum gas fees surging to two-year highs this week. 
 
IntoTheBlock, a leading on-chain analytics provider, announced this new milestone in a recent post on social media platform X. Data from ITB indicates that Ethereum mainnet’s revenue from network fees reached $193 million this week, pushing the annualized rate to the highest point since early 2022. 
 
 
Ethereum’s $190M+ in weekly fees puts it at an annualized rate of over $10B for the first time since early 2022. 
Due to Ethereum’s fee-burn mechanism, this also has an impact on the supply, decreasing it by 33k ETH (~$125M) this week. pic.twitter.com/iAibEvzh4j

Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading cryptocurrency, shattered its previous all-time high on Friday, reaching a staggering $70,199. This astronomical rise has ignited a firestorm of debate within the crypto community. Is this a sign of a resurgent bull market, or a fleeting frenzy before a correction?
 
 
Investor Jitters: Second Thoughts After The Surge
 
While the headlines scream record highs, a sense of cautious hesitation hangs in the air. The initial euphoria that accompanied Bitcoin’s $60,000 milestone appears to be fading, replaced by a wait-and-see approach from investors. This is evident in on-chain data from Santiment, which reveals signs of investor fatigue alongside a growing fascination with alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).
