        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to consolidate on Monday, ahead of U.S. debt ceiling talks with President Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. It is expected that if a deal isn’t reached this week, the government will run out of cash on June 1. Ethereum was marginally higher.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the week in consolidation, as markets remain hopeful of a deal to increase the debt ceiling in the United States.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,549.73, which comes less than 24 hours after a high at $26,986.08.
 
Overall, Monday’s move is the third straight day in which BTC has traded below the $27,000 mark.

From the chart, it appears that BTC has now found a firm floor at $26,300, with prices hovering slightly above that point.
 
In order for a significant move to take place, a ceiling of 44.00, or support at 39.00, on the relative strength index (RSI), will need to be broken.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.18.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rose slightly higher on Monday, as it once again bounced from a key support point.
 
Following a low of $1,793.22 on Sunday, ETH/USD climbed to a peak of $1,820.25 earlier in the day.
 
The drop saw ethereum near its recent price floor at the $1,790 mark, however bulls used this as a sign to reenter the market.

Still, earlier gains have somewhat dropped, with the index currently tracking close to a ceiling of 46.00.
 
In order for momentum to fully turn bullish, this resistance will need to be broken, which is unlikely to happen until a debt ceiling deal is reached.

The Inscriptions only became possible when the Ordinals protocol emerged earlier in the year, and since then, they have seen a number of applications and have earned some rapid popularity.

The Ordinals controversy is still simmering and seems set to flare up again soon. Although Ordinals’ block space usage had been trending down since March 23, 2023, the release of notable collections and a burgeoning mania for BRC-20 tokens seems to have reversed that trend. 
Should competition for block space between Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens and purely monetary transactions remain high, so will fees. And, should fees climb sufficiently high, the ghastly shades of the blocksize war may rise once more to torment all Bit-kind.
The Case Against Ordinals

Analysts observe that several code enhancements following this update could significantly help slash gas fees for users relying on smart contracts for their decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible token (NFT) operations.
 
In Ethereum, every transaction, including simple transfers, attracts a fee in ETH. The fee paid is measured in “gas” and varies depending on the complexity and type of transactions. 
 
 
To illustrate, the more complex a transaction is, the higher the gas fees. This is because more computation is required to process a complex transaction. Meanwhile, some transac…]]></summary>
