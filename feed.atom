Amongst Bitcoiners, it has also become a derogatory term used to refer to altcoins, as seen in the oft-repeated phrase “Bitcoin, Not Crypto.” However, not everything in the crypto world is truly "crypto," at least not in the literal sense of the name.
The true essence of a cryptocurrency lies in its reliance on cryptography, and nothing else, to secure its network. This brings us to an essential distinction: only proof-of-work coins can be genuinely considered “crypto.” This distinction is not just semantic but fundamentally important, as it underscores what exactly strengthens the ledger.

Many continue to speculate that these revisions could mean that approval of these funds by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is imminent as it forms part of the process before an ETF launches. 
 
Notables From VanEck’s Revised Prospectus 
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, prominent finance lawyer Scott Johnsson mentioned how the asset manager’s revised prospectus shared a similar language to BlackRock’s as it relates to seeding. However, he said it isn’t too surprising since the same lawyers at the international law firm Clifford Chance represent both asset managers.

This ominous date, etched indelibly in financial history, is synonymous with a “black swan” event, characterized by its profoundly adverse nature and the near-impossibility of prediction. The following narrative embarks on a retrospective journey through the events of that memorable day in 2020.

USDT Dominates Other Cryptocurrencies In Trading Volume
 
Notably, Stablecoins account for about 10% of the global cryptocurrency trading volume. Most people regard the class of digital assets as a haven during increased market volatility. This may be due to their fiat currency peg that makes them relatively stable than conventional crypto assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana surged to near a one-year high to start the week, as bulls pushed the cryptocurrency above the $35.00 level. Today’s surge comes as the global crypto market cap rallied, following a recent bout of consolidation. Avalanche also edged higher, surging by 5% today.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was one of the notable gainers in the market on Monday, as the token climbed above the $35.00 mark.
 
Following a low of $32.29 on Sunday, SOL/USD rose to an intraday high at $35.17 to start the week.
 
This is the highest level the cryptocurrency has hit since November 6 last year, when the price was trading above $37.00.
 
 
Solana was one of the biggest tokens to fall following the FTX fraud scandal, however price has made steady gains since then.
 
Today’s surge comes as the relative strength index (RSI) rallied above a ceiling at 74.00, and now sits at 77.33.
 
SOL remains above $35.00 as of writing, however, bulls could begin taking profits in the coming days.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
Avalanche (AVAX) made sizable gains to start the week, moving by as much as 6% higher during the day.
 
AVAX/USD peaked at $11.60 on Monday, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a bottom at $10.92.
 
This has resulted in avalanche rising to its strongest point since October 7, when price last surpassed a ceiling at $11.70.
 
 
Earlier gains have marginally faded, with AVAX now sitting at $11.57, and this comes as the RSI hit a ceiling at 70.00.
 
Price strength is now hovering at 69.40, however bulls will likely look to break this mark, and force a move above 70.00 in the coming days.

        <updated>2023-10-30T15:35:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a compelling tale of persistence and financial prudence, a Reddit user embarked on a unique investment experiment, demonstrating the potential rewards of consistently investing small amounts, or dollar cost averaging, into Bitcoin. 
The Redditor, going by the handle u/Gorillahair2000, initiated an experiment to determine whether allocating just $5 per day into Bitcoin was a worthwhile endeavor, and over the course of one full year, diligently recorded their progress.
After 365 days of investing $5 per day, the Redditor accumulated a total stack of 0.075 Bitcoin. The average purchase price stood at $24,108.58, while the current price of Bitcoin was $34,158.20. 
The total expenditure over the year amounted to $1,825.00, and the current value of the investment was $2,585.75, yielding a net change of +41.68%.
The Redditor also noted that they accounted for the 0.5-1.0% spread on each of their purchases, meaning the gains remained after adjusting for fees. The user indicated that they buy with Strike, a popular Bitcoin Lightning wallet, and then withdraw the Bitcoin to a hardware wallet, in line with industry best practices.
In a year's time, they transformed the daily expense equivalent to a Starbucks coffee into $2,500 in current value, or a $750 gain.
The experiment proves that even with a modest budget, investing in Bitcoin can yield significant returns, and it further demonstrates the power of dollar-cost averaging, a strategy that involves consistently purchasing assets at fixed intervals, regardless of their price, thereby mitigating the effects of market volatility.
Further, it also highlights Bitcoin's main advantages as a sound money, one that doesn't depreciate like traditional savings vehicles tied to inflationary fiat currencies.]]></summary>
