In a series of posts on X on December 30, Buterin spoke extensively on Ethereum’s gameplan for the new year, which he claims is quite similar to the plan for 2023, albeit with a few changes.
 
 
Ethereum Roadmap 2024
 
According to information revealed by Buterin, the main focus of Ethereum for 2024 centers around six key goals, namely the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.
 
The Ethereum Merge aims to create an ideal, simple, robust, and decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) network. 
 
The Merge occurred in September 2022 with the integration of the Ethereum mainnet with the Beacon Chain, thus marking the end of the proof-of-work consensus algorithm. Speaking on post-Merge i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitwise has revealed in an amended filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a plan to seed its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with $200 million. This significantly exceeds Blackrock’s $10 million seed commitment for its spot Bitcoin ETF that’s planned for Jan. 3.
 
Bitwise’s $200 Million Plan to Seed Spot Bitcoin ETF
 
Bitwise is one of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applicants that submitted an amended filing (S-1) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday. Once launched, Bitwise’s spot bitcoin ETF will trade under the ticker symbol BITB.
 
According to the firm’s filing with the SEC, an unnamed entity “has indicated an interest in purchasing an aggregate of up to $200 million of shares in this offering from authorized participants or in the marketplace through broker-dealers.” Commenting on the asset manager’s filing, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out on social media platform X:
 

Bitwise S-1 has been filed and it looks like someone (I wonder who) is going to seed BITB with $200m, which blows away Blackrock’s $10m (that we know of). That’s gonna be huge help in early days of race.
 
However, Bitwise cautioned: “Because indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, this potential purchaser could determine to purchase more, fewer or no shares.”
 
 
 
Last week, Blackrock revealed in an amended filing with the SEC a plan to seed its spot bitcoin ETF with $10 million on Jan. 3.
 
Earlier this month, Bitwise unveiled 10 crypto predictions for 2024, including its expectation for bitcoin to trade above $80,000. The asset manager also believes that “spot bitcoin ETFs will be approved, and collectively they will be the most successful ETF launch of all time.” Moreover, Bitwise expects spot bitcoin ETFs to “capture 1% of the $7.2 trillion U.S. ETF market, or $72 billion in AUM.”

        <updated>2023-12-30T19:38:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the meme coin phenomenon bonk (BONK) captivated users on the Solana network, the cryptocurrency recently witnessed a 41% decline over the preceding fortnight, accompanied by a 20.8% descent in the past week. Following its mid-December peak to an all-time high (ATH), BONK has plummeted 57% from its ATH. 
 
From Peak to Plunge in the Meme Coin Madness
 
BONK has witnessed a downturn over the past two weeks and on Dec. 30, 2023, it has an intraday trading range of $0.00001387 to $0.00001536, and at the time of writing, it is exchanging hands for $0.00001446, down 4.4% over the past day. While the crypto asset lost 41% over the two-week span and more than 20% this past week, BONK is still up by 272% over the last 30 days.
 

 
However, with prices at $0.00001446, the value of BONK is down 57% since the ATH of $0.00003416 per unit on Dec. 15, 2023. Despite the loss, BONK is still the third largest meme coin asset by market capitalization under DOGE and SHIB, and its overall valuation today is $887 million. BONK’s market cap is above the fourth largest meme coin CORGIAI’s $633 million valuation.
 
There are 56.02 trillion BONK in circulation as of Dec. 30, 2023, and 566,773 addresses hold BONK. The top ten wallets command 33.72% of the circulating supply and the top 20 holders command 40.49% of all the BONK. The top 100 BONK holders command 55.08% while the top address holds 11.68%.
 
 
The future trajectory of bonk (BONK) remains uncertain as the market’s whims could either further its decline or foster a resurgence. Amidst its current volatility, other meme coins are vying for the spotlight, each aspiring to replicate BONK’s earlier success. As these contenders inch closer, the landscape of meme cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, leaving BONK’s fate in the balance amidst this competitive fray.
