News reports have shown many creditors have been repaid through the US-based crypto exchange Kraken. As expected, the news of more BTC potentially flooding the market has led to concerns about its effects on the price of Bitcoin. Analysts and investors alike have expressed concerns that the influx of Bitcoin into the market could result in increased selling pressure, potentially driving down the price of the cryptocurrency.
 
However, data reports have shown many of the repaid creditors are opting to hold their assets rather than selling them. This trend reflects a prevailing bullish sentiment among these BTC holders, who appear confident in the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Casa, a leading provider of Bitcoin self-custody services, has announced an integration with YubiKeys, enabling users to secure their Bitcoin vaults with Yubikeys. 
YubiKeys are small physical devices that provide multi-factor authentication and securely store sensitive data like passwords and keys. By integrating support for YubiKeys, Casa members can now use the devices as one of the keys in their multi-signature Bitcoin vaults.
When setting up a YubiKey with Casa, users generate a Bitcoin seed phrase locally on their computer. This seed is then stored on the YubiKey itself, protected by a passkey. 
The integration uses passkey cryptography to ensure the seed phrase never leaves the YubiKey and can only be accessed when authenticating through Casa's service.
Casa emphasises this provides superior security over traditional wallet recovery seeds, which can be vulnerable to phishing and theft if written down or stored digitally. With a YubiKey, the seed is cryptographically bound to Casa's domain, preventing phishing attacks.
By integrating with YubiKeys, Casa provides its members with more flexibility in securing their Bitcoin. YubiKeys offer convenience through their compact size and easy tap-to-use authentication. The company plans to open-source the core integration code in the future.
The launch demonstrates growing development in Bitcoin self-custody approaches as demand grows from both retail and institutional users to make self-custody more secure, better, and easier.]]></summary>
