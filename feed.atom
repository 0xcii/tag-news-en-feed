        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, meme coins rallied hard after Elon Musk changed the Twitter logo to the famous Dogecoin meme. DOGE lead the rally with double-digit gains, climbing as high as 26% in a matter of hours. However, the largest meme coin by market cap was not the only one to benefit from this. Other meme coins quickly followed suit, returning significant gains for their investors during this time.
 
Meme Coins See Upside
 
The meme coins were able to break out from the rest of the crypto market once Dogecoin began to rally. Elon Musk’s tweet triggered a recovery above $0.1 for the meme coin and investors flocked to similar assets to take advantage of the pump.
 
 
As a result, other meme coins such as Shiba Inu, Floki Inu, and Dogelon Mars have all seen significant upside in the last day. Trai…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-up-30-following-twitter-logo-change/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-04T15:40:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin continued to trade close to a four-month high on Tuesday, following a 30% price surge to start the week. The rally came after Twitter changed its logo from the traditional blue bird, to a cartoon picture of Doge. Shiba inu was also higher, as it moved to a multi-week high.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was one of today’s biggest gainers, as markets continued to react to Twitter’s logo change.
 
DOGE/USD raced to a high of $0.1026 late on Monday, following a low of $0.07663 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this move, the meme coin rose to its strongest point since December 5, when it hit a peak of $0.1118.
 
 
Looking at the chart, Tuesday’s surge appears to coincide with the relative strength index (RSI) breaking out of a ceiling at 70.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 73.45, which is its highest reading since November.
 
Overall, dogecoin is up over 30% at the time of writing, and nearly 40% higher than at the same time last week.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Another notable gainer on Tuesday was shiba inu (SHIB), which moved to a three-week high in the past several hours.
 
Following a low of $0.00001065 to start the week, SHIB/USD climbed to a peak of $0.00001157 yesterday evening.
 
This resulted in prices jumping by as much as 6%, hitting their highest level since March 14 in the process.
 
 
Similar to DOGE, the move seemingly took place following a breakout of a key resistance level of 55.00 on the RSI indicator.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 55.76, and appears to be heading towards a higher ceiling at 58.00.
 
Should it reach its apparent target, SHIB will likely move beyond March’s high of $0.00001184.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The exchange cites staff departures and regulatory challenges for the suspension, saying they’re “not sure if it will come back.”
 
         
         
         
         
    
Paxful, one of the world’s largest peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchanges by volume, has announced the suspension of its marketplace. The announcement was made by the company's founder and CEO, Ray Youssef, who cited key staff departures and regulatory challenges for the industry as the reasons behind the decision. In a statement, Youssef said, "While we work through these issues, we have taken the most secure option and ask you to explore self-custody and trade elsewhere."
According to Youssef, all customer funds are accounted for, and the Paxful Wallet will be up for customers to retrieve their funds. To facilitate the process, Paxful is recommending options such as Exodus Wallet and Muun Wallet for customers to self-custody their funds. The company is also offering an easy migration to other options for non-U.S. users, including Noones, a new P2P company dedicated to the Global South, and Bitnob, which makes it easy for Africans to connect with Bitcoin.
Youssef personally vouches for Noones, which offers lower trading fees, a cheaper wallet, a “more generous affiliate program than Paxful's program, a more efficient KYC process, local dispute moderators,” and a “friendlier TOS policy with no accounts being locked.”
The news of Paxful's suspension comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry, particularly in the U.S. Paxful's move highlights the challenges facing the industry and the importance of self-custody for investors. It also underscores the need for more secure and reliable P2P cryptocurrency exchanges that can withstand regulatory pressures and ensure the safety of customers' funds.]]></summary>

Lending platform Moon Mortgage has launched its core mortgage product that allows investors to use their bitcoin as additional collateral to secure funding for real estate purchases.
The mortgage product has been designed to work similarly to traditional mortgages, with digital assets like Bitcoin serving as collateral, and is available to house buyers in Florida, Texas, and Colorado, with plans to expand to investors in most states across the US for investment properties. The minimum loan amount for the mortgage product is $1 million.
According to Tristan Marino, Co-founder and COO of Moon Mortgage, "The use case for crypto has to go beyond investment potential. It has to be about how an investor can use it for real-world gains...allowing investors to truly materialize their digital wealth into real estate investments, as simply as possible and with compliance and safety." Marino added that Moon Mortgage is working to bridge the gap between traditional finance and bitcoin, with its mortgage product being a part of its efforts to transform the bitcoin and cryptocurrency space into a true financial system.
In addition to this mortgage product, Moon Mortgage has also launched Trade & Borrow, which allows investors to borrow against bitcoin.. Moon Mortgage's two new products follow a $3.5 million seed raise in October 2022, and the platform is actively looking to engage more brokers to partner with as it seeks to build in scale to supply investor demand.]]></summary>

An analysis of the exploit revealed that a renegade validator switched the MEV bots’ transactions and seized various crypto tokens, such as 7,460 wrapped ether and 64 wrapped bitcoin.
 
While the Mechanisms Behind MEV Bots Boost Profit, They Also Have Vulnerability to Exploits
 
Recently, crypto proponents and security experts have been discussing how a group of MEV bots lost $25.3 million in a sophisticated exploit. The attacker used a transaction manipulation tactic that enabled the rogue validator to replace several MEV transactions, resulting in the loss of a significant amount of WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, and WETH.
