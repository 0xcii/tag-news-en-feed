        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nigerian crypto exchange Patricia has raised suspicions following its newly launched Patricia Stablecoin labeled PTK and its unilateral decision to convert users’ funds to its stablecoin without its users’ consent.
 
Patricia’s Dubious Move
 
In May 2023, the Nigerian exchange Patricia reportedly fell victim to a hack and reportedly lost close to $2 million. During this period, clients and users faced a lot of difficulties gaining access to their funds as Patricia froze all withdrawals in its platform and provided a statement to assure its worried users about the situation of their funds.
 
 
However, Patricia users were still able to withdraw their funds via the crypto exchange’s newly launched app known as Patricia Plus App, but only a few withdrawals were processed as the platform could…]]></summary>

This time, the company inscribed both the front and back cover of the magazine, as the “Withdrawal Issue” shows a unique full-spread design, complete with the spine.
Differently from previous launches, Bitcoin Magazine’s Q3 print magazine cover was inscribed leveraging state-of-the-art recursion technology, which has become popular with users of the Ordinals protocol.
Recursion works by allowing an inscription to reference other inscriptions previously added to Bitcoin. Many different use cases can arise from such an arrangement, and in this case the goal was to achieve print-quality digital image, while lowering the storag…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin stayed close to a two-week high on Thursday, as markets rebounded from a slight sell-off during yesterday’s session. Traders moved to secure profits over the last 24 hours, following strong gains on Tuesday. Solana neared a drop below $20.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) remained close to a multi-week high during today’s session, as bulls attempted to maintain recent pressure.
 
After sliding to a low of $0.06468 on Wednesday, DOGE/USD moved to a peak of $0.06692 earlier today.
 
This was marginally below Tuesday’s high of $0.0687, which is the strongest level the meme coin had hit since mid-August.
 
 
Bullish momentum has eased in recent days since the relative strength index (RSI) collided with a resistance level of 48.00.
 
Price strength has since tailed off, and at the time of writing this is now tracking at the 45.92 mark.
 
Should a break out of the aforementioned ceiling take place in the coming days, bulls will likely attempt to take the price above $0.0700.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
On the other hand, solana (SOL) extended a recent losing streak on Thursday, with the price moving closer to a drop below $20.00.
 
SOL/USD bottomed out at $20.55 earlier in today’s session, which comes following a high of $21.01 the day prior.
 
The recent shift in sentiment comes as solana bulls were unable to orchestrate a move beyond a resistance level of $22.
 
 
It now seems inevitable that the token will fall to a floor at $20, depending on where the RSI lands.
 
As of writing this, the index is at a reading of 41.73, with a support point of 39.00 a possible target for sellers.
 
Solana could drop under the $20.00 level in the not-too-distant future, in the event this floor is hit.

The relevant indicator here is the “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio,” which measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the realized cap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin edged lower once again on Thursday, as traders continued to capture profits following gains on Tuesday. The latest drop followed data revealing U.S. gross domestic product growth in the second quarter that undershot expectations. Ethereum likewise declined, dipping under $1,700.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was in the red for a second consecutive session, as a mixture of profit-taking and general bearish sentiment impacted price.
 
Following a peak of $27,490.77 on hump day, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,069.21 earlier today.
 
The sell-off comes a few days removed from bitcoin moving above $28,000, following Grayscale’s court win against the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC).
 
 
On a technical note, the decline coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failing to move beyond its ceiling at 53.00.
 
As of writing this, the index is now tracking at a reading of 47.50, with the next visible floor at the 43.00 level.
 
Should momentum push price strength to this point, there is a good chance that the price will drop below $27,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) was back in the red on Thursday, with price falling below the $1,700 level.
 
ETH/USD dropped to the bottom of $1,697.15 earlier in the day, which comes following a high of $1,721.62 the day prior.
 
Like with bitcoin, the decline appears to be a result of profit-taking, after ethereum surged to a multi-week high on Tuesday.
 
 
In order for bulls to maintain the momentum from earlier in the week, a breakout will need to occur at the 49.00 level on the RSI.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 45.65, with price back above $1,700.
