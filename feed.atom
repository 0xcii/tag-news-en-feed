defending Sam Bankman-Fried have been granted permission to conduct “unlimited”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent  
years, the cryptocurrency environment has undergone extraordinary change, with  
one of the most significant transitions being the increased interest and  
participation of institutional players in the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin, long

a genuine investment alternative among institutional investors. 
We dive into  
key trends of institutional actors embracing Bitcoin, examining the  
ramifications for the cryptocurrency market, traditional finance, and the

A group of shareholders of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) have banded together in the first-of-its-kind activist campaign organized through X (formerly Twitter). Their goal: bringing legal action against Grayscale in an attempt to force them to allow redemptions for customer cryptocurrency held within the trusts it operates and to repay “exorbitant" management fees.
Though initially a grassroots campaign, one of the largest GBTC and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) shareholders, Alameda Research, has filed a lawsuit against Grayscale with numerous funds joining as plaintiffs: Fir Tree Partners, Saba Capital, Owl Creek Asset Management, UTXO Management and Aristides Capital. The complaint was filed in Delaware’s Chancery Court, with the assertion that Grayscale has breached …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded from recent lows on Thursday, as bulls moved to buy the dip, following a drop below the $26,000 level. The rally comes as traders rejected a full breakout below a key support point of $25,600. Ethereum was also back in the green during today’s session. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin climbed higher on Thursday, as bulls moved to buy the recent dip in price, following a drop below the $26,000 level.
 
After trading at a low of $25,805.00 on Wednesday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak of $26,786.90 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the strongest point that bitcoin has hit since last Thursday, when the cryptocurrency was trading above the $28,000 mark.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge sent the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) to a ceiling of 28.00, which is also a one-week high.
 
As of writing, price strength has moved below this point, however should a breakout occur, there is a good chance that BTC will head above $27,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also back in the green, and neared a breakout above the $1,700 zone late on Wednesday.
 
ETH/USD rallied to a high of $1,696.59 during yesterday’s session, less than 24 hours after the price was at a bottom $1,634.87.
 
Like with BTC above, today saw ethereum trade at its highest point in a week, with price peaking above $1,800 last Thursday.
 
 
The 14-day RSI has also collided with a key resistance level, in this occasion at the 34.00 zone.
 
Sentiment has marginally shifted, with the index now at 32.04, resulting in the easing of earlier gains.

Ultimately, its proven store-of-value qualities are inseparably linked to utility: items of value at some point must be usable.
