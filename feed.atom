        <updated>2023-09-18T14:04:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After capturing $66.5 billion in May, decentralized exchange (dex) trade volumes have fallen for four consecutive months, with August statistics reaching a 2023 low of $41.7 billion. Metrics for the first half of September do not show improvement, with decentralized exchange trade volumes at about $16.96 billion as of September 18, 2023. 
 
Dex Volumes Nosedive 37% Post-May
 
Dex trade volumes have fallen significantly over the past four months. Data indicate that March saw the year’s highest dex trade volume at $112 billion. In April, volumes declined by 47.26% to $59.06 billion.
 
May experienced a 12.59% increase, with trade volumes rising to $66.5 billion; of that amount, Uniswap’s dex trades contributed $33.67 billion. Since May, however, dex trade volume has declined by 37.29%.
 

 
August data indicate dex trade volume at $41.7 billion, with $24.87 billion, or 59.64%, coming from Uniswap trades. Pancakeswap saw $6.76 billion in trades, while Curve Finance contributed $3.79 billion.
 
Those three dex protocols totaled $35.42 billion in August, making up 84.94% of the month’s global dex volumes. Although September isn’t finished, its dex volumes to date already appear lackluster.
 
As of September 18, 2023, the global dex trade volume stands at $16.96 billion. Approximately $10.27 billion of that total comes from Uniswap trades, about $3.14 billion from PancakeSwap, and $1.07 billion from Curve.
 
 
With only 12 days remaining in September, dex trade volumes might finish below August’s numbers. The data is further highlighted in a monthly crypto recap report by the digital asset manager Vaneck, which indicated a decline in August’s onchain economic activity tied to decentralized finance (defi).
 
“Decentralized exchange volume experienced a more severe decline,” wrote Matthew Sigel, Vaneck’s head of Digital Assets Research.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu’s Shibarium has gained traction in the month following its launch, as the adoption of the Ethereum layer-2 solution seems to be growing at an impressive rate. However, while Shibarium seems to be doing well, this hasn’t really translated into a steady growth in the price of SHIB, leading to sporadic FUD and concerns from the project. 
 
In response to these growing concerns, Lucie, a prominent member of Shiba Inu’s development team and content marketer, took to social media platform X to calm the waters.
 
Quieting The Storm
 
In the tweet, Lucie noted that she had received many direct messages from concerned community members concerning Shiba Inu. But Lucie assured the community that these are mostly propelled by SHIB pessimists looking to promote their projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin pushed past the $27,000 level on Monday, as markets prepared for the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Bullish sentiment was in full force in today’s session, despite the prospect of yet another rate hike. Ethereum was also higher to start the week.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin surged to a multi-week high on Monday, as traders began to anticipate the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.
 
BTC/USD rallied to an intraday high of $27,222.98 earlier in today’s session, following a low of $26,415.52 the day prior.
 
As a result of the move, bitcoin climbed to its strongest point since August 31, when price peaked at $27,576.

Despite the rise in momentum, bulls may not be satisfied, and are likely targeting a ceiling at the $28,000 mark.
 
Monday’s gain comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped past a ceiling of 53.00, and is now residing at 58.25.
 
A resistance level of 60.00 will likely be the next major target for bulls currently in the market.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also moved higher to start the week, as traders rejected a breakout below the $1,600 point.
 
Following a low of $1,609.96 on Sunday, ETH/USD rose to an intraday high of $1,653.07 earlier in the day.
 
This has resulted in ethereum surging to its highest point in the past ten days, closing in on a recent resistance of $1,660 in the process.

Although price strength in ETH has also surpassed an obstacle of its own, it is on the cusp of colliding with another at the 50.00 mark. The index currently sits at a reading of 49.61.
 
It is likely that a breakout above this mark could lead ETH back above $1,700.

Pizzino, known for his insightful analysis, recently took to YouTube to voice his conviction that Bitcoin is currently in the early stages of a bull market. His insights are setting the crypto community abuzz.
 
In his latest YouTube video, Pizzino emphasized that the cryptocurrency market is displaying compelling signs of strength and the potential for significant growth. While crypto markets can be notoriously unpredictable, Pizzino believes that the alpha coin is primed for an impressive uptrend. 
 
However, he cautions that the beginnings of a bull market are not always crystal clear. As Pizzino puts it:

While regulatory uncertainty still looms over other more centralized, digital assets, the CFTC's classification of Bitcoin as a commodity established a regulatory framework for Bitcoin, one that allows it to be treated like other classical commodities including gold and precious metals.
In its ruling, the CFTC stated that Section 1a(9) of the CEA defines commodity to include "all services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin and crypto market is holding its breath in anticipation of the week ahead, particularly due to a singular, critical event: the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision followed by the FOMC press conference featuring Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This looming decision has the potential to ripple through all financial markets, from Wall Street to the decentralized corridors of Bitcoin and crypto.
 
Other events that could have a potential impact on the market are rather rare this week. Only the already last week approved liquidation of the FTX holdings (maximum $100 million, $200 million per week under certain circumstances) could be news-worthy. However, since the liquidations do not require any announcements, there will be no big headlines.
