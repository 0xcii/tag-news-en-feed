        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a report from Reuters, Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO and co-founder of the now-bankrupt FTX exchange, has pleaded not guilty to a recent charge accusing him of fraud and conspiracy. This action was taken in the first court appearance of Bankman-Fried since a US court revoked his bail in early August.
 
In a hearing presided over by Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn in the Southern District of New York courthouse, SBF made a “not guilty” plea to the seven criminal charges. His mother, Stanford Law School professor Barbara Fried, was reportedly in attendance.
 
The former CEO is currently being held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, which his lawyers complained about. Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried’s lawyer, said during the recent hearing that his client had been denied acces…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon was one of the biggest movers in crypto markets on Tuesday, as the token fell by over 5% in today’s session. The decline saw the token fall to its weakest point in two months, breaking out of a key support point in the process. Cardano was also in the red today.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 

 
Polygon (MATIC) dropped to a two-month low on Tuesday, as the token lost over 5% of its market value.
 

 
After peaking at $0.5679 to start the week, MATIC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.5351 earlier in the day.
 

 
The sell-off saw polygon plunge to its weakest point since June 10, when price neared a breakout below $0.5000.
 

 

 

 
Today’s move came as MATIC fell under a support point of $0.5600, with the relative strength index (RSI) also edging lower.
 

 
As of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 21.24, since slipping below a floor at the 24.00 level.
 

 
Should momentum remain bearish in the coming days, it is likely MATIC will fall under $0.5000.
 

 

 
Cardano (ADA)
 

 
In addition to MATIC, cardano (ADA) was also in the red during today’s session, falling for a second straight day.
 

 
ADA/USD slipped to a bottom of $0.2582 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $0.2684.
 

 
The decline sees cardano move closer to a key support point of $0.2500, following last week’s breakout below this mark.
 

 

 

 
Looking at the chart, the RSI is also edging closer to a floor of its own at 30.00, and is currently tracking at 32.56.
 

 
In the event a move occurs below this mark, ADA bears will likely look to exit short positions at $0.2400.

Bitcoin is becoming increasingly relevant to everyday people as financial crises prompt discussion about how to improve our systems of finance, banking and government spending. Although the prevailing wisdom is that it’s better to get people to just use it and put off most of the learning until later, adoption will be more sustainable if people understand why Bitcoin is important, not just why it’s convenient.
