Brody tweeted his opinion on the speeches at the Real World Summit. 
 
Brody believes that big banks building or exploring private chains like R3 Corda will soon realize their approach is “ineffective in driving adoption.” 
 
Ernest & Young Blockchain Lead Endorses Public Networks
 
The Real World Asset Summit, sponsored by top crypto firms, including Coinbase—a crypto exchange—and Circle—the issuer of USDC—the second largest stablecoin after USDT–was an invite-only conference held on September 19. Brody and other attendees heard about tokenization, cryptocurrency, and credit from experts.

Launched earlier this year in January, Bitcoin Ordinals are inscriptions (digital artifacts or non-fungible tokens) supported by satoshis (sats) — a way to denominate small amounts of Bitcoin. This type of digital asset has steadily carved its niche in the blockchain world. 
 
Each non-fungible token (NFT) created via the Ordinals protocol receives a distinct inscription, much like a unique serial number.

Paypal Stablecoin PYUSD Makes Its Way to Venmo
 
Paypal has disclosed that Venmo users can now leverage the firm’s proprietary stablecoin, PYUSD. The rollout is starting with select Venmo users, but soon all Venmo customers will be able to “able to purchase PYUSD and send it to friends and family on Paypal, Venmo, and compatible external wallets.”
 
The company notes that transfers between Paypal users and Venmo are “fast and free,” with the exception of blockchain network fees. PYUSD is an ERC20 token, which means the coin is subject to fees associated with the Ethereum fee market and block space.
 
For example, etherscan.io indicates that the cost to transfer an ERC20 token on September 20, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. (ET), ranges from $2.65 to $2.91 per transaction. Paypal further mentions in the announcement that PYUSD is now available on various platforms, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Kraken, MetaMask, Ledger, Phantom, Bitpay, and Fireblocks, among others.
 
The payments company also highlights its recent approval by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The latest development comes on the heels of PYUSD’s first transparency report, which unveiled the backing of cash and U.S. Treasury reverse repurchase agreements as reserves.
 
 
As of September 20, approximately 44.37 million PYUSD coins are in circulation. A total of 698 distinct addresses currently hold PYUSD, with these wallets collectively executing 3,354 transfers since the currency’s launch. Additionally, the top 100 holders jointly possess 99.96% of the PYUSD supply, equivalent to 44,358,474.05 PYUSD tokens.
