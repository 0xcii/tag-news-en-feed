Evid. 1006,” which aims to aid the court by providing straightforward arithmetic calculations based on Ripple’s financial records. The SEC’s motion states that “It is not an expert’s report, does not rely on specialized expertise, and does not render any opinions at all, let alone an ‘expert’ one.”

Bitcoin Hashcoin Has Set A New All-Time High Now
 
As explained by CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno in a post on X, the BTC Hashcoin has set a new record. The “Hashcoin” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the daily Hashrate miners require to produce 1 BTC.
 
The Hashrate measures the computing power that the miners have attached to the Bitcoin network. This metric is measured in terms of hashes per second, or, in the much bigger and more practical unit these days, exahashes per second (EH/s).
