Bitcoin 7-Day MA Puell Multiple Has Surged Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Puell Multiple is currently at the second highest level for the year. The “Puell Multiple” is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the daily Bitcoin miner revenue and the 365-day moving average (MA) of the same.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the miners are currently earning more than the average for the past year. On the other hand, the indicator being below the mark suggests these chain validators are making less than usual right now.

He ran on a platform promising substantial reforms: cutting spending, reducing government intervention, addressing inflation, and eliminating the central bank.
Milei's path to victory was unexpected. In the general elections, he secured second place with 30% of the vote, trailing Sergio Massa of the Peronist establishment, who garnered 37%. Patricia Bullrich, former Minister of Security under President Macri's administration, obtained 24%. These results forced Balotaje, or a run-off election between Massa and Milei.

His views challenge the widely held belief that BTC, as a ‘risk-on’ asset, would suffer in economic downturns, offering a nuanced understanding of its relationship with market liquidity and economic cycles.
 
Why Bitcoin May Rise During A Prolonged Recession
 
Clemente’s argument hinges on the understanding of BTC as a hedge against monetary debasement rather than a conventional asset tied to economic performance. He explained, “Bitcoin is a hedge against monetary debasement. It goes down when liquidity declines and goes up when liquidity rises.”
