It is not surprising therefore that bitcoiners and ethereans should hold a long-standing rivalry. As the largest blockchain ecosystems, each running on distinct architecture and supporting distinct use cases, there are fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum.
These differences aren’t just technical but also cultural. Just as flora and fauna on Madagascar evolved differently from that on larger land masses, distinct crypto tribes form their own culture, memes, and ideology over time. Eventually, like Montagues and Capulets, they can’…]]></summary>

However, both sides have since backed down, giving the markets time to recover.

This event is expected to have a major impact on the sector due to recent developments surrounding the leading digital asset. Some of these developments include the emergence of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the evolving regulations for digital assets.
How Bitcoin Halving Works
Bitcoin's deflationary model depends on the upcoming halving  
event, which occurs approximately every four years. This process reduces the block reward by half, limiting the supply of new tokens. With each halving, the number of Bitcoins in circulation becomes scarce.
The impending halving will reduce the block reward
