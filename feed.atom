        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Monday, the Shiba Inu team behind TREAT announced a significant financial boost with a $12 million investment from strategic venture capital partners led by Cypher Capital. This funding is set to advance the development of a next-generation Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) blockchain utilizing TREAT, the final non-stable token within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.
 
Lucie, the marketing lead for Shiba Inu, detailed the plans for TREAT in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). These announcements come at a critical juncture as the ecosystem prepares for the deployment of its layer-3 blockchain, expected to commence with a testnet phase in the third quarter of this year. The mainnet launch will follow, contingent on the successful completion of rigorous testing and auditing procedures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto.com has postponed its planned launch of an app in  
South Korea due to scrutiny by the regulators on the exchange's anti-money laundering  
practices. According to a local media publication Segye Ilbo, Korean financial  
authorities have initiated an emergency on-site inspection of the crypto exchange.
Anti-Money Laundering Concerns
The inspection, conducted by the Financial  
Intelligence Unit (FIU) under the Financial Services Commission, followed the  
discovery of anti-money laundering-related issues in the data submitted by  
Crypto.com.
Crypto.com has emphasized its commitment to  
maintaining proper anti-money laundering standards, according to a report by  
Coindesk. The firm mentioned that it adheres to the "highest"  
standards. However, it intends to postpone the launch of its app to  
ensure that Korean regulators are fully apprised of its policies, procedures,  
systems, and controls. 
The exchange had announced plans to launch a domestic  
mobile application facilitating coin trading on the 29th. According to the firm,  
the service promises competitive pricing and support for various virtual asset  
transactions. Crypto.com obtained approvals to operate in South  
Korea in 2022. However, regulatory hurdles have proved challenging for  
the crypto exchange.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Late last Friday night, his bet almost hit on the very first halving block, a 40.751 BTC stunner. 
Ironically, miners were the big winners at this turn of the epoch, netting just over 100 million dollars in total revenue on the day — almost five times the previous all-time high.

This unprecedented streak has propelled IBIT into the top 10 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the longest daily inflow run, putting it in league with industry heavyweights. But is IBIT’s success a sign of a resurgent Bitcoin or simply a fad capitalizing on current market trends?
 
 
Bitcoin ETF Landscape Redefined

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-enters-top-10-for-longest-inflows"/>
        <updated>2024-04-23T13:06:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, is now one of the top 10 ETFs of all-time, at least when it comes to maintaining its streak of daily investment inflows.
As of Tuesday, April 23, IBIT has seen 70 days of inflows, meaning that the fund has seen a positive increase in its total holdings of the underlying asset, in this case spot Bitcoin. IBIT has yet to see a day of outflows, in which its holdings have declined.
This milestone comes after a series of US Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals earlier this year, which have proven to be hugely successful.
Since their launch, US Bitcoin ETFs have crossed an impressive $200 billion in total cumulative volume, demonstrating the high demand for Bitcoin among investors. 
BlackRock's CEO, Larry Fink, has notably changed his stance on Bitcoin recently. The company now holds more than 270,000 bitcoins, worth over $18 billion, solidifying its position as a major player in Bitcoin ETFs. This shift in attitude from one of the world's largest asset managers is a testament to the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset.

This comes after Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg tweet yesterday, "$IBIT inflow streak currently at 69 DAYS. one more day and it moves into Top 10 and ties $JETS." 
This achievement highlights the consistent demand for IBIT and its ability to attract a steady stream of investment.
The success of IBIT and other US Spot Bitcoin ETFs sends a positive signal to other countries and traditional investors, demonstrating the high demand for Bitcoin investment products. 
The increasing involvement of major institutional players like BlackRock is a clear indication that Bitcoin is here to stay and will play an increasingly important role in the global financial landscape.]]></summary>
