        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency analyst Nate Geraci has revealed that a rejection of a Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the SEC could lead to a significantly negative effect on the entire cryptocurrency market.
 
Bitcoin Spot ETF Denial To Impact The Crypto Space
 
Nate Geraci took to his official X (formerly Twitter) handle to share his optimism on the impact of a Bitcoin Spot ETF if rejected. The analyst’s recent prediction came amidst the recent bearish sentiment encompassing the crypto asset and market.
 
According to him, if the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denies a Bitcoin Spot ETF, it could lead to a major rug pull in cryptocurrency. He asserted that if an ETF is not approved in January, the rug pull will be one of the “bigger rug pulls” in crypto history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Worldcoin, the iris biometric crypto project, has reportedly reached an agreement with Kenyan authorities which allows it to resume operations in the African country. Worldcoin representatives are said to be “working directly with regulators to meet Kenya’s requirements.”
 
Worldcoin to Restart Kenyan Iris Scanning in Early 2024
 
According to a report, Worldcoin representatives may have reached an agreement with Kenyan authorities which allows the iris biometric cryptocurrency project to resume operations under new guidelines. The report, which cites unnamed sources, said this is likely to happen sometime in early 2024.
 
The claim that Worldcoin is set to resume distributing its WLD tokens to users who agree to have their eyeballs scanned comes just a few months after Kenyan authorities suspended such activities. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, Kenyan regulators were adamant that Worldcoin did not have the necessary license to carry out its activities in the East African country.
 
 
Following the suspension, Worldcoin representatives visited Kenya where they made an appearance before the country’s legislative body. However, according to a Citizen Digital report, Worldcoin may have satisfied concerns initially raised by regulators.
 
“Worldcoin is working directly with regulators to meet Kenya’s requirements, particularly as the Assembly considers new regulations. Stipends will remain and will expand to locations across the country,” the unnamed source reportedly said.
 
The report, however, did not reveal when the Kenyan parliament is expected to pass new data regulations which will guide entities like Worldcoin.

Bitcoin Miners Earn $9.98 Million In A Single Day
 
According to data from Dune Analytics, Bitcoin miners earned over $9.98 million on December 16 as fees from Ordinal inscriptions. This record eclipses the previous one achieved on May 8, 2023, when miners earned over $7.21 million. 
 
 
It is, however, worth mentioning that there has been a substantial increase in BTC’s price since May 8, which could explain the rise in the dollar value. Miners receive these fees to inscribe digital assets (Ordinals) on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals are casua…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the wake of a substantial increase in onchain transaction fees for Bitcoin, the compensation to bitcoin miners from inscription-based transfers has hit a record peak in the last 24 hours. An estimated total of $9.97 million was allocated to miners, eclipsing the former high of $7.21 million established on May 8, 2023. 
 
Miners Rake in Record Fees From Ordinals; Inscriptions Fuel 61% of Bitcoin Transactions
 

 
Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions are nearing the significant milestone of 50 million, with around 48,754,694 marked on the blockchain at this moment. As of Dec. 16, 2023, a record-breaking amount was remunerated to miners for Ordinal inscriptions in a single day. Data indicates that on this Saturday, miners received over 235 BTC, marking it the third-highest day in terms of BTC volume, according to Dune Analytics metrics.
 

 

 

 
Yet, this day stood out as the most substantial in the U.S. dollar value of these fees, with miners earning $9.97 million in the 24-hour timeframe. This surpasses the prior peak on May 8, 2023, when miners were compensated $7.21 million for inscription confirmations. On that particular day, miners were rewarded with more than 257 BTC for verifying inscriptions. The higher miner earnings on this recent Saturday can be attributed to the increased value of BTC.
 

 

 

 
On May 8, 2023, BTC’s closing price was at $27,668 per unit, whereas on Dec. 17, its 24-hour price fluctuated between $41,668 and $42,666. From the 48.75 million inscriptions created since Dec. 16, 2022, miners have garnered over 4,084 BTC, equivalent to $170.68 million, for confirming these transactions. On that same day, bitcoin miners processed 638,144 transactions, with 392,574 being inscription-related. This indicates that inscriptions drove 61.51% of all BTC transactions that day.
