        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monero jumped to a one-month high on Friday, as overall sentiment in crypto markets remained largely unchanged. The global market cap is now trading 0.60% higher at the time of writing. Xrp was back in the red in today’s session, as traders continued to secure recent gains.
 
Monero (XMR)
 
Monero (XMR) has been one of today’s biggest gainers, with prices climbing to a four-week high.
 
Following a low of $152.16 on Thursday, XMR/USD raced to a peak of $163.10 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, XMR climbed to its strongest point since February 20, when the token reached a peak of $168.70.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came as monero rose beyond a key resistance level at the $155.00 mark.
 
Earlier momentum has somewhat eased, which comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a ceiling at 58.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 58.84, with XMR marginally lower than its earlier high. It is now trading at $160.65.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, extended declines on Friday, as traders continued to secure profits following recent highs.
 
XRP/USD dropped to a bottom of $0.4246 in today’s session, which comes a day after a peak at $0.4536.
 
Today’s drop comes three days after XRP hit a peak at $0.4940, which was its strongest point since last November.
 
 
This latest decline comes as the RSI fell below a ceiling at the 64.00 mark, and is now tracking at 57.31.
 
Despite the slip in sentiment, bulls rejected a breakout from a floor of $0.4250, with XRP now trading at $0.4264.
 
There will likely be another attempt to push prices under this mark, however should this point of support hold, there could be a reversal during the weekend.

This time, DOJ is investigating two Swiss financial firms, Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS Group AG, to check whether the financial channels helped Russian users evade implied sanctions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum fell from a 7-month high March 24, as traders reacted to further uncertainty within the European banking sector. Shares in Deutsche Bank fell by as much as 13% in today’s session, following a spike in the cost of credit default swaps. Bitcoin briefly moved above $28,000 on the news. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was back above $28,000 on Friday, as fears of further banking collapses pushed traders towards cryptocurrencies.
 
Following a low of $27,359.25 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $28,729.84 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move came as the cost of insuring against a bank default spiked, leading to a resurgence of market uncertainty.

Overall, BTC has since slipped from earlier highs. However, prices are still higher than Thursday’s bottom.
 
As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $27,658.96, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) dropped below a key floor at 65.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 64.15, with the next visible point of support at the 60.00 mark.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) briefly traded above the $1,800 level in today’s session, prior to colliding with a key resistance level.
 
ETH/USD rose to a peak of $1,853.89 late on Friday, which came following a prior low of $1,745.02.
 
This surge sent ETH to its strongest point since last August, pushing prices marginally above a ceiling at $1,850 in the process.

ETH bulls were unable to sustain this breakout, which has since given way to bears looking to short the market.
 
At the time of writing, ethereum is trading at $1,761.72, with the momentum of the moving averages still upwards facing.
 
This sentiment may soon shift, should the RSI break out of a floor at 56.00. The index is currently tracking at 56.62.
