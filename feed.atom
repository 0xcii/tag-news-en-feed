A version of this article was originally printed in the first issue of Bitcoin Magazine in Ukrainian, which can be purchased here.
When Serhiy Tron was born in 1984, his home city was known as Dniprodzerzhynsk, named for the founder of the Bolshevik secret police in the ’30s. In 2016, it returned to its historic moniker of Kamianske following a country-wide rejection of Communist suppression, but no matter what the city has been called, it has been the kind of industrial center that powers a country and forges resilient and hardworking people.

Unfortunately, this system also enables criminals to evade authorities, especially when transferring money obtained from illegal means. That’s why many regulators in different countries pursue stringent Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws and Know Your Customer (KYC) measures.
 
 
But it seems that setting up these laws is not enough if crypto exchanges don’t do their part in enforcing them. A recent report has revealed that some crypto exchanges in Russia accepted a money laundering run to take USDT and give GBP cash in London.
