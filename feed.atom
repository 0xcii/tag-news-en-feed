Opportunistic Traders Paid a Heavy Price
According to Coinglass data, opportunistic traders opened over 500 million in futures positions within ten minutes of the first tweet from the compromised X (formerly Twitter) account of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, about $50 million in long positions and about $36 million in short positions were liquidated with the price swings, showcasing the possibility of market manipulation risks.
