Orrick in San Francisco found the SEC’s argument that certain crypto tokens sold on Kraken’s platform constitute “investment contracts” and therefore securities subject to the agency’s oversight to be “plausible.”
 
The ruling denies Kraken’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit, which was filed in November 2022. Judge Orrick stated in his opinion:
