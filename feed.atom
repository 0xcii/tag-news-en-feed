Snowden’s statement came in the wake of a significant market disruption that saw Berkshire Hathaway shares plummet by 99% due to a technical glitch on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This incident has reignited discussions about the robustness and reliability of traditional financial systems versus decentralized alternatives.

Statistically, the longer an investor holds their coins, the less likely they become to sell them. As the STHs are the new entrants in the market, they are unlikely to hold for too long.
