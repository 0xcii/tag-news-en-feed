These include reaching the highest level of difficulty, achieving an all-time high in total hashrate, and setting a new record for daily confirmed transactions.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Grown Throughout 2023
 
In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how the supplies of Bitcoin long-term holders and short-term holders have changed over the year 2023.
 
These two investor groups make up the two main divisions of the BTC sector. The short-term holders (STHs) are the participants who bought within the last 155 days, while the long-term holders (LTHs) are those who have held longer than that.
 
 
Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell the coins at any point. As such, the STHs are generally considered the weak-minded hands …]]></summary>

One of the most important use cases of Bitcoin is, as many users of a certain privacy wallet would say, “To make the transactions they don’t want you to make.” Censorship resistance. Financial institutions, and indirectly governments through the coercive influence they exert over those institutions, hold a large degree of control over society and the economy by having the ability to deny people access to financial services and the ability to transact in markets they deem unacceptable.

Bitcoin’s current oscillators offer a diverse perspective. The relative strength index (RSI) at 59, Stochastic at 52, commodity channel index (CCI) at 31, average directional index at 34, and awesome oscillator at 2075 all signal neutrality and a positive trend, suggesting a market in balance. However, the momentum indicator points to bullish action at -1016, contrasting the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) level’s bearish signal at 1115, highlighting a market at a crossroads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Financial Conduct Authority has issued a notice  
against the crypto lending platform Celsius for alleged failure in regulatory  
compliance. This notice, dated December 20, 2023, marks a critical turn in the  
company's operations since it filed for bankruptcy last year. 
The FCA's decision to cancel Celsius' approval stems  
from multiple significant reasons. According to the financial watchdog, Celsius  
failed to prudently conduct its affairs and maintain sound business practices.  
In a notice seen by Finance Magnates, the regulator has canceled the company's  
permission to offer regulated services. 
Financial Non-Compliance and Lack of Cooperation
A substantial portion of the authority's decision is  
linked to Celsius' failure to clear an overdue balance amounting to £1,561.64  
owed to the authority. This outstanding sum, comprising various regulatory fees  
and levies from past periods, remained unpaid despite repeated requests.
