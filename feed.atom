        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum network, made some interesting comments during a recent interview. One of them was his revelation of the worst thing that usually happens on the Ethereum network.
 
The Worst Thing That Happens On Ethereum
 
Vitalik mentioned that the worst thing that happens on Ethereum is when people lose money. It is, however, worth mentioning that this particular comment came in relation to his earlier remarks about the impact that wars and dictators have on human lives. This was meant to be light-hearted in comparison to the “heavy things” he had just spoken about.
 
 
Meanwhile, Vitalik is of the opinion that crypto has a major role to play in any bid to curb the excesses of those in power. He said that crypto can “counter-pressure” the powers of these gove…]]></summary>

Following a reflective look at his past forecasts, Deutscher shared a thread on X, outlining what he believes will be the key trends and shifts in the crypto sphere for the coming year.
 
Deutscher began his revelation by acknowledging the mixed accuracy of his previous predictions for 2023. He candidly remarked, “Exactly one year ago, at the outset of 2023, I published a thread outlining my crypto predictions for the year. Looking back, I got a lot right – but also a lot wrong.” He highlighted his successful predictions for Coinbase, SOL, and BTC while admitting to miscalculations regarding ETH and being overly pessimistic about the market’s first half in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Orbit Bridge, an inter-blockchain bridging protocol, has confirmed that it was recently exploited, losing over $81.5 million in several assets, including USDT, DAI, USDC, WBTC, and ETH. Orbit Chain is trying to communicate with the group responsible for the attack and has asked cryptocurrency exchanges to freeze stolen assets. 
Orbit Bridge Hacked, Losses Registered for Over $81.5 Million
In one of the first hacks of 2024, Orbit Bridge, an interoperability blockchain solution, faced an attack that drained over $81.5 million in cryptocurrency assets. First detected by X user Kgjr, who alerted about a possible asset drain, the incident allowed hackers to withdraw $30 million in USDT, $10 million in USDC and DAI, in addition to almost 231 WBTC and 9,500 ETH, to five different fresh wallets.
Orbit Chain’s team has acknowledged the incident and is trying to contact the attackers, sending two messages with undisclosed intentions. In the same way, Orbit announced that it requested the help of all major exchanges to freeze these funds.
On X, Orbit declared:
We are in close contact with law enforcement agencies, and we are working diligently to track down and freeze the assets that have been stolen.
Due to the method used, X sleuth Tay has linked this hack with the work of North Korean hackers, alerting that 2024 might be a year of billion of dollars in incidents linked to these groups. Orbit has acknowledged the possibility of this link, explaining that “following a thorough review of the claim, an appropriate response plan will be developed.”
Orbit also called for users to be vigilant against scams that promise to refund and reimburse any losses caused by the hack, clarifying that any new information regarding this incident will be shared through appropriate channels.
Recent reports revealed that at least $1.7 billion was lost in this kind of incident during 2023.

Stake.com Gains F1 Team’s Naming Rights
Now known as Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber, the partnership with the crypto platform came after the F1 team competed under the Alfa Romeo name for five racing seasons. From 2026, the F1 team will be rebranded as Audi’s factory team.
“Last season represented the start of Stake’s journey in Formula 1, and the brand’s new role headlining Stake F1 Team represents the natural and exciting next step on this path,” said Sauber’s Team Representative, Alessandro Alunni Bravi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission may approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, according to recent speculations that rocked the digital asset market. Due to these conjectures, Bitcoin surged to over 6% on the second day of 2024, breaking beyond $45,000 for the first time since early April 2022.
 
The excitement surrounding the ETF clearance suggested that Bitcoin will soon be institutionally and widely accepted, which in turn spurred a spike in traders’ and investors’ buying attitude.
 
Predictions that the SEC will approve the introduction of many spot bitcoin ETFs seem to be driving the increase, as they have been doing for the last few weeks.

At $45,355, the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency in the world experienced a 4.3% increase, reaching its highest level since April 6, 2022. Other tokens saw gains as well; Ether, the second-largest, increased by 2.6%.
 
As a result of the change, Bitcoin is still 34% away from its peak of $69,000 in November 2021.
 
Anticipation On Bitcoin ETF Approval Fuels Rally
 
The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s expected approval of numerous spot bitcoin ETF launches, as has been the case for some weeks, seems to be driving the price increase.

An approval by the end of today seems rather unlikely, although the latest surge in the Bitcoin price shows that market participants are of a different opinion.
 
Eleanor Terrett, a journalist for FOX Business, shared insights on the situation via X (formerly known as Twitter), noting the unpredictable nature of the SEC’s decision-making process. She remarked, “While the SEC is surely unpredictable, it would surprise me if approvals were to happen tomorrow.”
