Dogecoin Whale Offloads 86 Million DOGE
 
On-chain data shows that the crypto trader deposited 86 million DOGE into the crypto exchange Robinhood in an effort to profit from the meme coin’s recent price surge. The whale, however, looks to be bullish on the meme coin in the long term, as they have since repurchased a significant amount of DOGE and still hold a substantial amount of it. 
 
Meanwhile, due to the size of such a sale, the price of Dogecoin has since dipped and is currently on a downward trend. Before now, Dogecoin and other meme coins had led other altcoin…]]></summary>
