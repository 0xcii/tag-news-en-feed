        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to institutional-grade research firm Bernstein analysts, Bitcoin (BTC) reaching $200,000 by the end of 2025 would be a “conservative” estimate.
 
Bitcoin To $200,000 By 2025 End?
 
Although BTC remains range-bound, just below its all-time high (ATH) of $73,737, analysts at Bernstein believe their current price prediction of $200,000 for the digital asset by the end of 2025 is conservative.
 
 
In a client note shared today, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani wrote, “Bitcoin is going to $200,000 this cycle,” emphasizing the significance of the asset’s limited supply of 21 million, particularly in light of inflating US debt levels. He added:

Litecoin Transaction Volume Has Been Rising Recently
 
In a new post on X, Jay Milla, the director of marketing at Litecoin Foundation, has pointed out that the LTC network has witnessed a large amount of transaction volume during the past week. The “transaction volume” here refers to an on-chain metric that keeps track of the total amount of Litecoin that’s becoming involved in transactions on the network every day.
 
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means the users are moving around large amounts on the blockchain. Such a trend implies the trading interest in the asset is high among the investors.
