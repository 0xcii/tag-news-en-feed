But what of this Reuters report and others that says it was banned?
Let’s have a closer look.
Yes, network hashrate dropped from 179.2 EH/s to 87.7 EH/s (a 51.1% drop) seemingly confirming that China banned mining.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
After all, China was according to Cambridge 46% of global hashrate the month prior to the “ban” (April 2021). So the figures roughly tally up with the thesis that “mining has been banned in China.”

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 5, 2024
  
  
  
The firm reported owning $211 million in Fidelity's spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) and $253 million in BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), totaling $464 million. Capula's significant investment in Bitcoin ETFs reflects a further growing acceptance of Bitcoin among traditional financial institutions.
This investment aligns with a broader trend of institutional adoption, as more firms seek exposure to the potential upside of BTC. The SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has made it easier for institutions to invest in Bitcoin, providing a more accessible and regulated vehicle for participation in this burgeoning market.
And despite Bitcoin's recent plunge from $67,500 to $49,000, large institutions continue to show confidence in Bitcoin. Data from Arkham indicates that major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and MicroStrategy are not selling their Bitcoin holdings, and are likely buying more.
