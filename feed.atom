        <updated>2024-07-09T13:11:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) has announced, in a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, that her re-election campaign now accepts cryptocurrency donations. This move comes as Blackburn's campaign recently launched a page dedicated to Bitcoin donations.
“Our campaign is committed to meeting supporters where they are,” said Senator Blackburn. “As a growing number of Americans utilize digital currencies for everyday transactions, we are excited to take this next step and stay on the cutting edge of the 21st-century digital world.”
This announcement follows a recent trend of Bitcoin adoption among U.S. politicians. Just yesterday, Blackburn chaired the RNC Platform Committee that passed their 2024 platform draft, committing to defend the right to mine and self-custody Bitcoin. Congressman Matt Gaetz recently introduced a bill allowing federal income tax payments in Bitcoin. Additionally, former President Donald Trump also started accepting Bitcoin Lightning payments for campaign donations.
Earlier this year, Senator Blackburn told Bitcoin Magazine that the freedom and privacy aspects of Bitcoin are a "very good thing", while advocating strongly against central bank digital currencies (CBDC), saying they are spy tools for the government to use against their citizens.

Senator Blackburn is also set to speak at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville at the end of the month, further signaling her support for Bitcoin.

Gox’s recent Bitcoin transfers have continued to cause concerns for the crypto community, considering the amount of selling pressure they could place on the flagship crypto. However, Cryptoquant’s founder, Ki Young Ju, has helped to ease these concerns, recently explaining why these transactions might not affect the market. 
 
Why Mt Gox’s 47,000 BTC Move Won’t Affect Bitcoin’s Price
 
In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Ki Young Ju outlined three possible scenarios for Mt Gox’s Bitcoin transactions to explain why it won’t affect its price. First, he stated that these Bitcoin transactions may have simply been an internal transfer, with the defunct crypto exchange switching wallets for security reasons. 
 
 
Secondly, he mentioned that the transaction might have bee…]]></summary>

cryptocurrency industry faced a barrage of security breaches in the second  
quarter of 2024, with total losses reaching $629.7 million across 49 incidents,  
according to a new report from blockchain security firm Cyvers. Despite the  
staggering figure, only 24% of stolen funds were recovered, highlighting the  
persistent challenges in safeguarding digital assets.
Since the  
beginning of the year, cryptocurrency criminals have seized over $1.38 billion, most of which resulted from "access control breaches."

The report

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia's leading stock exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), has approved listing the second Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on its platform.

BREAKING: 🇦🇺 Australia’s largest stock exchange has approved its second spot #Bitcoin ETF. pic.twitter.com/SY5vIGEm4a
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 9, 2024
  
  
  
On July 9th, the ASX gave the green light to digital asset manager DigitalX to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF. The new ETF will begin trading on July 12th under the ticker BTXX.
This comes just weeks after the ASX approved its first Bitcoin ETF in June when it listed the VanEck Bitcoin ETF. The moves follow the successful debut of several Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. beginning in early 2024.
Australia has been building momentum in Bitcoin ETFs over the past year. The country's first spot Bitcoin ETF, the 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (EBTC), launched in April 2022 and trades on the Cboe Australia exchange.
Most recently, in June, the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) also began trading on the Cboe. Now, ASX is following suit by approving its second Bitcoin ETF after VanEck's product became the first last month.
The flurry of new Bitcoin investment vehicles hitting the Australian market reflects the growing interest in Bitcoin exposure. Investors are increasingly looking to gain Bitcoin exposure through regulated fund structures rather than direct ownership.
ETFs provide an easy avenue to invest in the asset class without needing to custody Bitcoin directly. Many expect more countries to approve Bitcoin ETFs as the instruments gain traction and regulatory acceptance expands.
By greenlighting another Bitcoin ETF, Australia's main securities exchange demonstrates a favourable shift in attitudes toward Bitcoin assets within one of the world's top financial markets.]]></summary>

 In detail, Bybit–which is headquartered in Singapore and was founded in 2018–has, from October last year to this June, seen its market share double from 8% to 16%, while Binance’s share has dropped over the same time period from 60% to 54%.
