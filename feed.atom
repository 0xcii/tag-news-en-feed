The sentencing took place on Tuesday in a New York federal court, where Judge Lewis Kaplan also ordered Ellison to forfeit $11 billion for her role in the massive fraud that led to the downfall of FTX, once valued at $32 billion.
 
FTX Collapse Claims Another Inmate
 
According to a CNBC report, the two-year prison term was notably harsher than the recommendation from the federal Probation Department, which had suggested a sentence of three years of supervised release without incarceration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[China’s recent stimulus measures have sparked optimism in the global financial markets, and according to QCP Capital analysts, the effects may soon extend to the cryptocurrency space.
 
While stock indices responded positively to China’s economic policies, the crypto market has yet to see a similar surge. However, QCP Capital believes the next phase of stimulus from China’s central bank could fuel bullish sentiment in risk assets, including crypto.
 
 
Potential For Crypto Market Upsurge
 
In a post uploaded earlier today on its Telegram channel, QCP Capital noted that the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is expected to roll out additional stimulus, which, combined with easing from other major central banks, could inject more liquidity into global markets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) could benefit from the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) decision to cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50 basis points (bps).
 
China Injects Economic Stimulus, Will Bitcoin Benefit?
 
In an announcement on September 24, 2024, the Chinese central bank stated it had slashed the RRR by 50bps. The move bears semblance to a similar step taken by the US Federal Reserve on September 18, when it initiated interest rate cuts with 50bps. 
 
According to cryptocurrency analyst Jamie Coutts, reducing RRR by 50bps will add $113 billion of liquidity to the Chinese equity market. This fresh liquidity could effectively establish a “stock stabilization fund,” potentially lowering borrowing costs on approximately $5.3 trillion in mortgages.
