Tron Leads In P2P Stablecoin Transfers
 
While the network was first known for hosting gaming dapps due partly to its high scalability and low fees, it has evolved over the years. Taking to X, the analyst argues that Tron plays a critical role in banking the unbanked and the underserved in developing economies.
 
 
In a post, the analyst notes that Tron has been steadily and gradually carving out a niche by prioritizing the processing of trustless peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. However, it is a divergence from what other platforms, including …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent discussion within the XRP community has reignited speculation surrounding the token’s future price trajectory. The catalyst for this discussion was a bold prediction made by Crypto Tank, a prominent crypto analyst. He suggested that XRP could reach a $100 price target if it captures 10% of the daily transaction volume handled by SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.
 
XRP’s Ambitious $100 Price Target: A Deep Dive
 
To provide context, SWIFT processed approximately $5 trillion in daily transactions as of June 2022. If XRP were to secure 10% of this volume, it would equate to handling roughly $500 billion in daily transactions. This significant increase in transaction volume could potentially drive a substantial rise in XRP’s price.
