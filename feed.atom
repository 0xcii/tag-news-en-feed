Doede Osman Khan, a 50-year-old from Shropshire, UK, boasted about helping investors evade online scams and promised them lucrative investment returns. However, the reality was far more sinister, as Khan siphoned thousands from unsuspecting individuals, not just in the UK but as far away as Canada.
 
 
Khan’s Web Of Deception
 
Khan began operations in early 2019 under the alias “Danny Turner.” Khan lured potential investors by offering tutorials on buying and trading cryptocurrencies, quickly amassing many customers worldwide.

The approval of an Ethereum ETF would no doubt be one of such events, which is why these October dates are important to keep in mind.
 
First Ethereum ETF Approval Decision Coming Up
 
After firms have been able to finalize their filings for Ethereum ETFs with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ball is now in the court of the regulator. Depending on the dates on which the ETF filings were made, their decision dates are either closer or farther away, but the first one is less than two weeks away.

office. 
Lam's abrupt severance of his connection with JPEX comes in the  
wake of his arrest earlier this week, along with 10 others, all linked to an  
alleged conspiracy to defraud investors. The case in question involves a staggering HK$1.37

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Peak Mining, a subsidiary of Northern Data Group, the company has signed a contract with bitcoin mining rig manufacturer Microbt worth $150 million. This agreement will equip Peak Mining with 7 exahash per second (EH/s) of the latest next-generation BTC mining devices.
 
Microbt and Northern Data’s Peak Mining Strike $150M Deal, Focus on Liquid-Cooling Advancement
 

 
On Friday, Peak Mining, a firm under the Northern Data Group umbrella, announced its purchase of $150 million in Microbt Whatsminer machines. The acquisition includes the Whatsminer M53S+, M53S++, M50S+ and M50S++ models. The company noted the possibility of buying an additional $150 million in hardware down the road.
 

 
Through this purchase, Peak indicated it will be among the pioneers to introduce “liquid-cooling mining technology at this scale.” The first shipment of these liquid-cooled Microbt miners is expected in October 2023, with installation set for North Dakota.
 

 
“The new contract will significantly increase our self-mining capacity and prepares our existing portfolio for the upcoming halving,” Niek Beudeker, the managing director at Peak Mining commented. “We choose to deploy hardware in a higher performance output mode at purpose-built next-generation infrastructure,” Beudeker added.
 

 

 

 
Peak Mining’s announcement comes on the heels of Microbt’s revelation of a new miner, the M60 series, slated for an October release. The mining rig that Microbt intends to introduce boasts an efficiency rating of 1X joules per terahash (J/T). Even as cryptocurrency markets remain consolidated and lackluster, the mining sector continues its brisk pace, with the top three mining rig manufacturers launching machines with enhanced efficiency metrics.

The company aims to expand its foothold over the European market and increase its trading volume by offering crypto derivatives to more clients.
 
 
Coinbase Pounders Acquisition As Spot Crypto Trading Volume Crashes
 
The report claims that Coinbase has been trying to acquire FTX Europe on at least two occasions. The first was in late 2022, when the parent company, FTX, filed for bankruptcy protection in the US, and recently in September 2023.
 
Speaking about the possibility of buying FTX Europe, a spokesperson for the US crypto exchange told Fortune:
 

We’re always evaluating opportunities to strategically expand our business and meet with many teams around the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitmain, a leading bitcoin mining rig manufacturer, has introduced the newest addition to its Antminer products: the S21 series. The newest models have an efficiency rating under 20 joules per terahash (J/T) and produce between 200 terahash per second (TH/s) and 335 TH/s.
 
Bitmain Launches 2 New Antminers; Invests $54M in Core Scientific
 
At the 2023 World Digital Mining Summit in Hong Kong, Bitmain showcased its latest rigs from the Antminer S21 series. One machine employs hydro mining, and the other is air-cooled.
 
The S21 Hyd achieves up to 335 TH/s with an efficiency rating of 16 J/T. In contrast, the air-cooled S21 miner delivers up to 200 TH/s and has an efficiency rating around 17.5 J/T.
 
The Bitmain announcement comes after Canaan introduced its new Avalon miners. However, only one of them, the liquid cooling machine, has a 19.5 J/T efficiency, while Canaan’s air-cooled miner reaches 21.5 J/T.
 

 
Additionally, competitor Microbt aims to launch a machine with an efficiency under 20 J/T. Bitmain’s newest hydro-cooled rig contends with Microbt’s hydro-cooled M53S++ in hashrate. Nevertheless, its efficiency rating of 16 J/T outperforms Microbt’s rig, which has 22 J/T.
 
Besides Bitmain’s new rigs, the company has invested $54 million in Core Scientific through a fresh supply contract. Bitmain will deliver 27,000 bitcoin miners to Core Scientific and has entered a hosting agreement with the company.
 
The common stock and cash transaction will provide Core Scientific with Bitmain’s S19J XP Antiminer, which produces 151 TH/s and 21.7 J/T. “We look forward to deepening our strategic relationship with Core Scientific, our long-standing U.S.-based partner,” Max Hua, Bitmain’s CEO remarked.

Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced that Citadel Securities has settled  
charges of violating Regulation SHO, a law aimed at controlling  
short-selling practices. This violation pertained to Citadel Securities'  
alleged failure to accurately mark sale orders as long, short, or short exempt.  

The SEC's investigation  
revealed a pattern of mismarked orders over five years, attributing  
these inaccuracies to a coding error within Citadel Securities' automated  
trading system. During this time, the  
firm mistakenly classified short sales as long sales and vice versa. Even more  
concerning to the SEC was that Citadel provided this erroneous data

Bitcoin Non-Whale Addresses Have Increased Their Supply Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, a shift has occurred in the BTC market during the last few months. The indicator of interest here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total percentage of the Bitcoin supply the different investor groups hold.
 
Addresses or holders are divided into these groups based on the total number of coins they currently carry in their wallets. For example, the 1 to 10 coins cohort includes all investors that own at least 1 and at most 10 BTC.

This new currency is so young and so different from the usual dollars and euros, that for most people it seems disconnected from the economic reality and even further - from their lives.

There is definitely a psychological barrier to Bitcoin adoption.
To lower this barrier, what can be better than associating Bitcoin with something that is widely acknowledged and cherished? Something with a reputation that speaks for itself, capable of pulling Bitcoin from its shadow of “internet speculation” and propelling it into the realm of legit alternative money?..
