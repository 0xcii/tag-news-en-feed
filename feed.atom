        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, large Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin reported a significant security breach resulting in the loss of 4,502.9 BTC, currently valued at over $300 million. The incident occurred at approximately 1:26 p.m. and involved unauthorized access to the exchange's wallet.
In an official statement, DMM Bitcoin said that measures have been taken to prevent further unauthorized access by imposing restrictions on certain services in attempt to enhance security. These restrictions include suspending new account openings, processing cryptocurrency withdrawals, and accepting new buying orders for spot trading. However, existing limit orders and withdrawals of Japanese Yen may experience delays.
DMM Bitcoin said that it is committed to fully guaranteeing all customer Bitcoin deposits. "Please rest assured that all of your Bitcoin (BTC) deposits will be fully guaranteed as we will procure the equivalent amount of BTC that was leaked with support from our group companies," the announcement stated.
The exchange says they "deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused to our customers," and is actively investigating the details of the breach. DMM Bitcoin says it will provide updates as more information becomes available.

As the founder of BitInstant, one of the earliest and most influential Bitcoin exchanges, Shrem played a pivotal role in the early adoption of Bitcoin. However, his arrest in 2014 for money laundering linked to Silk Road transactions marked a significant turning point. 

The Rise of BitInstant
Charlie Shrem discovered Bitcoin during his senior year of college and quickly saw its potential as a revolutionary form of money that promised personal freedom, autonomy, and privacy. In 2011, he co-founded BitInstant with Gareth Nelson, creating a platform that made it easier for people to buy and sell Bitcoin during a time when such transactions w…]]></summary>

The decisions are National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo (NRA) and Cantero, et al. v. Bank of America, N. A. (Cantero).
In NRA, the Court addressed a critical issue impacting not only traditional advocacy groups but any disfavored, but legal, industry. This ruling draws parallels to Operation Choke Point 2.0, where U.S. regulators have allegedly been targeting crypto businesses through financial exclusion. Moreover, the recent Cantero decision sheds light on how this legal framework might impact Custodia Bank's appeal against the denial of their master account by the Federal Reserve.

Engaging deeply with two authoritative books, Buterin re-examined the historical nuances of this schism from his unique perspective as both a participant and a thought leader in the crypto space.
 
Buterin’s blog entry, entitled “Some reflections on the Bitcoin block size war,” unpacks the contrasting narratives provided by Jonathan Bier’s The Blocksize War and Roger Ver and Steve Patterson’s Hijacking Bitcoin. These books represent the pro-small-block and pro-big-block viewpoints, respectively, offering a lens into the ideological and technical divides that characterized the debate.
