        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MicroStrategy continues to stack bitcoin, with the help of a sizable discount on a loan taken out at Silvergate Bank.
MicroStrategy has announced the repayment of a $205M bitcoin-collateralized loan in full at a 22% discount for $160M, along with the acquisition of an additional 6,455 BTC, bringing their total holdings to 138,955 BTC.

According to a tweet by Chairman Michael Saylor, the bitcoin was acquired at an average price of ~$29,817 per bitcoin. The loan was through now-collapsed Silvergate Bank, which explains the steep discount on the loan paid off by MicroStrategy.



MicroStrategy continues to have the largest public corporation holdings of bitcoin, with second-in-line Marathon holding more than 100,000 bitcoin less than MicroStrategy. 
MicroStrategy began buying bitcoin back in August 2020, only selling it for the first time in December 2022 for the purpose of tax loss harvesting. Even then, it continued to add to its bitcoin collection, acquiring 2,500 bitcoin shortly after the sale. 
MicroStrategy also recently announced its plans to release enterprise infrastructure services and content monetization solutions using the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Michael Saylor, who was the company’s CEO from its inception, changed his role at the company in August 2022 in order to further focus on the company’s stated mission of advancing Bitcoin adoption and development. 
Today’s news of further acquisition of bitcoin by the company reiterates its belief in the long-term viability of their bitcoin investment, and shows that large entities continue to acquire bitcoin as the price has ramped up in recent weeks.]]></summary>

American journalist Charles Gasparino insists that Wall Street’s “low-rate” junkies are ignoring the U.S. banking crisis. Quill Intelligence CEO Danielle DiMartino Booth asserts that the banking industry is facing problems that “nobody wants to call a banking crisis.”
 
Ignoring the U.S. Bank Crisis

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp moved back towards a five-month high on Monday, as prices surged for a third straight session. The token formerly known as ripple was one of the very few gainers to start the week, as markets mostly consolidated. Polygon edged closer to a multi-week low to start the week.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, rose for a third consecutive session on Monday, as prices neared a five-month high.
 
Following a low of 0.4438 on Sunday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4877 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, XRP moved closer to a recent high of $0.4940, which is the strongest point the token has hit since November 6.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this latest rally comes as the relative strength index (RSI) moved towards a ceiling at 70.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 66.91, and should it pass the 70.00 mark, then XRP will likely hit a fresh multi-month high.
 
A long-term ceiling at the $0.5000 mark could potentially be a target for current bulls in the market.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC), moved lower to start the week, with the token falling towards a recent support point.
 
MATIC/USD fell to a bottom at $1.08, which comes a day after prices were trading at a high of $1.12.
 
Overall, polygon is now on the brink of colliding with the $1.05 floor, which was last hit on March 12.
 
 
From the chart, it looks like a downward cross has taken place between the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
In addition to this, the RSI is now tracking at 43.62, which is marginally above a resistance level of 43.00.
 
Should momentum continue to fall, there is a strong possibility that MATIC will move below $1.00.

Bitcoin Miners Have Spent Almost Equal Number Of Days In Profit As They Have In Loss
 
According to a new report published by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, BTC miners have been enjoying profits recently. To know whether Bitcoin miners are making profits or losses, the difference between their revenue and expenses is taken.
 
The firm defines the “mining revenue” as the sum of the total value of coins that miners are issuing (that is, the BTC they are getting through mining block rewards) and the transaction fees that they are receiving for handling transfers.
 
As for expenses incurred by these chain validators, Glassnode has assumed t…]]></summary>
