Potential Bitcoin Sellers
 
First, Hossainpour drew attention to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has seen its holdings reduce from 621,000 BTC to just under 580,000 BTC since the launch of their spot ETF. The trust’s high annual fee of 1.5 % compared to other providers such as Bitwise (0.2 %) and BlackRock (0.25 %) as well as Grayscale’s history are currently causing a massive sell-off, which is probably responsible for the current downward trend.

Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin has experienced a downward trend, with its value plummeting below the $42,000 mark after briefly touching $48,000 on January 11th.
 
Caution Signals Flash As Crypto Metrics Shift
 
One of the prominent metrics signaling caution is the Fear and Greed Index, which currently stands at 52, reflecting a neutral sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. However, historical patterns indicate that when the index enters the greed zone, a price correction often follows.
