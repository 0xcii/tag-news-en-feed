Court Allows Ripple To File A Sur-Reply
 
Filan stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the court had granted Ripple’s motion to file a Sur-reply, meaning that the crypto firm can now file an additional reply to the SEC’s motion. The Commission had initially filed a motion to compel Ripple to produce certain documents. The crypto firm then filed a response arguing why the court should not grant this motion.

Cramer, known for his sometimes contrarian takes, has taken a cautious stance on Bitcoin’s recent rally. While acknowledging the positive momentum, he expressed concerns about the cryptocurrency’s ability to sustain this upward climb due to potential lack of fresh capital entering the market.

The report acknowledges the recent 20% correction in BTC’s price over the past two weeks, attributing it largely to profit-taking on previous GBTC investments.
