Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has weighed in on the matter, suggesting a potential shift in policy under a Harris administration. Meanwhile, analysts speculate that a return of Donald Trump to the White House could lead to a weaker dollar, which some believe could benefit Bitcoin and other crypto assets.
