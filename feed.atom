        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance has found itself at the center of controversy once more after a stablecoin listing of the AEUR went terribly wrong. The listing of the Anchored Coins EUR (AEUR) has ended with what can only be described as a disaster that has left the exchange’s users with ample losses.
 
The Binance AEUR Saga
 
On Monday, December 4, Binance announced that it would be listing a new stablecoin called the Anchored Coins EUR (AEUR). This was another normal listing that went as planned for the exchange and trading began on the same day.
 
As a way to promote this new stablecoin, the exchange announced zero-fee trading across four AEUR pairs, including AEUR/BTC, AEUR/ETH, AEUR/USDT, and AEUR/EUR. Trading kicked off across all of these pairs on the exchange with volume coming in under $10 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DMG Blockchain Solutions, a bitcoin miner and cryptocurrency technology company, announced that the firm has purchased 4,550 T21 Antminer bitcoin miners from Bitmain Technologies. DMG detailed that it paid $12.1 million for the next-generation application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners which equates to $14 per terahash a second (TH/s).
 
DMG to Expand Fleet With Latest Purchase From Bitmain
 
DMG has revealed it has purchased 4,550 T21 Antminers from Bitmain and it expects to get 1.06 exahash per second (EH/s) from the new units. The firm detailed that the miners cost $12.1 million and were financed through both cash and liquidated bitcoin (BTC). The mining firm is expecting the units to arrive sometime in March 2024.
 
The T21 Antminer produces 190 TH/s but can be overclocked to 233 TH/s, DMG detailed in its announcement. The company aims to ship the miners to the firm’s Christina Lake data center facility. “DMG is planning to utilize its previously purchased mining containers, which are in the process of being installed at its Christina Lake facility in advance of taking delivery of the T21 miners,” the company said in a statement.
 

 
DMG added:
 

This new fleet, in combination with expected rationalization of its existing fleet, will help DMG improve its overall fleet efficiency anticipated to be below 25 J/TH post-halvening, which is expected in April 2024.
 
The news follows several mining operations acquiring ASIC bitcoin mining machines. Iris Energy just recently acquired 7,000 T21 Antminers from Bitmain and Riot Platforms secured 66,560 ASICs or 18 EH/s from Microbt. DMG mined 64.7 BTC in November and by the end of the month, the firm held a total of 429 BTC worth $18,801,182 using prevailing exchange rates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Satoshi Nakamoto is God and Bitcoin’s design is perfect. Or is it? There's one feature of the protocol that keeps bugging me: the Halvening (halving, whatever). I'm sure Naka thought this over. His first Bitcoin must have had an incremental reduction of the supply per block. But the final design, the one we know, cuts the block reward in half only after every 210,000 blocks (every four years). Obviously, this decision had a tremendous impact on price action, volatility, and adoption. Unfortunately, it’s not the best supply scheme. Let's explore.
Halvings
Bitcoin, as we know it, has a supply schedule adhering to the following hard coded rule:

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Ignored The Latest Rally
 
As Glassnode lead on-chain analyst Checkmate explained in a post on X, the old BTC hands aren’t even selling at levels similar to 2019 yet. The relevant indicator here is the “Value Days Destroyed Multiple,” which is based on another metric called the “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD).
 
In on-chain analysis, a coin day represents the amount that 1 BTC accumulates after sitting still on the blockchain for 1 day. When a coin that has been dormant for a while finally moves, its coin days counter would naturally reset back to zero, and the coin days it had been carrying earlier would be “destroyed.”

The dispute centered around hosting and energy agreements between the two parties, with Whinstone seeking damages for alleged unpaid hosting fees and a declaratory judgment asserting its right to terminate these agreements.
Rhodium, not taking the accusations lightly, engaged outside counsel and countered with claims of its own. It sought damages for Whinstone's alleged breaches of certain hosting agreemen…]]></summary>

Despite regulatory bodies categorizing the largest cryptocurrency as a commodity, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler’s comments have once again sparked discussions on whether BTC should be considered a security.
 
On February 27, Chair Gensler commented on the state of the cryptocurrency market, suggesting that “everything but Bitcoin” should be regarded as a security within the nascent crypto industry. 
 
These remarks have triggered Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz to counter a claim made by a Bitcoin maximalis…]]></summary>

Ten years on, what was first created as a “joke” has gone on to become one of the largest cryptocurrencies with a large community to boot. 
 
How Dogecoin Came To Be
 
Engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer created Dogecoin, and interestingly, the duo is said to have created the meme coin as a parody of Bitcoin. It was created at a time when cryptocurrencies were just garnering hype and was done as a way to satirize them. That would explain why the Japanese Shiba Inu dog was chosen as the meme coin’s logo.
 
 
Upon creation, Dogecoin began to gain some ground in the world of cryptocurrencies as it was seen as the fun and less serious crypto token. Many might argue t…]]></summary>

fluctuations, these developments underscore the challenges faced by those  
attempting to profit from potential price reversals.
Market Dynamics: Liquidations on the Rise
The surge in Bitcoin prices has triggered significant liquidations,  
particularly on exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Huobi. Large liquidations, a  
result of traders failing to meet margin requirements, provide crucial signals  
for market shifts. With trading volumes spiking by 25% and open interest

Over the course of history, different monetary systems have risen and fallen as technology progressed and new forms of money emerged that were superior to what came before.
