        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent analysis from EGRAG CRYPTO has captured the attention of the crypto community with an ambitious prediction. The analyst suggests that XRP’s market cap could potentially reach an astounding $3 trillion, a development that would elevate the token into the top tier of digital assets and significantly impact the entire crypto landscape.
 
 
The ‘White Channel’ Benchmark
 
EGRAG CRYPTO bases their prediction on a confluence of technical indicators. They point to a strategic benchmark dubbed “The White Channel” on the XRP chart, suggesting a potential price surge if the token breaches its upper limits. Even reaching the top of this channel would translate to a market cap of nearly $290 billion, a significant jump from its current position.

the popular cryptocurrency Dogecoin, recently passed away at the age of 18. Her owner, Atsuko Sato, announced the news in a

From Meme to Mainstream
Kabosu became an internet icon as the face of  
Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that started as a joke but grew into a major player  
in the digital currency world. Launched in 2013, Dogecoin was a satirical take  
on the burgeoning crypto market, but it gained real traction and value when  
Tesla CEO Elon Musk began tweeting about it in 2020. 
Musk's tweets brought significant attention and

For the uninitiated, Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) involves various techniques used by market actors to capture additional value by exploiting price inefficiencies in blockchain transactions.
One naive form of MEV is called “transaction sniping.”
Most recently, manifestations of this phenomenon have begun populating your local Bitcoin memepools because of ordinals trading. Without going into too much detail, the way on-chain trading currently works is through the use of pre-signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBTs). 
The concept is simple: some users list pictures on a marketplace by crafting a transaction with the details and the price they would like to sell it at. You, a cat aficionado, can purchase this feline grail by completing the transaction, adding to your address, the tra…]]></summary>

Bitcoin To Hit $156,000 By May 2025
 
Cryptorphic mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “Bitcoin could hit $156,000 by May 27, 2025!.” To back up his prediction, he highlighted the flagship crypto’s price action after previous halvings and noted that there has never been a “red year” after these historical events. Instead, BTC is known to have made significant price increases a year after each halving. 
 
 
Bitcoin is said to have recorded an 8,296% price gain a year after the first halving in 2012, a 288% price gain a year after the second halving in 2016, and…]]></summary>

The latest Q1-2024 Hashrate Index Report by Luxor Technology delves into the Bitcoin mining sector's performance after the Fourth Bitcoin Halving.
