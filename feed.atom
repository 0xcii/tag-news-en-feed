        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chainlink rose for a fourth straight day to start the weekend, as the price surged by as much as 7% in today’s session. The move pushed the token to a two-month high, breaking out of a key resistance level in the process. Solana extended recent gains on Saturday. 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) rose by as much as 7% in today’s session, as the token climbed to a two-month peak.
 
LINK/USD raced to an intraday high of $8.21 to start the weekend, which comes a day after falling to a low of $7.69.
 
As a result of the rally, chainlink climbed to its highest level since July 22, when the price peaked at $8.37.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the move occurred after bulls orchestrated a breakout of a ceiling at $8.10.
 
This gain also pushed the relative strength index (RSI) into the overbought region, with a current reading of 74.28.
 
Bears may see this as an opportunity to trigger a price reversal, with a ceiling of 75.00 as a potential entry point.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) remained above the $20.00 level on Saturday, as the token neared a key price point.
 
Following a low of $20.06 on Friday, SOL/USD jumped to a high of $20.42 earlier in the weekend’s session.
 
This saw the cryptocurrency near a ceiling of $20.50, with bulls so far unable to force a breakout beyond this level.
 
 
Earlier gains have since edged lower as a result, with solana now trading at $20.30, with the RSI under a resistance point of its own at 56.00.
 
Price strength now sits at 55.96, with a floor of 53.00 a possible target for bears, in the event momentum continues to weaken this weekend.

As the years roll by, Ulbricht remains in prison, still seeking justice for what he believes was an unfair sentence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated to start the weekend, as traders moved to secure gains following recent highs in the market. The global market cap was largely unchanged on Saturday, trading 0.06% lower at the time of writing. Ethereum also declined, after a one-month high on Friday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin retreated from a ten-day high on Saturday, as bulls opted to secure profits from recent gains.
 
BTC/USD slipped to a low of $26,721.76 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24-hours after peaking at $27,075.94.
 
The move comes as bulls were unable to sustain a recent breakout above a ceiling at the $27,100 level.
 
 
Zooming into the chart, a failed break of the 58.00 resistance level on the relative strength index (RSI), also contributed to the downturn.
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is now tracking at 56.24, which is marginally above a ceiling of 55.00.
 
Bulls will likely make another run towards $27,000 this weekend, despite today’s price consolidation.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) has been on a bull run this week, climbing to a one-month high during Friday’s session.
 
These gains have since been erased, with ETH/USD falling to a low of $1,657.68 earlier in the day, after hitting a high of $1,681.79 the day before.
 
The move has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average on the cusp with a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Although momentum is firmly bullish, a ceiling of 61.00 on the RSI could act as a hurdle for traders looking to take ETH towards $1,700.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 60.01, with ethereum hovering slightly below the $1,680 price region.
