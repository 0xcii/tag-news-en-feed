        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent analysis from Bitcoin Magazine Pro showcases the power of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) in Bitcoin compared to traditional assets like gold, Apple stock, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI). The data reveals that consistently investing $10 weekly into Bitcoin over the last five years would have grown a total investment of $2,620 into $7,913.20, reflecting a remarkable 202.03% return.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
In contrast, the same $10 weekly investment in gold yielded a return of 34.47%, growing the initial $2,620 to $3,523.06. Apple stock also performed well, with a 79.13% return, turning the $2,620 investment into $4,693.13. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones provided the least return, wi…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Magazine covered Silent Payments over two years ago to shed light on one of Bitcoin's shortcomings: privacy. It was a problem then and it still is today...as stated: 
"...a push based payment system (no one is allowed to "pull" payments from you, you have to explicitly authorize them yourself and "push" them to other people), Bitcoin requires the sender to have the information necessary to define the destination for money they send. This requires the recipient communicating to the sender their Bitcoin address in one way or another. In the case of trying to raise money from the general public, this has massive consequences in terms of privac…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) has increased its investment in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a new SEC filing today, as first reported on X by MacroScope. 

In an SEC filing today, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board reported owning 2,898,051 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust as of June 30 (valued at $98.9 million as of that date).
This is an increase from the 2,450,400 shares that Wisconsin previously reported in May.…

As of June 30, the board owns 2,898,051 shares, valued at $98.9 million. This marks a substantial increase of 447,651 shares from the 2,450,400 shares reported in May. Notably, the filing also revealed that the board no longer holds any position in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a change from May when it reported holding 1,013,000 shares. 
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
Earlier this year in May, SWIB became the first state pension to buy spot Bitcoin ETFs, signaling a another big milestone in the integration of Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios. The board's decision to increase its investment in IBIT highlights a growing preference for direct Bitcoin exposure through spot ETFs, reflecting broader institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. 
Despite the recent downward price action in Bitcoin, money continues to pour into the spot Bitcoin ETFs, with a total combined inflow of $243.06 million since July 24.
