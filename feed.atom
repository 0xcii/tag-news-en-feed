        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) confirmed yesterday (Monday) the deletion of Binance Cyprus Ltd from the Register of Service Providers of Crypto-assets as the company did not provide any services under the Cyprot license for more than six months continuously.  

Binance Exits Cyprus  

It is to be noted that Binance, last June, initially moved for the deregistration of its local unit in Cyprus. However, despite holding the license, the crypto exchange giant did not provide any clarification behind keeping the Cypriot entity dormant.  

Binance received the Class 3 registration as a Crypto Asset Services Provider (CASP) from the CySEC in October 2022. At that time, it was one of the many regulatory registrations of the global crypto exchange within the European Union. …]]></summary>

Drawing from his pre-released testimony, Gensler remains unwavering in his belief that the majority of crypto assets fall under the purview of the SEC and should be treated as securities.
 
Gensler will emphasize, “There is nothing about the crypto asset securities markets that suggests that investors and issuers are less deserving of the protections of our securities laws.” He further elaborated on the historical context, noting that Congress, in its 1933 and 1934 securities laws, did not limit the definition of securities to just stocks and bonds.

        <updated>2023-09-12T06:13:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The decentralized crypto exchange Sushi is expanding to the Aptos blockchain. The team noted that the move marks Sushi’s first expansion onto a non-EVM blockchain.
 
From Ethereum to Aptos
 
Sushi is a decentralized exchange (dex) and automated market maker (AMM) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade crypto assets and provide liquidity in return for rewards. Launched on August 28, 2020, The dex also has a native governance token called SUSHI.
 
“By leveraging Aptos’s Move programming language, Sushi is initially introducing its v2 Automated Market Maker (AMM), with more integrations to come,” Sushi said in its announcement. The Sushi team believes the Aptos integration will unlock deeper cross-chain liquidity and elevate the trading experience across chains.
 
Aptos is a new layer one (L1) blockchain focused on scalability and claims to provide reliability, security, and usability. Its Move programming language enables developers to build Web3 applications in a different fashion. As a non-EVM chain, Aptos represents new territory for Sushi, the developers remarked.
 
 
According to the announcement, “This expansion to Aptos not only unlocks a new level of deep liquidity across major blockchain networks but also significantly elevates the cross-chain trading experience.” Sushi’s team insists the decision will strengthen its leading cross-chain position by spreading to Aptos.
 
Sushi was once a top dex but volume has dropped considerably over the past few years. Defillama.com statistics show that the dex platform has $347.23 million total value locked across various protocols. Sushi’s TVL has also lost a great deal of value since November 2021, after holding more than $8 billion.

        <updated>2023-09-12T04:12:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase Cloud and blockchain infrastructure company Kiln are now allowing ethereum (ETH) users to stake any amount of ether natively. The new offering removes the previous 32 ETH minimum staking requirement.
 
Staking for All: Coinbase Cloud and Kiln Break Down Minimum Barriers
 
With the integration of Kiln’s onchain staking platform, Coinbase Cloud and its clients can enable partial ETH staking. This allows wallet providers like Coinbase Wallet to give users the ability to earn staking rewards without needing to meet minimums. The press announcement notes that over 99 percent of ether wallets hold less than the 32 ETH previously required to stake on the network.
 
“We are thrilled to have worked with Coinbase Cloud and to welcome them as the first (non-Kiln) node operator leveraging the Kiln Onchain Staking Platform,” said Kiln CEO Laszlo Szabo. The Kiln CEO added:
 
 
This integration with Coinbase Cloud is unique because it allows them to enable other wallets and services, including [decentralized exchanges], with the same limitless [ether] staking solution that will be offered by Coinbase Wallet.
 
 
 
Partial ETH staking builds on Coinbase Cloud’s existing staking infrastructure. The company said its multi-cloud, multi-region setup ensures reliability alongside trusted security standards. Coinbase further discloses that staking operations occur transparently onchain through audited smart contracts.
 
Coinbase posits that by removing staking minimums, more individual users can participate in securing the Ethereum network while earning rewards. The move comes as staked ETH ratios continue rising after Ethereum’s recent upgrade. Coinbase Cloud is currently offering this new open staking access starting with integration in Coinbase Wallet.

To address these concerns, Emmer plans to sponsor an appropriations amendment aimed at restricting the SEC’s use of funds for crypto enforcement until clear rules and regulations are established.

According to insights from Ryan Selkis, the founder and CEO of Messari, the average fee for transferring ETH stands at $1.83, while the cost of token purchases via Uniswap is approximately $4.17. 
 
This decline in gas fees can be attributed to reduced on-chain activity related to Non-Fungible tokens (NFT) sales, meme coin trading, and Telegram bots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first week of September, an outflow of $59 million worth of digital assets managed by Digital Asset Funds was recorded, the latest Coinshares data has shown. The latest outflow means the value of digital asset investment products under management has dropped by a total of $294 million or 0.9% in the past four weeks. The Coinshares data shows bitcoin (BTC) as the digital asset which had the highest net outflow ($69 million) in the first week of September.
 
Bitcoin Short Inflows the Largest Since March
 
During the first week of September, digital asset investment products saw a net outflow of $59 million in assets under management (AUM), the latest data from the alternative asset manager Coinshare analysis has shown. According to the asset manager’s blog, the latest net outflow figure brings the value of total outflows in the past four weeks to $294 million, or 0.9% of total AUM.
 

 
As explained in the blog, inflows were also seen in short investment products and this may be an indication that the sentiment for digital assets remains poor. Concerns over the regulation of this asset class and the strengthening dollar are cited as some of the reasons why investors are less keen on investing in digital assets.
 
 
In terms of flows by asset, the Coinshares data shows bitcoin (BTC) as the digital asset that had the highest net outflow ($69 million) in the first week of September. On the other hand, short bitcoin net inflows during the same period topped $15 million, the largest since March 2023.
 
Meanwhile, Ethereum’s net outflow of $4.8 million during the same period saw its year-to-date outflows rise to US$108m representing 1.6% of the total AUM of $6.9 billion. Out of all the digital assets tracked by Coinshares, only XRP and other unidentified digital assets are shown to have recorded positive inflows of $0.7 million and $0.4 million respectively.
