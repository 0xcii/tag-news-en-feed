        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a study released by CoinWire, the global cryptocurrency trading volume will see a notable increase, boosting it to over $108 trillion before the end of 2024.
 
This figure is almost 90% higher than the trading volumes seen in 2022, signaling that a major potential increase in crypto transactions worldwide is on the horizon.
 
According to CoinWire, the study was compiled by gathering a list of centralized exchanges (CEX) on Coingecko with trust scores greater than 6.
 
CoinWire also disclosed that it collected other data such as “web traffic by country of every CEX, peak trading timezone of every country, supported languages of every CEX, and headquarters of every CEX.”

Runes Taking Over Bitcoin
 
However, as the crypto market recovers from the sting of last week, it is emerging that the Runes Protocol is taking over the Bitcoin network.

This means that only about 40% of all other transactions were from users keen on moving capital from one address to another. Bitcoin is designed to enable the borderless transfer of funds cheaply and efficiently.
