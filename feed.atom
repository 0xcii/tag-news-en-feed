After a brief spike in volume in Nov. 2022, dex trade volumes have been lackluster for the past 44 days. As of Jan. 14, 2023, Uniswap version three (V3) has the highest trade volume during the past 24 hours at $1.9 billion and the second-highest total value locked (TVL) at $3.57 billion. Metrics show that Curve holds the second-largest trade volume on Saturday with $399 million in 24 hours and the highest TVL in terms of assets locked in dex platforms, with $4.19 billion locked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana surged by as much as 30% on Saturday, setting a fresh multi-month high in the process. The move comes as cryptocurrency markets were significantly bullish to start the weekend, with the global market cap 8.28% higher as of writing. Shiba inu was trading at its strongest point since November.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was easily one of the biggest movers to start the weekend, with prices skyrocketing by as much as 30%.
 
Following a low of $16.52 yesterday, SOL/USD surged to an intraday high of $22.37 earlier today.
 
As a result of today’s rally the token hit its strongest point since November 9, when price was at a top of $24.60.
 
 
From the chart, the move commenced after yet another burst beyond a resistance point on the 14-day relative strength (RSI).
 
On this occasion, the index moved above a ceiling at the 80.00 level, and is now tracking at 85.44.
 
Although solana bulls will have their eyes set on $25.00, there could be a cooling off of the earlier rally as the day matures.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was once again a notable gainer in crypto markets, as the meme coin rose by over 10% today.
 
SHIB/USD hit a peak of $0.00001081 to start the weekend, after ending the working week at a low of $0.000009462.
 
Like with solana above, this resulted in prices climbing to their highest level since early November.
 
 
Overall, shiba inu has now risen for a third consecutive session, and is up 24% in the last seven days.
 
Earlier gains have already begun to show signs of easing, with price now trading at $0.00001039.
 
This comes after the RSI failed to break out of its long-term resistance point at the 80.00 mark.

In a recent interview with Reuters, Sun – the founder of Tron – said, “Depending on DCG’s assessment of the situation,” he would be willing to spend up to $1 billion on the Digital Currency Group’s holdings.
 
 
Suspension Of Withdrawals
 
Genesis is a part of DCG, and its clients are owed about $3 billion. The company’s lending arm stopped withdrawals on November 16, citing “extreme market dislocation.” This happened after the cryptocurrency exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin surged to a fresh two-month high on Jan. 14, as crypto markets were significantly higher on Saturday. The world’s largest cryptocurrency jumped above $21,000, as prices rallied for a sixth straight day. Ethereum traded above $1,500 to start the weekend, also hitting its strongest point since November.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rose for a sixth straight session to start the weekend, as prices moved above the $21,000 level.
 
BTC/USD climbed to a peak of $21,054.38 earlier in today’s session, which comes after prices were at a bottom of $18,793.66 on Friday.
 
This spike in price saw bitcoin add as much as 10% to its value in the last 24 hours, hitting its strongest point since November 5 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to surge. It is now tracking at 89.22.
 
Typically, a reading of 70.00 is seen as overbought, and with this print, which is its highest point in two years, we are deep in bear territory.
 
When price becomes overbought, many expect bearish sentiment to grow, as traders begin to short the market.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also hit a two-month high in today’s session, with price staying in the green for a seventh consecutive day.
 
Following a low of $1,404.82 on Friday, ETH/USD moved to an intraday high of $1,558.25 on Saturday.
 
As with bitcoin, this rally sent the world’s second largest cryptocurrency to its highest point since November 5.
 
 
Overall, ethereum is now trading over 23% higher in the last seven days.
 
The move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average extended a crossover of its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Despite this bullish momentum to start the weekend, many still expect some reversals over the next few days.

This may seem as a surprise, but with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showing an improving economic trend, a further upwards break is possible for BTC. 
 
Analysts say that if BTC breaks through this crucial resistance, the start of the bull market is at hand. However, rejection from this resistance is imminent at time of writing. Can Bitcoin overcome this in the next few days?
