His net worth has increased dramatically to $201 billion in less than two years, nearly sixfold. The skyrocketing stock price of Meta Platforms Inc., which has increased by about 60% just this year, is mostly the impetus for this surge.
 
Consequently, Zuckerberg is once again the fourth richest person in the world, behind only Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault, and Elon Musk.
 
 
The Metaverse: A Mixed Bag
 
Despite these amazing numbers, the metaverse remains controversy-ridden. While Zuckerberg maintains that it is the future of social interaction, many remain skeptical about it.

The meme coin’s rally was underscored when it recently surged past the $0.12 mark, confirming a bull breakout from a multi-month downtrend. Notably, a Dogecoin analysis reported earlier by Bitcoinist revealed significant price-defining levels for the meme coin, with $0.12 being a major one.
 
 
This notable increase might just be the beginning of Dogecoin’s rally. Interestingly, this outlook is echoed by a host of crypto analysts and meme coin investors.
