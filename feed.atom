        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between 2019 and 2022, the value of foreign capital that flowed into Nigeria dropped from $23.9 billion to $5.32 billion.

According to the SEC’s press release, the regulatory body charged Justin Sun and his three wholly-owned companies – namely Tron Foundation Limited, BitTorrent Foundation Ltd, and Rainberry Inc – of fraud for the unregistered sale of alleged securities to investors.
 
The regulatory body accuses Sun of “extensive wash trading which involves the simultaneous or near-simultaneous purchase and sale of a security to make it appear actively traded without an actual change in beneficial ownership, and for orchestrating a scheme to pay celebrities to tout TRX and BTT without disclosing their compensation.”
