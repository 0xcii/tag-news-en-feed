Gilbert Armenta, who held several important posts in the OneCoin venture, was convicted of actively engaging in a scheme that embezzled investors out of millions of dollars.
 
He pled guilty in 2018 to conspiring to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and extortion in relation to the OneCoin project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The largest marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Opensea, has announced major changes to its fee structure and policies in response to a shift in the NFT ecosystem. The company detailed that it will drop fees to zero for a limited time and offer an optional creator earnings model with a minimum of 0.5% for all collections that do not use onchain enforcement.
 
Opensea Drops Fees While Facing Tough Competition from Rivals Like Blur, Looksrare, and X2Y2
 
Opensea, the NFT marketplace, announced on Friday that it is dropping fees in response to a major change that started in October 2022. “We began to see significant volume and users migrate to NFT marketplaces that do not fully enforce creator earnings,” Opensea said. “Today, that shift has accelerated dramatically despite our best efforts.”
 
Opensea pointed out that roughly 80% of the total ecosystem volume is not paying full creator earnings, and most of the sales volume has moved to a no-fee environment. The NFT market has faced competition recently from the new market Blur, which has captured $1.4 billion in all-time sales volume in a short period. However, Blur’s all-time sales are small in comparison to Opensea’s $34.53 billion in all-time sales.
 
 
The NFT marketplace also faces competition from digital collectible markets Looksrare and X2Y2. Opensea hopes the new changes will strike the right balance of incentives and motivations for all ecosystem participants, including creators, collectors, and power buyers and sellers. Additionally, the company announced it is updating its operator filter to allow sales using NFT marketplaces with the same policies, including Blur. “This is the start of a new era for Opensea. We’re excited to test this model,” the company said.

Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) also moved higher to start the weekend, with prices climbing to a nine-day high.
 
Following a low of $7.26 on Friday, LINK/USD raced to a peak of $7.71 earlier in today’s session.

Scaling Blockfinex’s Crypto Payment Processing Business
 
The Nigerian crypto payment gateway, Fluidcoins, was recently acquired for an undisclosed sum by the Seychelles-registered crypto exchange company Blockfinex. According to a Techcabal report, Blockfinex’s acquisition of a 100% stake in the Nigerian firm came some 18 months after Fluidcoins’ last capital raise of $150,000.
 
Commenting on the acquisition that was facilitated by Dan Holdings Limited, Blockfinex founder and CEO Danny Oyekan reportedly said:
 

This acquisition was driven by a decision to venture into wallet as a service business and crypto payment processing and scale it across the world.
 
Blockfinex reportedly said it will leverage the acquisition to launch its own platform known as Blockpay. Besides being a payment processor and application programming interface (API) wallet-as-a-service provider, Blockpay will facilitate payments for Fluidcoins’ existing clients such as Accrue, The Peer, and Getequity, the report added.
 

 
Meanwhile, Fluidcoins CEO Lanre Adenowo is quoted describing his firm’s reported acquisition by Blockfinex as an “acquihire deal” that will not result in management or staff changes. The deal nonetheless allows Fluidcoins to keep operating.
 
According to the report, the acquisition deal includes all of the Nigerian crypto payment gateway’s entities including Flip and Fluidshops.
