        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two FTX's former executives who testified against the  
exchange's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, have been scheduled for sentencing,  
Reuters reported. Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, once high-ranking figures within  
the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, will soon learn their fates. 
FTX Executives Await Sentencing
Nishad Singh, scheduled for sentencing on October 30,  
and Gary Wang, on November 20, both pleaded guilty to fraud charges in  
Manhattan federal court. Their testimonies were important in the case against  
Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison last March for  
orchestrating an $8 billion fraud scheme. 
Prosecutors labeled it one of the largest financial  
frauds in US history. The sentences for Singh and Wang could be influenced by  
their cooperation with the authorities. US District Judge Lewis Kaplan will  
consider their assistance during the proceedings. This could reportedly result  
in more lenient punishments, acknowledging their roles in unveiling the massive  
fraud that brought FTX down.
Bankman-Fried's conviction last year sent shockwaves  
through the cryptocurrency world. His actions not only led to the collapse of  
FTX but also shook investor confidence in the broader crypto market. 
The testimonies of Singh and Wang were crucial in  
securing the conviction, highlighting the inner workings and deceptive  
practices within the crypto exchange. The outcomes will not only impact the  
lives of Singh and Wang but also set a precedent for how cooperation in such  
high-profile cases might be rewarded or penalized.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.
