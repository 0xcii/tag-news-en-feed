Shiba Inu Investor Makes Bank
 
On-chain analytics platform Spot On Chain revealed that a particular trader had been making massive moves in the market over the last few months. The trader had begun buying large chunks of SHIB tokens back in January when the price was still trending below $0.00001. In total, the whale trader was able to accumulate around 1.24 trillion SHIB for $11.66 million at the time.

This latest release is now available for immediate testing and seamless integration.
Some key highlights of SRI 1.0.0 include:

Miners can connect to SV2 pools without upgrading existing SV1 firmware through Translation Proxy or directly using an SV2 firmware device like BraiinsOS.
Miners have the flexibility to run their bitcoin nodes, construct templates, and declare them to the SV2 Pool.
The implementation of pool fallback functionality ensures continuity in mining activities even if a pool decides to censor transactions, thereby incentivizing pools to prioritize miners' interests.

When Bitcoin was declining, the cryptocurrency had dropped to a low of $60,600, which appears to have been the bottom, at least so far, given that the coin has rebounded sharply since hitting the mark.
 
Around the time of BTC’s recent low prices, an analyst had pointed out in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post that the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) had plunged to a value of 1 alongside the asset’s drop.
