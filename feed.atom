        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price difficulties earlier this week appear to have been largely driven by a significant selloff by miners, commonly referred to as miner capitulation. On-chain data shows that the total amount of BTC held by miners has crashed massively in the last three days. In particular, these miners recently sold $1.71 billion worth of BTC in a short period of time. As you might imagine, this trend is concerning for Bitcoin, especially as the cryptocurrency is currently struggling to regain momentum and climb back above the critical $60,000 price level.
