News of Lummis’s participation in The Bitcoin Policy Summit by The Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) comes after comments made by the Senator in support of bitcoin mining earlier this year: "Bitcoin mining is good for America’s energy grids and the development of new/stranded energy resources… Bitcoin miners, we’d love to have you in Wyoming.”

Bitcoin Whales Have Scooped Up More Than 100,000 BTC Recently
 
As pointed out by analyst Ali in a post on X, the BTC whales have purchased more than 100,000 BTC over the last week. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” metric from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment.
 
This indicator tells us about the total amount of Bitcoin that the different wallet groups in the market are holding right now. The addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the total number of coins that they are carrying in their balance.
 
 
The 1-10 coins group, for instance, includes all wallets holding at least 1 and at most 10 BTC. In the conte…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin U.S. spot ETFs saw a remarkable reversal this week, with a massive $418 million net inflow on Tuesday. This comes after the ETFs experienced 5 straight days of net outflows last week during Bitcoin's dip below $60,000.

NEW: #Bitcoin ETFs saw a $418 million net inflow yesterday following five consecutive days of outflows last week.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 27, 2024
  
  
  
The turnaround signals renewed confidence among institutional investors, who have eagerly piled into Bitcoin ETFs since the first US ETF approval earlier this year. The SEC has now approved eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs after years of rejecting applications.
Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust ETF (FBTC) led Tuesday's surge. It saw a staggering $279 million in inflows, the largest single-day gain since its launch. 
The influx starkly contrasts last week's bearish sentiment, when over $200 million flowed out of Bitcoin ETFs as prices fluctuated amid a broader Bitcoin price dip.
Now, with Bitcoin stabilizing around $70,000, institutional interest is returning. While Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) continued bleeding assets, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw $162 million added on Tuesday. The total assets under management across Bitcoin ETFs are nearly $59 billion. 
The sharp inflow reversal underscores Wall Street's growing appetite for Bitcoin exposure via regulated investment vehicles. Bitcoin ETFs are passing their first real test in a volatile market environment.
If the adoption trend persists despite market swings, Bitcoin ETFs could cement their status as the preferred Bitcoin on-ramps for institutional dollars. Their growth and resilience reflect Bitcoin's broadening mainstream acceptance.]]></summary>
