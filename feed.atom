After a plane, a ferry, and a train had brought me to Manhattan, NY, we found ourselves with thirty-something minutes to set up for a sit-down interview with presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., thirty-something floors high in a Hudson Yards’ hotel. Captured by filmmaker Jeremy Poley, RFK answered our questions for about forty minutes. His responses were sharp and well articulated with an encyclopedic recall ability. He answered every single question I had prepared. Perhaps lost in the mainstream noise attempting to diminish his inarguable counterculture resonance is his general likability.

Why Grayscale’s Meeting With SEC Is Significant
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart made this development known and specifically stated that the meeting was with the SEC’s division of trading and markets, which took place on November 20. This development is significant as this division of the SEC is in charge of approving or denying proposed rule changes (in this case, as it relates to Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust).

However, until this point, people interested in bitcoin will be differentiated from those who are yet to begin their journey down the bitcoin rabbit hole. The question is then raised, how does a bitcoiner describe themselves to others, that may help bridge the chasm between their own understanding and those still plugged into The Matrix?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent legal move, Digital Currency Group’s (DCG) subsidiary Genesis Global Capital LLC has filed a complaint against the crypto exchange platform and custodian Gemini. Genesis hopes to claw back $689 million from the centralized crypto trading platform founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in 2014. 
 
Genesis Targets Gemini in $689M Legal Battle Over Alleged Preferential Crypto Withdrawals
 
The court filing, filed on November 21, 2023, accuses Gemini of withdrawing over $689 million in the months leading to Genesis’ Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. This action, according to Genesis, unfairly benefited Gemini at the expense of other creditors.
 
The complaint, filed in the wake of significant crypto market instability that began in 2022, targets transactions occurring in the 90 days preceding Genesis’ bankruptcy declaration. According to the document, Gemini’s withdrawals totaled approximately $689.30 million, a move Genesis describes as preferential and detrimental to the broader creditor base.
 
This situation arose during a period marked by notable fluctuations and uncertainty within the cryptocurrency sector, further complicating the financial dynamics at play. Genesis’ legal strategy aims to invoke the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code to rectify what it perceives as an inequitable situation.
 
 
By doing so, they intend to recover the withdrawn funds in a clawback, thereby restoring a level playing field among all of Genesis’ creditors. The lawyers insist the focus is not just on the monetary aspect but also on the principles of fairness and equitable treatment in bankruptcy proceedings.
 
The complaint details the significant withdrawals by Gemini, characterizing them as preferential transfers. These actions, as per the filing, allowed Gemini to allegedly gain an advantage over other creditors, an advantage that Genesis seeks to nullify.
