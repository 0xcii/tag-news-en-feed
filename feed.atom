The XRP US Dollar Futures contracts, or XUS, were scheduled to start trading yesterday, on August 13, 2024. However, the official website didn’t show any XRP Futures at press time.

The XUS contract will be a physically settled futures contract, involving 100,000 units of XRP.

Bitcoin Difficulty Regression Model Puts Mining Cost At $57,200
 
In a new post on X, analyst Checkmate talked about the current situation of Bitcoin miners. The analyst referred to the Difficulty Regression Model, which estimates the average production cost of these chain validators for mining one asset token.
 
This model bases itself on the network’s Difficulty, which measures how hard the miners would find it to find new blocks. The BTC blockchain automatically adjusts the Difficulty every two weeks based on the speed at which miners have performed their tasks since the last adjustment.
