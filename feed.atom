        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent survey by Germany’s central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, reveals a surprising openness among Germans towards the digital euro, the European Central Bank’s (ECB) proposed digital currency. However, the survey also exposes a significant knowledge gap that needs to be addressed before the system’s potential can be fully realized.
 
 
While a staggering three-fifths (60%) of Germans surveyed admitted to having never encountered information about the digital euro, half (50%) expressed a willingness to potentially use it if offered as an additional payment option. This openness, despite a lack of familiarity, suggests a public appetite for innovation in the payments landscape.

a large portion of a London lawsuit, valued at up to 10 billion pounds ($12.8

London Lawsuit Targets Binance and Kraken
The lawsuit, brought to London's Competition Appeal Tribunal  
(CAT) on behalf of over 200,000 BSV owners, targets Binance and other exchanges  
including Kraken. The suit, filed by BSV Claims, accuses the exchanges of  
anti-competitive behaviour in delisting BSV in 2019. 
The plaintiffs argue that  
this action caused the value of BSV to drop significantly and hindered its  
potential to become a leading cryptocurrency, estimating this aspect of the  
claim at up to 9 billion pounds.

Delving into the significance of this development, cryptocurrency analyst and trader YG Crypto has emphasized that Bitcoin must break above the level and maintain that break in order for the digital asset to regain its bullish momentum.
 
The $70,000 Price Mark Is Crucial For Bitcoin
 
The analyst’s findings underscore the possibility of large price swings if this barrier is overcome and sustained, which coincides with the resurgence of interest in BTC among institutional and individual investors. This resistance level is believed to be crucial for sustaining market optimism and propelling Bitcoin’s upward trend toward new all-time heights.
