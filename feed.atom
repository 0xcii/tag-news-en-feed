        <updated>2023-07-05T13:04:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Denmark’s  
financial markets supervisor has demanded that Saxo Bank dump its  
cryptocurrency holdings. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA)  
stated this in a statement released today (Wednesday), noting that the  
multi-asset broker’s trading in digital assets for its own accounts falls  
outside the investment bank’s “lawful area of activity.”
Danish  
Watchdog Frowns at Saxo Bank
As a bank that specializes in online trading and investment, Saxo Bank offers  
a wide range of financial products and services, including online trading in  
stocks, bonds, commodities, forex, contracts for difference, fiat currencies and  
cryptocurrencies.
According  
to the FSA, the Copenhagen-based investment bank hedges its crypto assets to  
match the market risk associated with its digital asset products. However, the  
regulator noted that trading in crypto is not part of the supported  
activities listed in Appendix 1 of the Danish Financial Business Act. 
“Unregulated  
trading of crypto assets can create distrust in the financial system, and the  
Danish FSA finds that legitimising trading in crypto-assets would be  
unjustified,” the financial watchdog explained. “Thus, the activity cannot be  
accepted as an ancillary banking activity for reasons of financial stability,  
cf. section 24 of the Danish Financial Business Act.”
Furthermore,  
the regulator pointed  
out that because the European Union’s recently  
passed crypto  
regulation, Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), will only come into enforcement in  
its entirety on December  
30, 2024, crypto trading among financial institutions “remains unregulated for  
the time being.”
Saxo Bank  
did not immediately respond to Finance Magnates’request for comment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin dropped below $31,000 on Wednesday, as markets consolidated ahead of the upcoming U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. The minutes of last month’s meeting are expected to show the Fed’s potential path to further hikes this year. Ethereum fell for a second straight session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated on Wednesday, as markets prepared for the release of last month’s FOMC minutes.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $30,656.03 earlier in the session, following a peak at $31,106.00 the day prior.
 
The decline resulted in bitcoin retreating further away from last Friday’s one-year high, which was at $31,443.

Overall, sentiment appears to have shifted bearish, and this comes after the relative strength index (RSI) failed to break out of a ceiling at 70.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 63.76, which is marginally below a support point at 63.99.
 
The next visible floor appears to be at 59.00, and should momentum continue in this current direction, a collision could take place in the coming days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) was in the red for a second consecutive session, after failing to sustain a breakout of a key price ceiling.
 
Following a high at $1,964.89 on July 4, ETH/USD moved to a low at $1,920.79 earlier in the day.
 
Ethereum’s current downturn comes after it was unable to maintain Monday’s breakout of the $1,970 resistance level.

In addition to this, the RSI also fell below a ceiling of its own at 61.00, and is now at a reading of 57.54.
 
Bears had expected a shift in momentum after price strength rose deep into overbought territory in the past two weeks.
 
Despite this, bullish sentiment could potentially return following this afternoon’s report.

According to Bitcoin maximalist and former CTO of Coinbase, Balaji Srinivasan, there’s a surprising revelation: Elon Musk can run for President of the United States, despite facing some expected roadblocks.
 
Balaji’s assertion is not based on mere speculation; it draws from a groundbreaking poll conducted by Harvard University’s Center for American Political Studies.
