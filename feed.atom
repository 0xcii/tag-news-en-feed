        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese regulators have started to review and ease crypto regulations in the country. The cryptocurrency industry has been grappling in recent times and is trying to recover from FTX’s collapse, which has shaken the broader market severely.
 
Despite such tumultuous times, Japan has remained optimistic about crypto and has been easing the tough regulations. Japan has planned to make it easier for exchanges to list tokens in order to encourage further liberalization of the industry.
 
Additionally, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), which is the integrated financial regulator of Japan, has decided to put an end to the ban on the domestic distribution of foreign-issued stablecoins in the upcoming year.
 
This new stablecoin regulation in Japan will allow local exchanges to permit stableco…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The tech company led by Michael Saylor has increased its bitcoin holdings by 2,500 BTC despite selling bitcoin for the first time to generate a tax benefit.

Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy bought 2,395 BTC for $42.8 million in cash between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21, 2022.
It then sold 704 BTC at a loss on Dec. 22 to offset previous capital gains. 
MicroStrategy then bought 810 BTC on Dec. 24.

Software analytics company MicroStrategy has sold bitcoin for the first time since it first began adding the digital currency to its treasury in 2020.
The sale took place on December 22, 2022, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The move was carried out in order to generate a net tax benefit, as the losses involved in the sale are able to offset previous capital gains, per the filing. Two days later, MicroStrategy bought back more bitcoin than it sold, however at a higher price –– $16,845 per BTC on the 810 bitcoin purchase vs. $16,776 on the 704 bitcoin sale.
A larger purchase preceded the sale. MicroStrategy bought 2,395 bitcoin between November 1 and December 21, 2022, before embarking on the tax-loss harvesting strategy. The purchase cost about $42.8 million, translating to an average price of $17,871 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.
Ultimately, the transactions resulted in an increase of MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings by 2,500 BTC. The company led by Michael Saylor now holds 132,500 BTC, acquired for about $4.03 billion at an average price of $30,397 per bitcoin. As a result, the Virginia-based firm currently faces an unrealized loss of over $1.8 billion.]]></summary>

​​This is an opinion editorial by Anita Posch, the founder of Bitcoin For Fairness who has traveled around the world to learn how the globally unbanked can benefit from sovereign money.
In early 2020, during my first visit in Zimbabwe, my assumption that Bitcoin is needed the most in the Global South was confirmed. I found a nation in distress about money, because of a kleptocratic ruling elite that had been defrauding and stealing from their people by inflating the national currency for decades. Despite this, corruption and military support allowed these leaders to stay at the top for over 40 years.
The need was there, but what about understanding of Bitcoin? …]]></summary>
