Crypto Mogul Do Kwon Faces Jail Time 
 
Earlier this month, the Basic Court in Podgorica had approved Kwon and Chong-joon’s release on bail to the tune of €400,000 ($430,500). However, the prosecution promptly appealed the ruling, which led to the case being sent to the higher judge for a final decision.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ltc-falls-6-doge-moves-to-2-week-low/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-24T15:56:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin was a notable mover on Wednesday, as the token dropped by as much as 6% in today’s session. The decline came as a red wave swept through the crypto market, leading to the global cap falling by 2% at the time of writing. Dogecoin also dropped, hitting a two-week low.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was one of Wednesday’s biggest movers, as the token fell by as much as 6% in today’s session.
 
LTC/USD dropped to a bottom of $85.87 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $91.79.
 
The decline in price pushed litecoin to its weakest point since May 15, when it last broke out of a floor at $85.00.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that today’s move transpired as the relative strength index (RSI) fell below a support level of 50.00.
 
Currently, price strength is now tracking at 46.95, with the next visible floor at the 39.00 mark.
 
Although LTC has rebounded from an earlier low, and is now trading at $86.61, a breakout below $85.00 remains possible.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was also in the red on Wednesday, as it fell to a multi-week low of its own.
 
Following a high of $0.07305 on Tuesday, DOGE/USD slipped to a low of $0.07103 in today’s session.
 
This drop in price pushed the meme coin to its lowest point since May 12, which is the last time it traded under $0.07000.
 
 
Overall, dogecoin has mostly consolidated between the aforementioned low, and a resistance level at $0.0750 for the past few weeks.
 
In order to move away from this current threshold, a ceiling of 43.00, or floor at 36.00 will need to be broken.
 
At the time of writing, the index is at a reading of 37.42.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the crypto space awaits the summary judgment on the case between the US SEC and Ripple Labs, controversies keep rising due to diverse user opinions and perspectives.
 
In a recent development on May 23,  a prominent Bitcoin proponent Max Keiser took to Twitter to criticize XRP and the XRP community. Keiser stated that XRP is a shitcoin according to the legal position of El-Salvador on the crypto asset definition. 
 
Ripple CTO Reacts To SEC Actions Attracting Max Keiser’s Criticisms
 
Keiser’s criticism of XRP came as a response to the tweet Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz posted. Schwartz who was reacting to the SEC’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies, had noted that the resolution of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit might impact the US crypto industry.
