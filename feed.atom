Bitcoin Prices Falling
 
BTC is trading at around $28,100, down roughly 7% from April peaks. Moreover, looking at the performance in the daily chart, it looks like bears are pressing on, anchoring on the April 19 bear candle.
 
Losses on April 19 were deep and reversed refreshing gains of early this week. The resulting bar also had decent trading volumes, suggesting traders were eager to sell.
 
Presently, BTC is trading below key resistance levels established in April. Currently, $31,000, marking April 2023 and H1 2023 high, remains a crucial reaction point that chartists are closely watching.

Bitcoin Racing Team has entered Netflix star driver Sebastian Melrose in the Porsche Carrera Cup with the Richardson Racing Team, winner of last year’s event. The championship takes place over eight weekends across the UK and is broadcasted live on ITV. Melrose has previously achieved success in the Formula Ford 1600 and 2019 GT racing series, and was runner-up in the Netflix TV series “Too Hot to Handle.” 
 
         
         
         
         
    
He expressed his excitement to be entering the Porsche Carrera Cup GB this season with Bitcoin Racing, and the team is looking forward to introducing Bitcoin to a new audience over the 2023 season. The Bitcoin Racing Team aims to bring Bitcoin to a wider audience and is actively looking for additional Bitcoin-related sponsors.
Charles Mackenzie, the team's Deputy Principal, expressed confidence that with Melrose's skills and the professionalism of the Richardson Racing Team, they could see a podium or two before the end of the season. Mackenzie's father, Andrew Mackenzie, is the team's principal and an accomplished racing driver. He and his son are avid Bitcoiners and sought to bring Bitcoin to a wider audience through racing.
Jason Deane, a Bitcoin consultant who joined forces with the Bitcoin Racing Team last year, expressed his excitement to be part of the team's mission to introduce Bitcoin to a whole new audience over the 2023 season. "There has simply never been exposure of the Bitcoin logo on this scale via mainstream channels before, and we look forward to expanding on the conversations it will inevitably start!" Deane said.
The Bitcoin Racing Team has seven cars over three championships with six drivers and is officially endorsed by El Salvador. The team flies the flag of El Salvador on the roof of its cars in all championships.]]></summary>

MyEListing, a commercial real estate marketplace, is set to launch the world's first bitcoin-enabled real estate marketplace through a Coinbase integration. This new platform allows buyers to purchase U.S. real estate properties with bitcoin or cash. MyEListing's CEO, Caleb Richter, stated that the program will "drive innovation in the crypto and real estate industries."
The press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine claims the program aims to bring new convenience, accessibility and greater profitability to the market. Agents can now list U.S. commercial and residential properties to be sold for cryptocurrency or cash on the platform, and anyone worldwide can purchase them within one business day through the ASAP program. The transaction times are also expected to be nearly 50 times faster than current averages, according to the press release.
The platform is initially launching for Texas-only properties on April 20, 2023, with plans to expand to other select states in June 2023. The list of available properties to purchase with bitcoin is available on the MyEListing website. The ASAP program's explainer video provides a step-by-step guide on how the process works.
The integration of Coinase by MyEListing is expected to change the way people invest in real estate by providing a secure and efficient way to buy and sell properties, the press release states. As Richter explained, "with the ASAP program, anyone, regardless of the language they speak or where they are in the world, can purchase residential and commercial real estate with crypto in as little as one business day."
The program's success will be determined in the coming months as it expands to other states and attracts more buyers and sellers.]]></summary>

The network’s difficulty now stands at 48.71 trillion, marking a 22.62% increase over the last 55 days since block height 778,176.
 
Bitcoin’s Difficulty Has Risen More Than 22% Since Block Height 778,176
 

 
In less than two months, Bitcoin’s difficulty surged by over 22% and reached an all-time high on Thursday, April 20. The current difficulty of 48.71 trillion implies an exceptionally high average hash rate necessary for mining a new block. Specifically, a miner would need an average hashrate of 48.71 trillion hashes per second to stand a chance of mining a BTC block and earning the associated rewards and transaction fees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
