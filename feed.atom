In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Deaton criticized Gensler’s supposed disregard for the court, including the Supreme Court. He says people like Gensler “are inherently arrogant” and think “they are above the law.” He further labeled the SEC Chair a “real life example of a megalomaniac.”

The FCA’s four-page letter outlines its diligent efforts to establish a collaborative dialogue with digital currency firms, aiding them in navigating the new set of rules unveiled earlier this year.
