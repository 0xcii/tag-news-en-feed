        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e746ac9adca</id>
        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/binance-recovers-73-million-in-stolen-cryptocurrency-up-33/"/>
        <updated>2024-08-08T14:06:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of July 31 this year, Binance had recovered $73 million in stolen cryptocurrencies. This represents a notable 33%  
increase from the approximately $55 million secured in 2023.
Recovering and Freezing Illegal Crypto Assets 
According to the crypto exchange giant, the platform's  
security team has been at the forefront of recovering misplaced and lost funds  
and freezing ill-gotten gains that find their way onto the exchange. Binance  
has also reportedly collaborated with both industry peers and the public sector  
to ensure that affected users receive the necessary support.
The majority of the recovered and frozen funds  
approximately 80%—are tied to hacks, exploits, and thefts that occur outside  
the Binance platform. The remaining 20% involves scams that also originate  
externally. 
Binance's stance has been instrumental in these  
recoveries, with Chief Security Officer Jimmy Su emphasizing the company's  
user-centric culture as a driving force behind these achievements.
Contrary to what might be expected, the increase in  
recovered and frozen funds does not indicate a rise in criminal activity within  
the cryptocurrency space. With all transactions publicly recorded, it has  
reportedly become easier to trace and recover stolen funds.
Crypto Crime Report
According to Chainalysis' 2024 Crypto Crime Report,  
the total value received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses dropped  
significantly in 2023. The report noted a decline in the share of all crypto  
transaction volume associated with illicit activity, from 0.42% in 2022 to  
0.34% in 2023.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Metaplanet, a publicly listed Japanese investment firm, has secured a ¥1 billion ($6.8 million) loan to purchase additional Bitcoin. This comes just days after announcing plans to raise ¥10.08 billion through a stock rights offering, mostly for Bitcoin buys.

JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japanese public company Metaplanet secures ¥1 billion loan to buy more #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/VNVemLD9cy
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 8, 2024
  
  
  
Metaplanet first revealed its Bitcoin treasury strategy in May, aiming to hedge against yen depreciation. The firm currently holds around 246 Bitcoins worth $14 million acquired over many buys.
The 0.1% APR loan from shareholder MMXX Ventures has a 6-month term. Metaplanet plans to allocate the entire ¥1 billion to expand its Bitcoin reserves.
At current prices, ¥1 billion could purchase around 118 additional bitcoins. This mimics MicroStrategy's playbook of raising debt to fund Bitcoin purchases since 2020. MicroStrategy's bitcoin bet has increased its share price dramatically.
CEO Simon Gerovich stated that the firm believes Bitcoin offers twin benefits as an asset that can appreciate and hedge against a weakening yen.
By securing loans and issuing stock to accumulate bitcoin, Metaplanet is essentially borrowing yen to stack sats. The company can pay back loans using future Bitcoin appreciation.
The loan and planned stock offering highlight Metaplanet's commitment to aggressively growing its Bitcoin war chest. As a public company, this strategy indirectly exposes Japanese investors to Bitcoin.
