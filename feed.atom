        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin saw a five-day winning streak snapped on Wednesday, with today’s drop engulfing recent gains. The meme coin fell by as much as 6% in today’s session, as sentiment in the crypto market shifted. Solana was also lower, plunging by 9%.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) plunged on Wednesday, as bears entered the market, snapping a five-day win streak in the process.
 
Following a low of $0.0853 last Friday, DOGE/USD surged to a peak of $0.0950 during yesterday’s session.
 
These gains were wiped today, as the meme coin fell to a low of $0.0851 earlier in the day.
 
 
One of the main catalysts for the drop seems to be a breakout on the relative strength index (RSI), which fell below a floor at 60.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 54.98, which is marginally higher than a floor at 53.00.
 
DOGE has since rebounded, and is currently at $0.08815, however should the RSI continue to fall, the coin could move below $0.0850.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Another notable mover on Wednesday was solana (SOL), which fell by as much as 9% today.
 
SOL/USD dropped to a bottom at $22.27 earlier in the day, which comes following Tuesday’s peak at $25.22.
 
As a result of the decline, solana fell to its weakest point since last Tuesday, when the token traded at a low of $20.83.
 
 
Like with dogecoin, today’s drop seems to have coincided with a breakout on the RSI indicator, which moved below 57.00.
 
Price strength is currently at a reading of 53.36, and is fast approaching a lower point of support at 51.00.
 
If this downturn continues for the remainder of the week, there is a strong possibility that SOL will move below $20.00.

Crypto Futures Market Has Seen Liquidations Of Around $236 Million In Last 24 Hours
 
A “liquidation” occurs when a futures contract holder’s bet fails and the price moves in the loss direction just enough that a certain percentage of the margin (the initial collateral) is drained, leading to the derivative exchange to forcibly close or “liquidate” the position.
 
One factor that can significantly increase the risk of a contract getting liquidated is the degree of leverage the investor has opted for. “Leverage” here refers to a loan amount that’s often many times the initial position itself.
 
While leverage means that any profits that the holder earns b…]]></summary>

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the whales’ month-long dump seems to be over. The relevant indicator here is the “BTC Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the amount and percentage of the total Bitcoin circulating supply that is currently being held by each wallet group in the sector.
 
Wallets are divided into these wallet groups based on the total number of coins that they are carrying in their balances right now. For example, the 1-10 coins cohort includes all addresses that are holding between 1 and 10 BTC.

The documents revealed that Twitter was already fully acquired by the Elon Musk owned X Corp. on April 4, which is part of the parent company called X Holdings Corp. Remarkably, Musk incorporated three holding companies called X Holdings I, II and III as early as April 2022 to prepare Twitter acquisition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell to a one-week low on Apr. 19, as markets moved into consolidation following a recent bull run. Following today’s red wave, prices neared a breakout below the $29,000 level earlier in the session. Ethereum also declined, falling below $2,000.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved lower on Wednesday, as markets began to consolidate following recent gains in price.
 
Following a high of $30,470.30 on Tuesday, BTC/USD dropped to a bottom at the $29,102.17 mark earlier in the day.
 
The low sent bitcoin to its lowest point since April 10, which is when price was last below $29,000.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, it appears that today’s sell-off took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell below a floor at 59.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 54.97, with the next visible point of support at the 55.00 mark.
 
Should this level be hit, there is a good chance that BTC will be trading around a floor at $28,600.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, Wednesday’s red wave also pushed ethereum (ETH) lower, with the price dropping below $2,000.
 
ETH/USD hit a low of $1,967.17 earlier today, which comes less than 24 hours after it traded at a peak of $2,121.53.
 
The move came as ethereum fell below its recent price floor at the $2,030 level, with some eyeing a lower floor at $1,830.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Ultimately, ETH was relatively overbought in recent days, with the RSI hitting a reading above 75.00 to start the week.
 
This led to bears reentering the market, which have now pushed price strength to a current reading at 55.00
 
A floor at 51.00 could be the target for sellers, which would almost certainly see ETH trading under $1,900.

The result of its rally has been multiple new coins coming out of the blockchain as they try to leverage this newfound liquidity. In this report, we take a look at some of the promising meme coins that have been making a splash.
 
PufDAO (PUF)
 
For PufDAO (PUF), this meme coin was launched two days ago and it seems to play into the 4/20 meme on Twitter. However, unlike other 4/20 meme coins that have arisen during this time, PUF has seen a reasonable level of success.
 
 
After launching at a price of $0.0000002101, the meme coin knocked off two zeroes by early Wednesday to reach an all-time high of $0.00002123, according to data from Dextools. This put its market cap at i…]]></summary>
