On-chain data shows that the crypto trader deposited 86 million DOGE into the crypto exchange Robinhood in an effort to profit from the meme coin’s recent price surge. The whale, however, looks to be bullish on the meme coin in the long term, as they have since repurchased a significant amount of DOGE and still hold a substantial amount of it. 
 
Meanwhile, due to the size of such a sale, the price of Dogecoin has since dipped and is currently on a downward trend. Before now, Dogecoin and other meme coins had led other altcoin…]]></summary>

According to Buckley, Vanguard has been receiving numerous inquiries on the potential of the company finally offering a spot Bitcoin ETF.

Individual bitcoin holders have numerous tools available that can help reduce the risk of loss or theft. In a previous article, we covered some of these tools, highlighting modifications commonly applied to singlesig wallets. However, we also explained why these approaches fall short of removing single points of failure entirely.
