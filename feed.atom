        <updated>2024-06-25T13:31:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The German government has transferred millions in seized Bitcoin to major Bitcoin and crypto exchanges Kraken and Coinbase, according to blockchain analysis firm Arkham.
The transfers originated from a wallet connected to the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). In 2013, the BKA seized almost 50,000 Bitcoin, from a film piracy website.
On Tuesday, the BKA wallet moved $24 million in Bitcoin across two transactions to Kraken and Coinbase. An additional $30 million in Bitcoin was sent to an unknown wallet not affiliated with an exchange.
Arkham data shows that these transfers follow previous movements of $195 million in Bitcoin to exchanges on June 19 and 20. Over $425 million has been shifted in the past week.
While the German government still holds the majority of the seized Bitcoin, the transfers to exchanges may signal an intent to liquidate some of the assets.
Selling government-held Bitcoin introduces potential downward price pressure. However, the amounts moved so far represent a relatively small portion of daily Bitcoin trading volume. 
Nonetheless, Bitcoin dipped below $60,000 on Tuesday amid this news. The German government's Bitcoin wallet still holds over 46,000 Bitcoin worth nearly $3 billion. 
For German police, the Bitcoin seized from illegal activities has dramatically increased in value. Selling even a fraction provides an unexpected windfall. However, concerns about potential impacts on the broader Bitcoin market remain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a chilling display of digital deception, a sophisticated deepfake scam featuring an uncanny likeness of Elon Musk recently duped thousands of cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Over the weekend, YouTube hosted a five-hour livestream where an AI-generated Musk announced a “revolutionary” Tesla event alongside a “generous cryptocurrency giveaway.”
 
 
The catch? Viewers had to send their Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Dogecoin to a specific address, with the promise of doubling their investment instantly. What seemed like a golden opportunity for quick financial gain turned out to be a well-crafted trap, exploiting the trust and excitement of Musk’s followers.

JUST IN: #Bitcoin lightning payments app Strike launches to millions across the UK 🇬🇧 pic.twitter.com/lIcW6xF7YG
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 25, 2024
  
  
  
Founded by Jack Mallers, Strike aims to make Bitcoin accessible through its mobile app, which leverages the Lightning Network. With the UK launch, Strike is now available in 100 countries worldwide. 
Jack Mallers said they are committed to growing Bitcoin adoption and providing its services globally despite regulatory complexities. "Our work is far from done," he added.
To use Strike in the UK, users must pass an "appropriateness assessment" quiz about Bitcoin, which is required under local regulations. The app also includes customary risk warnings.
Strike offers several features for UK customers, including buying Bitcoin with instant bank transfers, setting recurring purchases, and self-custody withdrawals.
The app also utilizes Lightning Network to enable instant, unlimited, and free payments globally between Strike users, providing a frictionless transnational transfer experience.
While Strike said some companies have exited the UK market, its expansion reflects a belief in Bitcoin's potential. The UK presents opportunities as the world's 6th largest economy.
Strike continues working to make Bitcoin accessible for regular users and businesses worldwide. While region-specific regulations create hurdles, the company aims to comply while delivering key functionality.]]></summary>
