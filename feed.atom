According to a Fortune report on the matter, the decision was communicated to Paxos by Jorge Tenreiro, acting chief of the SEC’s crypto assets unit, and comes more than a year after the regulator sent a Wells notice to the New York-based institution, indicating a possible enforcement action over the Binance USD, or commonly known as BUSD, stablecoin, which Paxos developed in partnership with Binance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance is finalizing the sale of its majority stake  
in crypto exchange Gopax to South Korean cloud service provider Megazone, local  
media publication The Chosun reported. This decision is pivotal for Gopax, one

governance issues remain unresolved.
Enhancing Governance
Currently, Binance holds a 72.6% stake in Streami, the  
operator of Gopax. However, the exchange plans to reduce its stake to around  
10% by selling shares to Megazone. This move is reportedly part of the exchange's initiative to enhance its governance structure, a requirement set by financial  
authorities to process a change report ahead of renewing Gopax's real-name  
account contract with Jeonbuk Bank.
