of cryptocurrency companies licensed by Singaporean authorities has just  
significantly increased. This surge is attributed to TerraPay, a payment  
service provider, and Blockchain.com, a platform that allows for the exchange

(MPI) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).
Blockchain.com Receives  
MPI License
The  
cryptocurrency exchange announced the acquisition of the license yesterday  
(Monday). This follows Blockchain.com receiving in-principle approval last  
year, in September 2022. The latest authorization allows them to offer

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stuart Alderoty, Ripple Labs’s Chief Legal Officer, took to Twitter to voice concerns over potential conflicts of interest involving former SEC official, Bill Hinman.
 
Alderoty tweeted, “Crypto critic/x-SEC official John Reed Stark says there should be an investigation into Bill Hinman. This is broader than Ripple – there could potentially be serious conflicts of interest by a gov official. An investigation will either put it to rest or hold folks accountable.”
 
The statement by Alderoty came in response to John Reed Stark, who pointed to the various reports of Bill Hinman’s conflicts of interest. According to former SEC official Stark, there should be an FBI investigation. If misconduct by Hinman comes to light, the U.S. Department of Justice should take action.

At the current pace, Ethereum is torching around 1.75 million ETH annually, leading to a decrease in supply by approximately 0.98%. Technically, the platform is becoming slightly deflationary since the circulating supply of ETH is shrinking over time as the network actively burns coins.

Litecoin Mining Hashrate Is Close To Setting A New All-Time High
 
Like Bitcoin, Litecoin is a proof-of-work (PoW) network, meaning that chain validators called miners have to compete against each other using computing power to get a chance of hashing the next block.
 
The “mining hashrate” is an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of such computing power that miners have currently connected to the Litecoin network.
 
This computing power can be expensive, as aside from the initial cost of setting up the mining rigs, there is also the continuous running cost in the form of electricity bills.
