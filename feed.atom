In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment discussed the altcoins currently witnessing a significant surge in network activity.
 
The relevant on-chain metric here is the “Daily Active Addresses,” which keeps track of the total number of addresses of a given asset that participates in some transaction activity daily. This indicator naturally takes into account both senders and receivers.
 
 
When the metric’s value is high, it means many addresses or users are making moves on the network right now. Such a trend implies that interest in cryptocurrency is currently high.
