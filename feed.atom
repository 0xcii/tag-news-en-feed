How $1,800 Turned Into $11 Million
 
On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post how a trader bought 5.1 million Dogwifhat (WIF) tokens for $1,749 on November 30 and has held them till now, with these tokens now worth $10.9 million.

Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading cryptocurrency, shattered its previous all-time high on Friday, reaching a staggering $70,199. This astronomical rise has ignited a firestorm of debate within the crypto community. Is this a sign of a resurgent bull market, or a fleeting frenzy before a correction?
 
 
Investor Jitters: Second Thoughts After The Surge
 
While the headlines scream record highs, a sense of cautious hesitation hangs in the air. The initial euphoria that accompanied Bitcoin’s $60,000 milestone appears to be fading, replaced by a wait-and-see approach from investors. This is evident in on-chain data from Santiment, which reveals signs of investor fatigue alongside a growing fascination with alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).
