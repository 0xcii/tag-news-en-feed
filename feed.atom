Rusty plans to restore several abandoned features from Bitcoin's code, a bold move that could significantly enhance the functionality and expressivity of Bitcoin scripts.

Understanding the New Costing Model
One of the central aspects of the "Great Script Restoration" proposal is the introduction of a new costing model for opcodes. Currently, in Bitcoin, every operation costs the same, regardless of its computational complexity. This model, however, does not accurately reflect the true cost of script execution, leading to potential inefficiencies and limitations.

Bitcoin allows for the permanent inscribing of data onto the public record. Still, whistleblowing on the blockchain remains a terrible idea.
