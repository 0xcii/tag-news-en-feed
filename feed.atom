        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius Network, has filed a motion to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuit against him. In the motion, Mashinsky argues the FTC has failed to allege he violated any laws or rules. His lawyers say the FTC is not entitled to monetary relief and cannot substantiate Mashinsky is currently violating the law.
 
Mashinsky Fights Back: Former Celsius CEO Challenges FTC Lawsuit, Claims No Legal Violations
 
In a memorandum filed September 11, 2023, Mashinsky’s legal team asserts the FTC complaint does not show he breached the Federal Trade Commission Act. His lawyers claim the FTC cannot seek monetary damages under the Act per a 2021 Supreme Court ruling.
 
“The complaint cannot substantiate a claim that Mashinsky ‘is violating’ or is ‘about to violate’ the law because Mashinsky resigned from his position as CEO of Celsius [on] September 27, 2023,” the court filing reads.
 
The memorandum states the FTC’s allegations fail to support that Mashinsky knowingly made false statements to deceptively obtain customer data. This purportedly does not meet the requirements to allege a violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Mashinsky’s lawyers also contend the FTC has not demonstrated grounds for monetary relief under the Act.
 
 
In their filing, Mashinsky’s attorneys ask the court to dismiss the FTC’s Federal Trade Commission Act and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act claims against him. They argue the complaint does not establish that Mashinsky broke any laws or regulations. When he was officially charged by the FTC, Mashinsky “vehemently” denied the allegations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past ten years, fervent supporters of digital currency have engaged in intense debates: Is bitcoin (BTC) designed as peer-to-peer electronic cash as illustrated in Satoshi’s groundbreaking white paper, or does it serve as a digital store of value, similar to gold? Additionally, a central question emerges regarding the primary role of money: should its capacity as a medium of exchange take precedence over its value preservation attributes? The following Learning and Insights explainer delves into the Austrian school of economics, shining a spotlight on Carl Menger’s “On the Origins of Money.”

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Supply Has Plummeted Into Losses
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, only 16.3% of the short-term holder supply is in profit right now. The relevant indicator here is the “percent supply in profit,” which measures the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply carrying some gains.
 
This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved/transferred at. If this previous selling price was less than the current spot price, then that particular coin currently carries a profit.
 
The counterpart indicator to the supply in profit is the “suppl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has warned that it is “a huge mistake” to think that the U.S. economy will boom “for years” given that there are so many risks out there. The executive stressed: “I just think people make a mistake to look at real-time numbers and not look at the future. And the future has quantitative tightening. We’ve been spending money like drunken sailors around the world.”
 
Jamie Dimon’s Economic Warning
 
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned about where the U.S. economy is headed at the Barclays 21st Annual Global Financial Services Conference in New York on Monday.
 
The executive cautioned: “I just think people make a mistake to look at real-time numbers and not look at the future. And the future has quantitative tightening. We’ve been spending money like drunken sailors around the world, this war in Ukraine is still going on.” Dimon emphasized:
 

To say the consumer is strong today, meaning you are going to have a booming environment for years, is a huge mistake.
 
“If and when you have a recession, which you’re eventually going to have, you’ll have a normal credit cycle, which I think is quite predictable. In a normal credit cycle, something always does worse than normal,” he described.
 
The JPMorgan boss opined: “There’s a lot of fiscal stimulus taking place out there. And the large one from Covid is still running through. The largest QE is still running through. So we’re still living on that, and that’s really strong. And of course, that drives everything, including business results.”
 
 
Dimon further explained that “businesses feel pretty good because they look at their current results” and see that “they’re not so bad.” However, he cautioned:
 

But those things change. And we don’t know what the full effect of all these things are going to be 12 or 18 months from now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent development surrounding the high-profile Federal Trade Commission (FTC) case against the crypto platform Celsius, former CEO Alex Mashinsky requested that a New York district court dismiss the charges against him.
 
The core of his argument rests on the timeline of his resignation from the firm and the subsequent charges by the FTC.
 
 
Why Mashinsky Seeks Dismissal
 
In a recent court filing, Mashinsky’s legal team argued that the FTC’s case against their client should be dismissed. The legal defense bases its argument on the assertion that the regulatory body cannot “substantiate a claim that Mashinsky ‘is violating’ or is ‘about to violate’ the law.” 
 
This is primarily because he relinquished his position as the CEO of Celsius on September 27, 2023. Such nuances in legal p…]]></summary>
