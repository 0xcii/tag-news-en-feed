        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Jan. 31, 2024, a notable movement of so-called ‘sleeping bitcoins’ occurred, involving wallets from 2013 and 2016 which collectively transferred 845.06 bitcoins valued at approximately $35.96 million. Originating from a handful of distinct addresses, 726 bitcoins were likely the property of a single entity, considering the patterns observed.
 
$35 Million in Long-Dormant Bitcoins Make a Sudden Move
 
At precisely block height 828,276, which occurred on Wednesday afternoon, an unidentified party initiated the movement of 118.93 BTC, marking its first transaction in a span exceeding a decade and two months. The wallet, identified as “1PUeG” by the blockchain parser web portal btcparser.com, intriguingly left the corresponding 118.93 bitcoin cash (BCH) untouched.

The Fed’s Role In Operation Chokepoint 2.0
 
Murphy’s scrutiny centers on the Federal Reserve’s handling of the master account application from Custodia Bank. A master account is critical for banks to access essential services like check clearing, wire transfers, and Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments.
