‘The Fed Has Lost’
 
Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff issued more warnings about the U.S. economy in a podcast Sunday. Commenting on the Nasdaq, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones rallying in June even though the Federal Reserve has not started cutting interest rates and has indicated that it is going to hike some more, he opined:
 

I think it’s because the markets don’t really believe the Fed. They know the Fed is likely near the end or done hiking, and so that is the relief rally.

But this time very well could be different, as LTCUSD is exhibiting more similarities with a previous point — just before an incredible breakout performance. With a comparable technical setup returning, will the altcoin soar like the last time? Or like past halvings, is the top already in?
 
The Looming Litecoin Halving Paradox
 
Ask the average Bitcoiner, and they’ll tell you the same thing. “Wait until after the halving.” After several recurring cycles, a large majority is convinced that the BTC halving alone drives price increases.
 
Meanwhile, in Litecoin, it’s viewed as a “sell the news” style event where price peaks well ahead of the halving then simply g…]]></summary>

 In the US, it’s been a turbulent situation with regulatory bodies and some politicians behaving hostile to crypto, while BlackRock, which is filing an ETF application, has opened up the possibility of a more welcoming environment. In the EU, MiCA has been approved, creating the impression of a continent moving quickly towards crypto acceptance and looking to set a global standard. Additionally, Asia, Hong Kong and Singapore are often mentioned as potential crypto hubs, while Japan, too, appears to be taking an open-minded approach.
