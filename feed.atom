        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its  
creation in 2011, Litecoin (LTC) has remained a notable digital asset in the  
fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies. Its historical significance as a crypto  
pioneer cannot be overstated. However, in today's ever-changing crypto market,  
where does Litecoin stand, and what lays ahead for it?
The Unique  
Beginnings of Litecoin
Litecoin arose  
from a desire to address some of Bitcoin's restrictions. Litecoin sought to  
provide faster transaction confirmations and reduced costs by using an  
alternative hashing algorithm called Scrypt. This distinguishing feature  
distinguished it from its older sibling, Bitcoin, as a potential solution for  
everyday transactions and micropayments.
Litecoin has

The cryptocurrency exchange promptly took precautionary actions to mitigate the risks associated with a 51% attack, a situation that arises when a single entity controls over half of the computational power on a blockchain network.
 
Coinbase’s Mitigation Measures
 
Upon detecting this significant centralization in the Zcash network, Coinbase promptly increased the Zcash confirmation requirement to 110 block confirmations, elongating deposit times from an average 40 minutes to roughly 2.5 hours.

In the ongoing hack, cybercriminals have hijacked the front-end website of the DeFi protocol to rob users’ wallets by forcing them to approve malicious contracts. 
 
The Balancer Protocol affirmed the recent hack through its X account (previously known as Twitter) around 11:50 PM UTC on September 19. The DeFi protocol prohibited users from accessing its official website balancer.fi, until the team solves the issue and confirms via a notice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin retreated from recent highs on Wednesday, ahead of the upcoming U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate announcement. The Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged, despite inflation rising by more than expected in August. Ethereum also gave up gains in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin started the day trading marginally lower, as markets prepared for the highly anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate decision.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,918.32 on Wednesday, following a peak at $27,488.76 the day prior.
 
In addition to the rate decision, the FOMC will give an economic forecast, which could provide some forward guidance on future policy decisions.

One of the catalysts for the drop in price was the relative strength index (RSI), which fell below a ceiling at the 60.00 mark.
 
The index is now tracking around the 57.08 level, and is moving towards a support point at 55.00.
 
Overall, momentum remains largely bullish, with today’s decline largely due to profit taking ahead of the Fed announcement.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also slipped lower during today’s session, which can also be attributed to traders opting to secure gains.
 
Following a high of $1,669.02 on Tuesday, ETH/USD dropped to a low of $1,621.36 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency fell close to a support point of $1,620.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Price has since rebounded, with ethereum trading at $1,631 at the time of writing, owing to bulls choosing to reject a breakout.
 
An earlier failed breakout attempt seems to be the reason for the decline, with the RSI unable to rise above a ceiling of 49.00.
 
Price strength now sits at 45.72, with a floor of 40.00 a possible target for short sellers.

An Introduction to DAOs
A DAO, or  
Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a digital entity that works  
autonomously through code, allowing its members to collaboratively rule and  
make decisions. It runs on a blockchain, which is a distributed ledger system,  
and follows predetermined rules without the need for centralized control.

With the community’s attention largely directed towards Drivechains, Jameson Lopp, a Bitcoin OG, dives into the intricacies of the Spiderchain system in his recent blog post. Here’s an in-depth look at the proposal and its implications for the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems.
 
Why Spiderchain?
 
In Lopp’s analysis of the Botanix whitepaper, he notes that while there are many proposals geared towards enhancing Bitcoin’s Layer 2 capabilities, such as drivechains, zero knowledge rollups, and validity rollups, Spiderchain distinguishes itself by being immediately implementable on the existing Bitcoin protocol.

They group a bunch of tasks and compute them offchain, only posting the result of these transactions to Ethereum, allowing more data to be piled up on L1 (layer one). Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has been pushing rollups as part of the future of Ethereum scaling since 2020, and with the proposal of Danksharding, its scaling roadmap has become rollup-centric.
Rollups and the Scalability Problem
