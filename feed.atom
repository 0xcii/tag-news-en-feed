XRP Whales Have Been Expanding Their Holdings Recently
 
As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the XRP whales have shown significant net expansion during the past ten days. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the amount of XRP that a given wallet group is currently holding.
 
 
The addresses or investors are placed into these cohorts based on the total number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins group, for instance, includes all holders who own between 1 and 10 XRP.

However, despite this outcome, Consensys maintains  
that the SEC is overstepping its regulatory authority, particularly concerning  
MetaMask, one of its key products. The US District Court for the Northern District of
