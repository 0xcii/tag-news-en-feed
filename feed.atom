Cryptocurrency Derivative Market Has Registered High Liquidations Today
 
According to data from CoinGlass, the derivative side of the cryptocurrency market has suffered some major liquidations in the past day following the volatility that assets like Bitcoin have gone through.
 
The “liquidation” of a contract takes place when it amasses losses of a certain degree, leading to the derivative exchange with which it’s open to forcibly close it off.
 
 
Below is a table that shows the information about the liquidation event that has occurred in the cryptocurrency sector over the last day:

One of the longest running criticisms of Bitcoin is that it is not possible to make arbitrary programs to control how money is spent or locked. Bitcoin only has a very limited amount of programmability in its scripting language, and the primitives available are extremely constrained.

Robin’s insight with BitVM was that one single primitive in the field of computing could be enforced in Bitcoin script: a NAND gate, one of th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Talos, a provider of institutional trading technology  
for digital assets, has partnered with Coinbase Derivatives, LLC, to expand the  
platforms available for institutional investors seeking to invest in digital  
assets within a regulated framework. The integration of Talos with Coinbase Derivatives  
enables investors to access a regulated futures exchange offering  
Bitcoin and ether futures contracts.
Exploring Institutional Crypto Derivatives
According to the press release, these contracts, sized  
at 1 Bitcoin and 10 ether, cater specifically to the needs of institutional  
investors. They provide a capital-efficient tool for managing crypto market  
exposure without the complexities of direct asset custody.
Daniel Packham, the VP and Head of Operations for EMEA  
at Talos, mentioned: "The derivatives markets are a significant component  
of the digital assets ecosystem for institutions who seek secure, liquid, and  
increasingly regulated venues for trading. We have seen a lot of interest and growth in our  
derivatives business, and our integration with Coinbase Derivatives will expand  
the universe of regulated futures that clients can access using the Talos  
platform."
Coinbase Derivatives offers nano-sized contracts  
tailored for retail investors to allow for more accessible participation in  
crypto derivatives trading. Talos' clients can leverage the liquidity of Coinbase  
Derivatives' futures contracts through algorithms, including Talos's Multileg  
algorithm, which facilitates the implementation of trading strategies.
Talos provides the technology supporting digital  
assets for institutional investors. From liquidity sourcing to settlement and  
portfolio management, the Talos platform connects institutions to key  
participants in the digital asset space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arkon Energy US Holdco LLC, a leading player in Bitcoin mining infrastructure, has placed a significant order with Bitmain Development Pte. Ltd. for 27,700 new-generation Bitcoin mining machines, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. This purchase includes 14,200 T21 machines and 13,500 S21 machines, with deliveries slated to commence in June 2024.
“We are very excited to announce the purchase order of 6 EH/s worth of new generation Antminer S21s and T21s from Bitmain,” said Founder and Chairman, Josh Payne. “This transaction marks a turning point for Arkon, as we become a vertically integrated operator of both Hosting and Self Mining infrastructure across our portfolio of data centers in Texas and Ohio.”
Arkon, traditionally a hosting provider for Bitcoin mining customers, is pivoting towards self-mining operations with this purchase. The new machines boast an aggregate portfolio efficiency of less than 19 joules per terahash (J/TH), positioning Arkon to become one of the most efficient players in the Bitcoin mining sector post the upcoming halving event in April.
Currently operating with 117MW of approved capacity across two data centers in Ohio, Arkon has plans for significant expansion. They have binding agreements in place to develop additional sites in the United States, potentially boosting their operating capacity to 307MW, subject to successful funding and site development.
“Arkon has spent the last two years consolidating the distressed market for data center assets in some of the lowest-cost power markets in North America,” Payne continued. “Now we are taking the next step to vertically integrate the business with a purchase of a fleet of new generation miners, aiming to make Arkon one of the most efficient miners in the world.”
The news follows Arkon's announcement last week to list on Euronext Amsterdam through a business combination with BM3EAC Corp.]]></summary>

Why Dogecoin Price Is Down This Week
 
Dogecoin started out Tuesday on a sour note, dropping more than 10% in the 24-hour period as well. This decline is not attributed to a single thing that happened to DOGE, though, but rather a market-wide decline that began with Bitcoin.
 
 
Following the release of the March manufacturing data in the US, the market responded negatively. The report shows that while manufacturing in the country had actually increased for the first time in two years, there wasn’t an increase in employment at these factories.

The anticipation surrounding the potential approval has been met with several setbacks, including a lack in communication between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and ETF applicants, as well as an ongoing investigation by the SEC into the Ethereum Foundation regarding the classification of Ethereum as a security.
 
Following this, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently adjusted the odds of the ETF’s approval by May 23, the final deadline for one of the applications, to a mere 25%. This adjustment comes amidst growing skepticism over the immediate future of Ether…]]></summary>
