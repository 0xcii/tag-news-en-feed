Capitol Honors Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin Vision
 
The recognition took place as part of the Capitol Flag Program, where the American flag was flown above the Capitol in honor of Nakamoto’s creation, described by Warren’s office as “the first truly inclusive financial system,” according to Bitcoin Magazine.

These products were approved and launched in January, which is significant in itself, but what has followed is a hugely impressive start, which has seen net flows for all BTC ETFs cumulatively surpass $3 billion, while two of the funds (IBIT and FBTC) are already–despite being only around a month old–in the top ten funds for year-to-date flows.
