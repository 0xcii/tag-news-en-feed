"We are honoured to partner with such prestigious entities in the financial and technological sectors," Saturn's official X (Twitter) account, stated.

This investment does not merely represent financial backing; it embodies a shared belief in a Bitcoin-centric future and the role Saturn will play in shaping it."
The funding round is to support Saturn's mission to redefine possibilities within the realm of Bitcoin. These investments aim to propel the development of new infrastructure tailored to foster a seamless ecosystem for fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network.
“I see a future where Bitcoin can onboard millions of users to Bitcoin, bringing a fungible token experience that is familiar to that of an experience on Ethereum or Solana,” said Hex, Founder of Saturn.
