This has created a narrative that the SOL network might indeed be ready to take over Ethereum’s position as the King of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). 
 
Jupiter Surpasses Uniswap In Trading Volume 
 
According to CoinGeko, Jupiter has recorded over $510 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours, surpassing Ethereum’s Uniswap V3 and V2, which recorded $455 and $76 million respectively. Jupiter’s recent dominance is believed to be partly due to the recent WEN airdrop that occurred on its launchpad.

The cash holding almost doubled from $2.3 billion at the end of October, according to Chapter 11 monthly operating reports.
Selling Crypto for Cash
First reported by Bloomberg, the bankruptcy administrators of the crypto exchange sold its crypto assets to raise $1.8 billion last month. The figure only considers the four largest affiliates, including FTX Trading Ltd and Alameda Research LLC, meaning it could go higher if all the affiliates are considered.
The exchange additionally confirmed trading derivatives to hedge exposure on its digital asset holdings and earned extra yield.
