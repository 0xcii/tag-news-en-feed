        <updated>2023-08-03T13:48:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tether, the company behind the world’s most popular stablecoin USDT, acquired 1,529 bitcoin in the second quarter of 2023.
Paolo Ardoino, the company’s CTO, confirmed the purchase to Bitcoin Magazine. According to the executive, Tether paid roughly $45.4 million to add the BTC to its balance sheet.
The purchase confirms the company is following the plans it delineated earlier this year. Tether announced in May that it would start allocating up to 15% of quarterly profits to bitcoin, a move that could challenge popular bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, executive chairman of software intelligence firm MicroStrategy.
Nasdaq-listed MicroStrategy this week announced it acquired 467 BTC in July. Bitcoin has been hovering around the $30,000 mark for a couple months, and the stability seems to have prompted Saylor to pull the trigger and add $14.4 million worth of BTC to the company’s treasury. MicroStrategy currently holds 152,800 BTC, while Tether owns over 54,000 BTC with the Q2 buy.
Bitcoin’s nearly 76% jump year-to-date is renewing institutional interest in the digital currency, with the world’s largest asset manager filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in June. Many asset managers fast-followed $8.6 trillion BlackRock to re-file their previously denied applications. 
While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has denied plenty of similar filings in the past, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts yesterday coined a 65% chance that BlackRock’s filing receives the regulatory green light. Notably, BlackRock’s ETF applications have been denied only once, out of roughly 550 filings.
The eventual approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is broadly seen as bullish by the market, and companies such as Tether and MicroStrategy would be set to benefit the most from the assumed price appreciation of the coin. Coincidently, the deadline for the SEC to issue a decision on most of these ETF applications aligns closely with the Bitcoin halving – another event widely perceived as positive for the future of bitcoin’s price.]]></summary>

These dollar-tied tokens have rapidly gained momentum, witnessing substantial growth in market capitalization soon after their debut.
 
A Look at Aave’s GHO and First Digital’s FDUSD Growth
 
In mid-July, the decentralized finance (defi) lending protocol Aave approved a governance proposal and unveiled the platform’s gho (GHO) stablecoin. On July 17, 2023, there were 2,510,269 GHO tokens in circulation, and now there are more than 11.25 million GHO. This implies that GHO’s supply expanded by over 348% within the last 16 days.

The research, which examined over 3 million tweets related to 18 different cryptocurrencies from January 2019 to January 2023, has uncovered startling revelations about the influence of bot activity on the market.
 
 
Clear signs of price manipulation were evident in coins like The Sandbox (SAND), Gods Unchained (GODS), and LooksRare (LOOKS) due to inauthentic tweet volumes, as indicated by the study. Twitter bot activity played a substantial role in amplifying the value of these altcoins.

Their main objective is to impose stronger restrictions in order to close the crypto tax gap, which experts estimate to be at least $50 billion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was once again trading below the $29,000 level on Thursday, as bulls retreated following yesterday’s gains. The drop appeared to come as traders secured profits, following a failed breakout of a key price point. Ethereum also edged lower today. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $29,000 zone in today’s session, as bulls appeared to have abandoned their positions following Wednesday’s gains.
 
After peaking at $29,988.00 yesterday, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $28,946.51 earlier in the day.
 
This comes as the bullish sentiment surrounding Microstrategy’s latest BTC investment seems to have already faded.
 
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) failed to move past a key ceiling at 50.00, and has bounded off a floor at 42.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 42.79, with BTC climbing back above the $29,000 mark as a result.
 
Price may now consolidate, as traders’ attention turns to Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) also moved lower earlier in the day, dropping below a support point of $1,850 in the process.
 
ETH/USD bottomed out at $1,822.35 during today’s session, following Wednesday’s high at $1,860.19.
 
As a result of today’s decline, ethereum moved back towards a four-week low at $1,812.
 
 
The slippage took place after the RSI fell below a floor at the 45.00 level, and it is now at a reading of 41.93.
 
Should momentum continue to drop, the next price target will likely be the $1,795 level.

I’ve recently returned from spending a long weekend with around 200,000 others at one of the loves of my life, Glastonbury Festival. The 2023 version of this annual music festival was peppered with sets from big name acts — Elton John, Guns N’ Roses and Foo Fighters, to name a few — but the inevitable media focus on these tends to mislead those viewing it from the outside. Glastonbury is a phenomenon of vast scale; it could be described as 10 festivals wrapped into one. Nearly everyone who goes will tell you they’ve had a great time, but probably all for different reasons.
