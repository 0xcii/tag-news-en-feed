        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has responded to a recent statement by Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, with a sharp criticism of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Grewal questioned the SEC’s understanding of investment contracts in connection with cryptocurrencies.
 
He emphasized that the term “investments” does not inherently constitute “investment contracts” and pointed out that investment contracts must entail rights to the future income, profits, or assets of an enterprise. This view aligns with the SEC’s own stance in the Edwards case presented before the Supreme Court, where the SEC described investment contracts as having the character of “debt [or] equity participation.”

Currently there are many issues with seamless integration of Bitcoin to fiat exchanges inside of applications, chief among them being lack of Lightning support by many brokerages. In addition to that, each brokerage service in the market builds proprietary APIs for integration with their services, increasing the overhead of integration of multiple options by application and wallet developers. Breez SDK’s support for the FiatLink API can facilitate a single solution to both problems.
FiatLink, as an open interface standard, would also allow seamless integration of multiple brokerage options inside a Lightning application or wallet. Rather than h…]]></summary>

This can happen gradually then suddenly, but resistance will be there. People do not easily change their world views. We (Americans) are about to experience the next chapter in the great monetary war, by way of a Bitcoin ETF approval. This approval will change the course of Bitcoin adoption for better or worse, and is a good reason to be warned of what is to come.
The Bitcoin ETF approval will send a huge message to money managers around the world, that is that “We, the US Government, deem bitcoin a safe asset for you to invest in”. Now If you're like me, you could care less what the SEC says or does, this is freedom money. But for millions of people across America, this is a big green flag that i…]]></summary>

The prospective green light for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a hot topic, with traders mulling over whether it’ll catalyze a “buy the rumor sell the news” scenario or herald a significantly bullish turn.
 
Bitcoin
 
There’s a tangible sense of anticipation for the SEC’s verdict, believed by many to have been factored into the past quarter’s bitcoin price movements. Approval might initiate a temporary dip in BTC’s value as traders harvest profits, yet there remains a chance for an unexpected rally, potentially driving prices north of $50K.
