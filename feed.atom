As California’s legislative session concludes, two pivotal crypto regulatory bills, AB 39 and SB 401, stand on the cusp of becoming state law.

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoins-first-trade-now-worth-130-million-"/>
        <updated>2023-10-12T14:35:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fourteen years ago today, on October 12, 2009, a historic moment unfolded in the world of Bitcoin as Bitcoin saw its first-ever trade for U.S. dollars. 
This pivotal event, orchestrated by Martti "Sirius" Malmi, a developer who worked with Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto on some of its earliest software versions, marked the birth of its circular economy.
In this inaugural trade, Malmi exchanged 5,050 Bitcoins for a mere $5.02, valuing each Bitcoin at a fraction of a cent. 
Fast forward to the present day, and the price appreciation of Bitcoin has been nothing short of astounding. With Bitcoin's current value exceeding $26,000 per coin, that humble $5 trade from 2009 is now worth an astonishing $130 million. 
This exceptional price growth over the years has made early Bitcoin enthusiasts and adopters witnesses to a true financial revolution.
The trade was revealed by Malmi in 2014, when he wrote on Twitter (now X): "Found the first known bitcoin to USD transaction from my email backups. I sold 5,050 BTC for $5.02 on 2009-10-12."
The tweet was resurfaced today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo.
This remarkable milestone not only highlights the dramatic increase in Bitcoin's value but also serves as a testament to the innovation and resilience of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's ability to disrupt traditional financial systems and establish itself as a store of value has reshaped the financial landscape. It continues to draw attention from investors, institutions, and individuals seeking financial freedom and security.
As the Bitcoin community celebrates the 14th anniversary of the first U.S. dollar trade, it's an opportunity to reflect on the profound impact this digital currency has had on the world of finance. The legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto, Martti Malmi, and countless others who have contributed to Bitcoin's growth remains a testament to the ongoing evolution of the revolution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ongoing trial against Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), former founder of the FTX crypto exchange, coupled with the testimonies of Caroline Ellison, the ex-CEO of Alameda Research and his former romantic partner, has unveiled a slew of crazy stories and intrigues. Given the rapid pace and depth of these developments, we’ve distilled the most jaw-dropping moments.
 
SBF And Ellison’s Manipulated Bitcoin Price
 
In a sensational revelation, Caroline Ellison admitted that there was a coordinated effort between her and SBF to maintain Bitcoin’s price below $20,000. “Keep selling BTC if it’s over $20K,” Ellison allegedly noted from one of their conversations. The motivation behind this move, according to Ellison, was to entice investors by selling equity, thus raising more funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below the $27,000 level on Thursday, ahead of the upcoming inflation report in the United States. Consumer prices are expected to have risen by 3.6% in September, down 0.1% from the month prior. Ethereum plunged to a multi-week low.
 
Bitcoin
 

 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell for a fifth consecutive day, as markets prepared for the release of last month’s U.S. consumer price index (CPI)
 

 
BTC/USD dropped to a low of $26,561.10 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $27,258.45.
 

 
Thursday’s sell-off has seen the world’s largest cryptocurrency remain near its lowest point since the end of September.
 

 

 

 
Looking at the chart, the move pushed the relative strength index (RSI) to a support point at the 44.00 level.
 

 
Price strength has since marginally rebounded, and at the time of writing, is tracking at 45.28.
 

 
This floor may serve as a buffer ahead of the inflation report, which could then trigger an increase in volatility.
 

 

 
Ethereum
 

 
Ethereum (ETH) also experienced a plunge in price, with the cryptocurrency falling to a multi-week low.
 

 
Following a high of $1,576.40 on Wednesday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,538.26 earlier in the session.
 

 
As a result, ethereum has now fallen to its weakest point since September 11, when the price traded below its $1,540 support point.
 

 

 

 
The downtrend comes following a recent crossover of the 10-day (red) moving average and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 

 
Due to this bearish momentum, the RSI has fallen to a current reading of 36.88, which suggests volumes are marginally oversold.
 

 
This could prompt bulls to consider buying the dip, depending on today’s inflation report.

Stablecoins  
Explained
Before  
evaluating their performance in times of market upheaval, it's  
critical to understand what stablecoins represent. Stablecoins are a type  
of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a consistent value. This is  
often accomplished by tying their value to a reserve asset such as a fiat  
currency (for example, USD) or a commodity (for example, gold). This pegging  
technique protects against the significant price volatility seen with other  
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of crypto trading, there are many ways to identify opportunities, one of the most prominent methods being technical analysis. This is the study and general breaking down of charts using various indicators and charting patterns. One such technique is known as Support and Resistance strategy. 
 
Support
 

 
A support, which is also known as a floor, is the lower horizontal line holding up price at a certain level. You can identify a floor by drawing a line in the area you believe the price hits but rarely moves below. A simple strategy some traders use is buying at the floor because they have seen the markets go up each time price hits that level.
 

 

 

 

 
Resistance
 

 
On the other hand, a resistance (upper horizontal line) is the ceiling and reverse of the floor. When the market hits a ceiling, prices fall back down towards the floor. Traders sometimes sell when they see the price has hit a resistance.
 

 

 
Breakout
 

 
Lastly, traders use these lines to identify opportunities for a breakout. A breakout is where both support and resistance is used to anticipate the point where price escapes consolidation. When the markets break out of the resistance traders normally look to buy. When the markets break out of the floor they look to sell. This strategy signals a shift in price momentum in the direction where the breakout takes place.

Zuckerberg’s Take On Bitcoin
 
In the exchange between McCormack and Marcus, the former asked, “You might not want to answer, but is Zuck a Bitcoiner?” Marcus affirmed, “Yeah, yeah, yeah. He appreciates Bitcoin but I think we had a lot of conversations about this [Libra], especially when I was struggling to see how we can decentralize this thing enough.”
