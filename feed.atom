Many supporters and market observers anticipate a price increase prior to the event. According to an anonymous market analyst known as Plan B, bitcoin’s price could ascend to between $40,000 and $50,000 in the run-up to the next block reward halving.

The initial intention was for the partnership between Binance’s Argentina division and the Argentine Football Association to span five years.
