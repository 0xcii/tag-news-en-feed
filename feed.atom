        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/aave-launches-gho-stablecoin-on-ethereum-network/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-17T19:39:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aave, a prominent lending protocol within the decentralized finance (defi) sphere, has unveiled GHO, a new stablecoin, which is now live on the Ethereum network. Aave users can now mint the stablecoin asset by leveraging Aave version three (v3).
 
Aave’s Dollar-Pegged GHO Token Goes Live on Ethereum
 
This week, on July 14, 2023, Aave’s community approved a governance proposal, swiftly followed by the much-awaited launch of the stablecoin GHO on the Ethereum network. GHO, initially announced in July 2022, had a test run on Ethereum’s Goerli testnet in February 2023. In line with the information from the Github repository, the newly debuted stablecoin, and its affiliated smart contract underwent multiple audits.
 
Currently, GHO is relatively insignificant when compared with the top ten heavyweights of the stablecoin world, especially when considering circulating dollar-pegged coins. The circulating supply of GHO stands around 2,510,269 tokens, representing a meager 0.0016% of the overall $127 billion stablecoin economy. At 12:20 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, GHO hit a trough at $0.9813, yet so far, it has generally maintained its peg to the dollar.
 
 
Emulating numerous stablecoin assets, individuals can gather interest with Aave’s freshly debuted GHO stablecoin. Users who stake the AAVE token are also rewarded with an extra 30% discount on current GHO borrowing rates. Thus far, there are approximately 234 GHO holders, and since the mainnet inception, a total of 893 transactions have been logged. Data sourced from coinmarketcap.com reveals that GHO has seen roughly $1,437,756 in worldwide trading volume over the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now Pointing At “Neutral”
 
The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency sector. The metric uses a scale that runs from 0-100 for representing this sentiment.
 
When the value of the index is lower than 46, it means that the investors are fearful right now. On the other hand, values above 54 suggest that the market is greedy at the moment. The region between these two thresholds of 46 and 54 belongs to the neutral sentiment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a mere fortnight, the Litecoin network is poised for its third reward halving event, a seismic shift that will slash the LTC miners’ block rewards from 12.5 LTC per block down to 6.25 LTC. Data illustrates an intensified dedication of hashrate to the Litecoin blockchain as the critical halving deadline draws near.
 
Litecoin Reward Halving Draws Near
 
Over the last two weeks, litecoin (LTC) has seen a notable descent, depreciating approximately 17% in value against the U.S. dollar. However, casting the gaze back a full month reveals a contrasting picture, with LTC capturing a gain of roughly 18%. In just 15 days, the Litecoin network stands on the precipice of its third halving.

This run is still continuing as of Monday morning, but the rally is being threatened by a single whale transaction seen on the blockchain just a couple of hours ago.
 
Whale Deposits $3.88 Million In 1inch To Binance
 
On-chain data tracker Lookonchain, on Monday, flagged a transaction that could negatively affect 1inch’s current price rally. The transaction was made by a whale carrying a total of 7 million 1inch tokens.
 
 
Now, such transactions are not out of the ordinary given that whales tend to move their coins around a lot. However, what is of concern here is the destination of the coins.

The positive outlook follows Ripple’s partial victory in its legal battle against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
US Banks Want To Use XRP
 
Alderoty revealed that Ripple plans to initiate discussions with U.S.-based financial firms in the coming quarter regarding the adoption of the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, which utilizes XRP as a bridge between fiat currencies for seamless cross-border payments.
 
When asked if the recent court ruling would generate increased interest from banks, Alderoty confidently replied, “I think the answer to that is yes.”…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has successfully integrated Bitcoin (BTC) onto the Lightning Network, enabling faster and more efficient transactions. As of today, users can now deposit and withdraw Bitcoin (BTC) using the Lightning Network on the Binance platform.
The integration of Bitcoin on the Lightning Network marks a significant milestone for Binance, as it aims to enhance the speed and scalability of Bitcoin transactions. By leveraging the Lightning Network, Binance aims to address the scalability challenges associated with the Bitcoin network, allowing users to enjoy faster and cheaper transactions. Previously, Binance has experienced issues in high fee environments, most recently highlighted when Bitcoin inscriptions caused a surge in fees. 
With the Lightning Network integration, Binance users can now take advantage of the Lightning Network's off-chain payment channels to send and receive bitcoin transactions with reduced fees and faster settlement times. This development comes just as Lightning is being integrated into other exchange platforms, essentially becoming an expectation for quick and easy bitcoin transactions. Just last week, a European exchange named Coinfinity also integrated the Lightning Network, with plans for further integration down the road. 
According to the official announcement by Binance, users can find their assigned bitcoin deposit addresses on the Lightning Network within the Deposit Crypto page on the platform. The exchange has also provided a FAQ section to guide users on how to deposit bitcoin using the Lightning Network.
The integration of the Lightning Network for bitcoin transactions is expected to bring tangible benefits to Binance users, offering them a faster and more cost-effective way to engage with the leading cryptocurrency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Geyser, a leading Bitcoin grant organization, has announced the launch of its fifth Bitcoin grant, aimed at supporting educational initiatives and community-based programs focused on Bitcoin. The grant opens up opportunities for campaigns that promote and bolster Bitcoin schools and communities worldwide. 
Mick Morucci, CEO of Geyser, emphasized the importance of Bitcoin for underserved populations, stating, "These are the people that would most benefit from bitcoin, which can act as a shield. These are also those that are least aware of bitcoin." The grant seeks to amplify the efforts of Bitcoin communities that are emerging across the globe, offering knowledge, education and tools to promote participation in the Bitcoin movement.
To fund the grant, Geyser has raised 1 BTC, thanks to generous donors and a partnership with Blink. The organization aims to distribute the proceeds to numerous projects that demonstrate impact, need and proof of work. Applications for the grant are currently open and will be accepted until mid-August. A board will evaluate the projects and select the most deserving recipients.
Geyser Grants stands apart from typical Bitcoin grants, which primarily focus on core developers. The organization aims to recognize and reward all Bitcoin creators for their contributions. Geyser Grants has already made a significant impact, contributing 2.2 BTC to over 100 projects centered around Bitcoin education, creative endeavors, and community building.
The grants serve multiple purposes, including promoting Bitcoin awareness, encouraging contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem, recognizing important work in the space, empowering creators globally and fostering the growth of the Bitcoin creator ecosystem. To learn more about the grant or to apply, interested individuals can visit the Geyser Grants Round 5 page.]]></summary>
