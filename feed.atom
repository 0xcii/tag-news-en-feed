        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to reports, the Trump Organization—the holding company of former US President Donald Trump’s business ventures—would be moving on to present a new cryptocurrency initiative. In an interview, Eric Trump, the son of the ex-president and executive vice president of the organization, revealed that the new venture would deal with “digital real estate” and one would be capable of lending or borrowing money over the platform.
 
 
The announcement comes at a time when the Trump family has been vocal about their enthusiasm for cryptocurrency on social media.
