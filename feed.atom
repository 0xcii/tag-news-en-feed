U.S. authorities have collared 40-year-old China-resident Anatoly Legkodymov on claims that his Hong Kong-registered crypto trading platform, Bitzlato, processed hundreds of millions of dollars in dirty money.
 
Tuesday night, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation apprehended Legkodymov in Miami.
 
The DOJ said on Wednesday that Bitzlato has been taken offline as part of an “international cryptocurrency enforcement operation.”
