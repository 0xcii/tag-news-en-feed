        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e74a9db9210</id>
        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-extends-recent-gains-rising-to-8-week-high/"/>
        <updated>2023-10-24T15:37:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP rose for a fourth straight day on Tuesday, as overall sentiment in the market was mostly bullish. The global crypto market cap is nearly 10% higher at the time of writing, with the likes of bitcoin trading at a 17-month high. Cardano also surged, recording a 2-month peak.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was one of Tuesday’s biggest movers, as the token rose by as much as 10% today.
 
After trading at a low of $0.5267 on Monday, XRP/USD climbed to a peak of $0.581 earlier in the day.
 
This surge resulted in XRP rising to its highest point since August 18, when price was on the cusp of breaking into the $0.60 region.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the move came after the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should bulls intend to maintain this recent round of momentum, they will first need to break a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI) of 72.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 71.70.
 
 
Cardano (ADA )
 
Additionally, cardano (ADA) rallied to a multi-month high during today’s session, breaking a key resistance level in the process.
 
ADA/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $0.2911 on Tuesday, after starting the week trading at a low of $0.2626.
 
Today’s surge in price has sent the cryptocurrency to its strongest level since August 13, and comes after six days of consecutive gains.
 
 
This has resulted in price strength now residing in overbought territory, with a current reading of 75.70.
 
Looking back at the chart, this is the highest the index has hit since January, and was the catalyst for bulls to break a price ceiling of $0.280.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) has undoubtedly been one of the major winners of the recent crypto rally after notching over 60% gains on the weekly chart. Since it has grown so much, expectations of a downside are common. However, one crypto analyst is bucking this trend as they see a continued breakout for the altcoin.
 
Solana To Breakout To $55
 
In the post shared by crypto analyst Babenski on TradingView, we can see where the analyst expects the price of Solana to end up. The chart which already shows Solana’s price surge above $30 suggests an almost 100% leg-up from this high level.
 
 
Babenski uses the Solana weekly chart in which they see the price breaking out. This comes as no surprise given that Solana has performed better on the weekly chart compared to the daily chart with a 60.89% increase fo…]]></summary>

in finance have created as much talk and excitement as Bitcoin. This  
cryptocurrency has evolved from a tiny digital experiment to a global financial  
phenomenon since its launch in 2009. However, many people are wondering whether  
Bitcoin will ever overtake fiat currencies or if crypto itself will be

Bitcoin's  
Perception as a Store of Value
The perception  
of Bitcoin as a store of value is one of the most important elements driving  
its adoption. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, which are susceptible to  
inflation as a result of central bank policy, Bitcoin has a fixed supply limit  
of 21 million coins. This scarcity is intended to maintain Bitcoin's value and  
shield it from the devaluation that can occur with fiat currencies. Indiv…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rallied to its highest level since May 2022, as bullish sentiment exploded throughout the market. The surge came as traders believed a United States SEC announcement was imminent, over a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), likely from Blackrock. Ethereum also rose, climbing above $1,800.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin bulls pushed the cryptocurrency over the $35,000 level on Tuesday, as momentum over a potential ETF approval intensified.
 
Following a low of $30,433.32 to start the week, BTC/USD surged to a peak at $35,150.43 earlier in the day.
 
This resulted in bitcoin climbing to its highest level since May 7, 2022, when the price was trading above $36,000.
 
 
Earlier gains have somewhat eased due to several factors, one of which being the relative strength index (RSI) moving deep into overbought territory.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at the 88.60 mark, which is its strongest reading since the start of the year.
 
BTC is now trading at $34,528.51, as traders have likely started closing off positions, in order to secure profits.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) reached $1,800 for the first time in several months, after being the beneficiary of general sentiment around crypto.
 
ETH/USD rallied to an intraday high of $1,845.99 earlier in today’s session, a day after trading at a bottom at $1,664.58.
 
As a result of today’s peak, ethereum reached its highest point since August 13, when price was marginally below $1,860.
 
 
The move saw ethereum climb for a fifth straight session, which came as the RSI broke out of a resistance at 60.00.
 
Similar to bitcoin, price strength in ETH is now severely overbought, with the index now tracking at 76.79.
 
Bulls broke a ceiling of 68.00 over the last several hours, however it is unlikely that this will be sustained, as profit takers begin to loom.

How Seeding Suggests An Approval Is Imminent
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas mentioned that BlackRock’s amendment about seeding is noteworthy because it wasn’t in the original filing. However, he doesn’t want to read so much meaning into it. 
 
 
As to what seeding means and how it is a positive sign for the crypto community, Balchunas explained that seeding an ETF is when “initial funding” is provided to purchase a “few creation units,” which in this case would m…]]></summary>
