From 2011 to 2021, it was the world's best-performing asset class in eight of the last eleven years. At the end of 2023, it reemerged as the world's top-performing asset class.
It is also a trillion-dollar asset. BTC's market capitalization is at $1.13 trillion as of this writing. This value is outside the overall crypto market cap and excludes all other crypto coins. From a fledgling currency in 2008, its value has risen from nearly zero to over $73,000, reaching a historical all-time high in 2024.

One such opportunity that has caught their attention is the Mpeppe (MPEPE) casino presale. Here are three compelling reasons why FLOKI investors are flocking to the Mpeppe (MPEPE) presale.

His reassessment follows closely on the heels of the ruling in the SEC’s case against Kraken, where US District Judge William H. Orrick III made a decision that might have significant implications for the SEC’s ongoing enforcement actions against the crypto industry.
 
In that case, Judge Orrick sided with the SEC, reinforcing the application of the Howey test — the cornerstone of US securities law that determines whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract — to digital assets. Morgan highlighted that Judge Orrick, in his ruling, explicitly supported the approach taken by Judge Analisa Torres in the Ripple case and Judge Amy Berman Jackson in the SEC’s case against Binance.…]]></summary>
