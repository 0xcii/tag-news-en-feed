 This uptick is largely influenced by speculative hopes around exchange-traded funds (ETFs) potentially unlocking new demand avenues for Bitcoin, the largest crypto asset.
 
Despite the slight decline today, BTC remained resilient, positioned for an 18% weekly gain – the highest since March. This comes amid relative calm in smaller altcoins such as XRP, Cardano, and Solana. This upward trend in Bitcoin’s value is largely driven by whispers of new avenues for mainstream institutional involvement.
