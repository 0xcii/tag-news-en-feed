In the clip, Miles Franklin CEO Andy Schetman makes a case for XRP and how it can allow everyone to become “incredibly wealthy.” He noted how XRP’s price allows anyone to throw in a “modest amount of money” and still make good returns.  
 
Schetman also spoke about De-dollarization and warned about the need to embrace or get “rolled by the changes.” …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wall Street is on a Bitcoin buying spree, acquiring the digital asset at a staggering rate 12.5 times greater than its daily production, according to industry expert Anthony Pompliano. This relentless accumulation hints at big money’s growing conviction in the cypto’s future, fueled by the approaching “halving” event and the recent green light for ETFs.
 
 
Imagine printing money, then cutting production in half. That’s essentially what happens with Bitcoin’s halving, scheduled for April 2024. Every four years, the reward for mining new Bitcoins gets slashed, gradually reducing the total supply to a predetermined 21 million. This built-in scarcity is a major draw for institutions, who anticipate a price surge as demand outpaces supply.
