Filed yesterday (Thursday), the lawsuit termed the efforts of the regulator a “campaign to seize control over the future of cryptocurrency.”
A Strategic Lawsuit
The lawsuit argued that if the SEC continues to exert its authority over Ethereum, it would bring the blockchain to a halt, “crippling one of the internet’s greatest innovations.”
Consensys revealed that its actions against the SEC followed its receipt of a Wells Notice on April 10, indicating that the regulator is preparing to bring enforcement actions against the company over the services of its MetaMask wallet. The company highli…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Pattern Could Suggest Bull Market Isn’t Over Yet
 
In a new post on X, IntoTheBlock discussed a pattern that the total holdings of Bitcoin long-term holders have generally followed during bull markets in the past.
 
The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to investors who have been holding their coins for longer than a year (as defined by IntoTheBlock; other analytics firms use a different cutoff) without having sold or moved them on the blockchain.
 
 
Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell at any point. As such, the LTHs, who hold for significant periods, are …]]></summary>

Is Bitcoin Inside A Wyckoff Re-accumulation Phase?
 
Taking to X, the analyst believes Bitcoin might be forming a Wyckoff Re-accumulation pattern on the daily chart. This means the coin could consolidate in a trading range before catapulting higher in the days ahead.
 
 
Technically, the Wyckoff Re-accumulation pattern identifies a phase when it is assumed that big players, primarily whales, are quietly buying at a discount. Price action remains muted and inside a defined range whenever they do this.

Turning Point For BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF? 
 
IBIT had emerged as a frontrunner in the race among Bitcoin ETFs, securing the top spot in inflows and trading volume. However, this recent halt in inflows signals a potential turning point for the fund, albeit falling just short of claiming the record for consecutive inflow days.
