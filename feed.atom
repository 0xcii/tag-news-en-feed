        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu bears ended a three-day bull run on Thursday, as a red wave swept over cryptocurrency markets. Today’s drop comes as the global crypto market cap fell by as much as 1.50%. Toncoin also slipped, as profit takers moved to secure recent gains.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) moved lower during today’s session, as bears ended a three-day winning streak.
 
After peaking at $0.000007527 on Wednesday, SHIB/USD slipped to a bottom of $0.00000725 earlier in the day.
 
The decline came as bulls were unable to move beyond a ceiling at $0.00000755, giving way to downward pressure in the process.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the shift in momentum came after the relative strength index (RSI) failed to break a key ceiling.
 
The index was unable to penetrate a resistance level of 43.00, and is now tracking at a reading of 40.09.
 
Should price continue to fall in coming days, the landing spot could likely be a point of support at $0.00000710.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) fell by as much as 7% on Thursday, after recently climbing to its highest point in nine months.
 
TON/USD dropped to a low of $2.31 earlier in the day, after peaking at $2.49 less than 24 hours ago.
 
The drop came as toncoin bulls seemingly opted to secure gains, following a recent surge to its strongest point since late-January.
 
 
After tracking deep in the overbought region in the past few days, toncoin’s RSI is now sitting at 65.19.
 
It appears that the next support point for price strength could be at 56.00, which may mean more profit taking could be on the cards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below the $27,000 level on Thursday, as markets reacted to the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision. As expected, the Fed opted to keep rates unchanged at 5.5%, whilst hinting at one additional raise in the current cycle. The dollar strengthened across the board following the decision. Ethereum is on the cusp of a drop under $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin fell for a second consecutive day, in the aftermath of the U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision.
 
Following a high of $27,289.77 on Wednesday, BTC/USD dropped to a low of $26,703.77 earlier in today’s session.
 
The Fed’s decision to pause has led to dollar strength, with USD hitting its strongest level since April versus the British pound.
 
 
As a result of the BTC drop, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell below a support point at the 55.00 level.
 
Price strength now stands at a reading of 52.45, and appears to be heading for a lower floor near the 45.00 region.
 
Should the index fall to this floor, there is a good chance that bitcoin could be hovering near $26,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) neared a drop below a key price level in today’s session, hitting a one-week low in the process.
 
ETH/USD slipped to an intraday low of $1,606.18 earlier in the day, following Wednesday’s peak at $1,639.35.
 
Thursday’s decline pushed ethereum to its weakest point since September 13, which is the last time price was below $1,600.
 
 
Since failing to break out of a ceiling at 49.00, the RSI has moved closer into oversold territory, and now tracks at 41.52.
 
Bears seem to be looking to land at a point of support at 35.00, which could lead ETH to hitting the $1,575 floor.
 
Bulls are possibly still waiting in the wings, as the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages have still not crossed.
