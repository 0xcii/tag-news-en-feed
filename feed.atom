        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gary Gensler, the controversial US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, recently sounded the alarm on the uncharted territory of crypto markets.

This request, if Congress approves, would elevate the SEC’s enforcement budget to an impressive $1.4 billion, signaling a relentless commitment to curbing potential abuses and safeguarding the public from the complexities of the crypto realm.
 
His call for increased funding is not a mere bureaucratic gesture but a plea for the necessary resources to bring order and clarity to an otherwise chaotic landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Turkish court has sentenced Faruk Fatih Özer, the founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange Thodex, to an effective seven months and 15 days in prison. During the trial, Özer denied being an executive of the crypto exchange when the platform allegedly failed to furnish the Tax Inspection Board with the documents requested. 
 
Appointment of Trustee Reportedly Made Submission of Requested Documents Impossible
 
A court in Turkey has sentenced Faruk Fatih Özer, the founder of the defunct cryptocurrency exchange Thodex, to just over seven months in prison for failing to furnish the Tax Inspection Board with the documents it requested. However, according to a report in the Hurriyet Daily News, the Anatolian 17th Criminal Court of First Instance has since agreed to delay announcing the verdict as well as the implementation of the sentence.
 
As explained in the report, Özer, who was arrested in Albania in Aug. 2022, claimed that he was not a company executive when the alleged crime was committed. He also argued that the appointment of a trustee had made it impossible for him to submit the requested documents. Özer’s pleas nevertheless failed to sway prosecutors who were reportedly seeking a five-year jail sentence.
 

 
According to the report, the court initially ruled that the founder of Thodex should spend one year and six months behind bars. However, after considering the founder’s reported behavior before and during the trial, the Turkish court eventually ruled that Özer should only be in jail for seven months and 15 days.
 
Meanwhile, in addition to failing to submit tax documents, Özer is also accused of defrauding investors via his crypto platform. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, the Thodex founder was arrested in Albania several months after he fled from Turkey with $2 billion which belonged to investors.

Cipolaro examines the opportunity it presents, its implications for the investment community, and the potential demand it could unleash. The analysis also sheds light on the existing landscape of BTC funds, the comparisons to gold, and the potential scenarios that could unfold if a spot Bitcoin ETF were to materialize.
 
Before examining the potential impact of a spot ETF, it is crucial to grasp the current state of Bitcoin investments. While the US has not yet witnessed a spot ETF, existing structures, including trusts like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), futures-based ETFs, spot-based ETFs outside the US, and private fund…]]></summary>

According to France’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers, the license allows Forge to offer services which include crypto custody, trading, and sales.
 
License Said to Enable Forge to Meet Institutional Demand for Digital Assets
 
Forge, the crypto division of France’s banking giant Societe Generale, recently received what is being described as the first crypto services license issued under the country’s crypto assets laws, a report has said. French market regulator Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) stated on its website that the license allows Forge to offer services which include crypto custody, trading, and sales.
 
According to a Reuters report, the license given to Forge does not subject the Societe Generale’s subsidiary to the same onerous rules faced by other crypto entities, particularly in the areas of corporate governance, information technology, and compliance.
 

 
Jean-Marc Stenger, the CEO of Forge, said the license enables his company to meet demand from institutional clients for digital assets.
 
“This step will allow us to continue supporting our institutional clients wishing to benefit from services on digital assets that meet the highest standards of compliance and banking security,” Stenger said.
