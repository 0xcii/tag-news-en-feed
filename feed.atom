        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid the company’s several troubles, Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges has now found itself in hot water in France over allegations of severe lapses in its money laundering protocols and the unauthorized provision of digital asset services to French customers.  According to CoinDesk, the Paris public prosecutor has confirmed this development, escalating the legal troubles for the crypto giant.
 
These allegations against Binance stem from two main charges. First, the company is accused of operating as a digital asset service provider unlawfully. Second, it faces more severe accusations of ‘aggravated money laundering.’ 
 
This includes competition with investments, concealment, and conversion, with the latter performed by offenders who have generated profits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance, the crypto exchange with the highest trade volume globally, is currently facing an investigation for suspected money laundering activities, as reported by the French publication Le Monde. The finance judicial investigation service of France is currently scrutinizing the actions of Binance’s subsidiary in the country.
 
French Regulators Probe Binance
 
Amid mounting challenges faced by the crypto exchange Binance, recent developments reveal that French authorities have turned their attention to the exchange’s French subsidiary. Following the legal action taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance, reports indicate that law enforcement officials in France have initiated an investigation into the matter. The French publication Le Monde has verified this information with the Paris public prosecutor’s office.
 
The complaint against Binance contains accusations of “aggravated money laundering” and charges related to the “illegal provision of services for digital assets (PSAN).” It is alleged that Binance neglected to establish a proper know-your-customer (KYC) compliance process within the country. However, a spokesperson from Binance, in correspondence with Reuters, disclosed that the exchange engaged in a meeting with regulators just last week.
 
 
“In France, on-site visits by regulators and inspectors are part of regulatory obligations to which all financial institutions must adhere. We had an on-site visit last week by the relevant authorities,” the Binance representative said. “We will not comment on the specifics of law enforcement or regulatory investigations except to say that information about our users is held securely and only provided to government officials upon receipt of documented appropriate justification.”

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-eth-rebound-on-friday-as-markets-digest-us-retail-sales-data/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-16T12:38:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose back above $25,000 on Friday, as markets continued to digest recent U.S. economic data. Yesterday saw retail sales climb higher than expected, rising by 0.3% in May, better than a projected decline of 0.1%. Ethereum moved closer to the $1,700 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin bulls made a brief appearance during Friday’s session, pushing the price back above $25,000 in the process.
 
Following a low of $24,797.17 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $25,735.31 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed above a recent ceiling at the $25,500 mark.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 

 
Despite today’s $1,000 jump in price, the relative strength index (RSI) still remains below a resistance of its own at 42.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.00, which could act as a major hurdle to further upwards momentum.
 
It will be interesting to see how traders behave over the coming weekend, with the chance to buy this week’s dip still present.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) made relative gains in today’s session, as the cryptocurrency moved back towards the $1,700 level.
 
ETH/USD reached a high of $1,676.41 on Friday, less than 24 hours after nearing a breakout below $1,600.
 
The rebound in ethereum comes as the RSI moved away from a recent three-month low of 30.74, which was in oversold territory.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Similar to BTC above, price strength has since climbed, and is currently at a reading of 33.39, which is still bearish.
 
Traders will likely look to March, which is the last time the index tracked at this mark, shortly before prices went on to climb over $500 higher.

In 1714, the British Parliament introduced the Longitude Act, a law rewarding a £20,000 bounty (more than $1 million in today’s money) to anyone who could accurately determine longitude at sea. Captains had been struggling with poor navigation since the onset of global trade. Though sailors could easily measure latitude by gauging the sun’s height, longitude was very hard to determine and inapt techniques veered vessels of course. Without visual bearings, humans were sailing blind on the open seas. The increased travel time led to scurvy, delays and ships smashing on the rocks — losing crew and cargo forever to the deep.

In recent months, Bitcoin has demonstrated a remarkable decoupling from gold, further solidifying its position as a distinct and independent investment instrument.
 
 
While the precious metal has long been regarded as a reliable store of value during times of economic turmoil, the emergence of Bitcoin has disrupted this narrative. The digital asset’s superior growth since the US banking crisis has captured the attention of investors worldwide, luring them toward the possibilities offered by this digital asset.
