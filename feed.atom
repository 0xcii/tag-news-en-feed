        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While yesterday’s Biden-McCarthy meeting did not result in an agreement on the debt ceiling in the U.S., this could have direct implications for the entire financial market and Bitcoin. And the implications for the Federal Reserve’s efforts to fight inflation are nothing short of massive.
 
When the question of how the Fed would handle a failure to raise the debt ceiling came up during the FOMC press conference yesterday, Chair Jerome Powell was noticeably annoyed.
 
“There’s only one way forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States government can pay all its obligations,” Powell said yesterday, further stating: “No one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner.”

Previously, the bank offered such loans as a way for clients to fund their mining operations. But now it cited changing market conditions and increased regulatory inspection as reasons to halt these services.
 
Reasons for The Bank’s Decision
 
Crypto mining requires specialized equipment and a significant amount of electricity. These mining equipment are expensive, ranging from $2,000-$20,000, and usually serve as collateral for miners’ loans.
 
However, during the market downturn in 2022, many miners halted operations due to falling BTC prices and rising electricity costs. 
 
As a result, many vendors slashed the price of mining rigs due to falling demand. Unfortun…]]></summary>
