The Runes Protocol, developed by the mind behind the Ordinal Theory, Casey Rodarmor, is generating buzz as it introduces a new fungible token standard for Bitcoin. 
 
A recent report by crypto analysis firm Delphi Digital sheds light on the potential of Runes to disrupt the tokenization landscape, challenging the dominance of BRC-20s. 
 
A Glimpse Into The Runes Protocol
