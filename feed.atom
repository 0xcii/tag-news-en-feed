        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is weak at spot rates, contracting from July 2024 peaks to below $66,000. As bears press on, targeting the round number at $60,000, bulls are optimistic, expecting a rebound in the coming sessions.
 
Technically, the zone between $66,000 and $70,000 is a crucial zone that buyers must decisively break for the uptrend to develop. Any lift-off above $72,000 would be ideal, as it is the last resistance before an all-time high of around $74,000.
 
Bitcoin Struggling: Will Bulls Absorb Rising Inflows To Exchanges?
 
Though Bitcoin might find strength, one analyst thinks the coin will continue posting lower lows, confirming losses for the better part of this week. In a post citing CryptoQuant data, the analyst picked out how age bands have evolved over the past years and months.

At its core, the Act proposes the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) and a structured Bitcoin Purchase Program, and comprehensive national custody policy. While the bill is quite brief, what follows is a breakdown of the Act's key provisions, their implications, and the innovative funding mechanisms employed.

However, even though bitcoin has set a new all-time high and had two years of a near-constant positive trajectory, we're yet to see a consistent influx of retail investors. The potential for a surge in retail participation and the possibility of elevating the bitcoin price to unprecedented levels are prospects that many investors are anxiously anticipating. In this article, we're going to explore when we might see these retail investors dive back into the bitcoin pool and whether their return could indeed propel BTC to even greater heights.

We distinguish between "n-of-n" multi-signatures, where the number of involved parties is n, and they all need to approve, and "t-of-n" threshold signatures, where only a smaller number t of participants need to approve. Cryptographic schemes like MuSig, MuSig-DN and MuSig2 for multi-signatures and FROST by Komlo and Goldberg for threshold signatures can reduce transaction cost and improve privacy of multisig wallets.
So far, in the Bitcoin Community FROST has only been used in experimental implementations. In this post, we explain why this is the case and how we aim to advance FROST in a Bitcoin production environment through our recent publication …]]></summary>

Starting Wednesday, the firm’s 15,000 advisors can pitch BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund to eligible clients.

BREAKING: Morgan Stanley tells wealth advisors they can pitch #Bitcoin ETFs, CNBC reports. pic.twitter.com/2tgSeR2yEm
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 2, 2024
  
  
  
Morgan Stanley's move is in response to high client demand for Bitcoin. However, the bank is still maintaining a cautious approach to Bitcoin: only clients with a net worth of at least $1.5 million, a high-risk tolerance, and an interest in speculative investments are eligible for bitcoin ETF solicitation, sources told CNBC. These investments are limited to taxable brokerage accounts, not retirement accounts. The bank will monitor clients' Bitcoin holdings to prevent excessive exposure to this volatile asset class.
Other major banks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, continue to restrict their advisors from pitching bitcoin ETFs unless clients explicitly request them, the report stated.
This decision marks a significant step towards institutional adoption of bitcoin in traditional finance. Morgan Stanley's offering of these ETFs reflects the growing integration of Bitcoin into mainstream finance and sets a precedent for other wealth management firms to follow.]]></summary>
