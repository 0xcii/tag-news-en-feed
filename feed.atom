        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Cyberspace to Outer Space
Tension is building in the mines. As the 4th Halving nears and the block reward trims to 3.125 bitcoin per block, miners must not only adapt to a significantly diminished reward, but contend with an increasingly profit-hostile future which might have surprised even the prescient Nakamoto. Indeed, despite widespread hope that fiat states will come to accept peaceful coexistence with bitcoin—I, too, would prefer this outcome—and despite some modest grounds for optimism, history would remind us that kings and emperors do not willingly relinquish power.

In January 2023, GBTC traded at a significant 48.31% discount to its net asset value (NAV).

End of 2023 Sees GBTC’s Discount to NAV Tighten
 
The largest bitcoin (BTC) trust known as GBTC has seen a significant improvement in terms of its previous discount to NAV. Essentially, net asset value (NAV) serves as a financial barometer, indicating the per-share value of a fund’s underlying assets. In the context of GBTC, the NAV represents the value of BTC it holds, adjusted for liabilities, and divided by its outstanding shares. Simply put, it’s a measure of what e…]]></summary>

stablecoins has been nothing short of revolutionary. These digital currencies,

own set of complexity and risks.
Stablecoins, in  
essence, provide a unique combination of stability and efficiency. Stablecoins,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was a notable mover on Friday, as the meme coin rebounded from a key support point. The move came after two consecutive days of declines, pushing price near a two-month low. Solana also ended a losing streak in today’s session. 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) rose higher in today’s session, after the meme coin snapped a recent losing streak.
 
DOGE/USD climbed to a peak of $0.05873 earlier in the day, after falling to a low at $0.05747 the day prior.
 
The move comes after dogecoin dropped close to a floor at $0.0580, with bulls choosing to reject this breakout.
 
 
Since hitting this support level, it now seems that the next target could be at resistance of $0.0595.
 
On closer inspection of the chart, it appears that the relative strength index (RSI) also rebounded from a floor of its own at 31.00.
 
The index is now at a reading of 33.20, with the next level traders might target at 35.00, which seems to be an interim ceiling.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) also climbed higher on Friday, after falling to a two-week low during Thursday’s session.
 
Following a drop to a low of $21.07 yesterday, SOL/USD rallied to an intraday peak at $21.59 earlier today.
 
Similar to dogecoin, bulls bought the dip, after the token neared a support level of its own at the $21.00 mark.
 
 
Earlier gains have somewhat eased, which comes as price strength hovers around a floor of 50.00.
 
Should this level hold firm, there is a good chance that traders look to take solana back above $22.00 this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin ended a five-day losing streak on Friday, as the cryptocurrency appears to have found an interim price floor. This comes as traders continued to react to yesterday’s U.S. inflation report, which remained unchanged at 3.7%. Ethereum also edged marginally higher, following its own recent bear run. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) snapped a five-day winless run on Friday, as markets continued to react to the latest inflation report in the United States.
 
Following a low of $26,558.32 during Thursday’s session, BTC/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $26,919.04 earlier today.
 
Overall, today’s rebound in price came after BTC collided with the $26,560 level, with bulls using this as a floor, for now.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
It appears that the longer-term point of support is at $26,000, however with the relative strength index (RSI) failing to move below the 45.00 level, price has yet to hit this zone.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 46.41, since failing to breach its floor at 45.00, however bears could attempt to send this lower in the coming days.
 
Should this level hold, there is a possibility that bitcoin reenters the $27,000 level this weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was marginally higher today, after it too rebounded from its own support level on Friday.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,553.51 during today’s session, which follows a bottom at the $1,523.24 mark the day prior.
 
Yesterday’s low was the weakest point that ethereum had hit since March 12, when price bottomed out at $1,612.

The 10-day (red) moving average has continued to extend its downward crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart, suggesting upcoming bearish sentiment.
 
Although the price is now above the floor at $1,535, there is a good chance that this could change in the coming days.
