How DOGE’s Price Could “Bleed Down”
 
CrediBULL Crypto mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that there are two ways that Dogecoin’s price could reject and bleed down. The first way he claimed is if Bitcoin rejects and bleeds down. He expects that a potential downward trend by the flagship crypto will also cause Dogecoin to suffer a similar fate and experience a price dropdown. 
 
 
Meanwhile, the second way in which CrediBULL Crypto claimed that Dogecoin’s price could decline is if Bitcoin makes a parabolic move so “big and strong” that it captures everyone’s attention and liqui…]]></summary>

Even reaching the top of this channel would translate to a market cap of nearly $290 billion, a significant jump from its current position.

Kabosu became an internet icon as the face of

Most recently, manifestations of this phenomenon have begun populating your local Bitcoin memepools because of ordinals trading. Without going into too much detail, the way on-chain trading currently works is through the use of pre-signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBTs).
