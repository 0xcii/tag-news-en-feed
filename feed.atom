        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin supply is gradually shifting concentration from America to Asia and the increasing regulatory pressure on the crypto industry from United States regulators might be sparking the change. 
 
Crypto regulation in the US is becoming stricter, prompting some firms to consider relocation. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong even hinted at a possible relocation during a Fintech conference in London.
 
But these relocation plans may have crossed over to crypto assets holdings as Bitcoin supply in the US region is now declining. 
 
American Bitcoin Supply Drops Drastically
 
A blockchain analytics firm, Glassnode, reported that the year-over-year Bitcoin supply for America had dropped drastically with the formation of a divergence. Conversely, the asset supply spiked higher for the Asian region.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-tron-nears-crypto-top-10-as-matic-extends-declines/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-10T15:43:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tron moved closer to being in the cryptocurrency top 10 on Wednesday, as the token rose for a second straight day. Prices climbed by nearly 2% in today’s session, despite the global market cap moving marginally lower. Polygon, which currently occupies the tenth position, fell to a five-month low. 
 
TRON (TRX)
 
TRON (TRX), rose by as much as 2% on Wednesday, as the token moved closer to entering the cryptocurrency top 10.
 
Following a low of $0.06841 on Tuesday, TRX/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $0.07031 earlier in the session.
 
As a result of this jump, TRX is now marginally above a long-term resistance level of $0.070.
 
 
It appears that the target for bulls could be to not only break this ceiling, but move to $0.072, which would see the token hit a three-month high.
 
One of the main obstacles preventing this is the relative strength index (RSI), which is currently tracking at 59.67, below resistance at 60.00.
 
If and when price strength moves beyond this point, there will likely be more bulls reentering the market.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) which is currently the world’s tenth largest cryptocurrency, fell for a fifth straight day.
 
MATIC/USD plunged to a bottom at $0.866, less than a day after the token was trading near $0.90.
 
This latest decline in price has pushed polygon to its lowest point since January 11, when it traded at $0.84.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this spell of sell-offs has sent the RSI below 30.00, which is deep in oversold territory.
 
The last time price strength tracked this low was back in July 2022, which may give bulls optimism that a reversal could be soon approaching.
 
MATIC is now trading at $0.8723, which is marginally higher than its earlier lows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On May 9, digital currency fund manager Grayscale Investments announced the establishment of the Grayscale Funds Trust and submitted registration filings for three exchange-traded funds with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Grayscale Introduces Grayscale Funds Trust and Files for 3 ETFs
 
As the leading digital currency fund manager, in terms of assets under management (AUM), Grayscale Investments unveiled the Grayscale Funds Trust launch. The trust is a Delaware statutory trust structure designed to strengthen the company’s worldwide asset management capabilities. “A registration statement relating to Grayscale Funds Trust has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective,” Grayscale stated on Tuesday.
 
Grayscale highlighted that they had previously established Grayscale Advisors, an SEC-registered investment advisor, which will serve as the new trust’s advisor. Besides the trust, Grayscale has also filed a registration statement for three additional funds. These newly launched funds consist of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, and Grayscale Privacy ETF.
 
Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in a statement: “The creation of Grayscale Funds Trust reflects our dedication to scaling Grayscale’s business responsibly,” adding that “we are putting the necessary foundations in place so Grayscale can continue creating and managing regulated, future-forward products.”
 
 
Moreover, Grayscale announced that David LaValle, the company’s global head of ETFs, would assist with their expansion. “It has been incredibly exciting to build our ETF franchise – hiring a dedicated team, expanding our partnerships, and enhancing our position within the ETF ecosystem,” LaValle said.

The lead singer said it was timed to give fans a chance to get comfortable with Web3 technology ahead of the group's 2023 tour, when the NFT holders can use their Deathbats for early access to tickets. M. Shadows also talked to hosts Andrew Hayward and Stephen Graves about AI and bringing Web3 into gaming.]]></summary>
