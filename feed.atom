        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain data on April 5 shows that the Cardano Treasury is rapidly growing even as ADA prices struggle to shake off determined sellers. Currently, the treasury holds over 1.48 billion ADA worth over $843 million at spot rates. 
 
If adoption projections are anything to go by, the figure could exponentially increase in the coming months, possibly propping up ADA prices.  
 
Cardano Treasury Rising: Bullish For Development
 
The Cardano Treasury exists by design. It serves as a war chest to fund ongoing development. 
 
 
A fixed amount of ADA is set aside per epoch—that is when a block of transactions is confirmed—and sent to the treasury. Every epoch is completed roughly after five days.
 
Besides ADA accumulation from reserves, the treasury reserves a portion of funds from transaction fee…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
As we approach the conclusion of the third epoch, the countdown to the next Bitcoin halving is firmly underway. The halving (also known as the “Halvening”) is one of the most important and innovative features of Bitcoin. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network issues new bitcoin and approximately every four years (every 210,000 blocks, to be precise) the amount issued (the “block subsidy”) is cut in half. The block subsidy is the reward miners receive for validating and recording new transactions on the blockchain.
The halving of the block subsidy is a critical factor in bitcoin’s eventual capped supply of 21 million bitcoin. In addition, miners also collect transaction fees that users attach to their transactions to encourage miners to include them in the next block. Therefore …]]></summary>

This has seen DOGE falling across a number of metrics, including the MVRV ratio. The MVRV ratio recently turned negative, a condition that indicates many holders are currently at a loss. This might sound bad, but it could actually be a massive buy opportunity for long-term investors of the meme cryptocurrency. 
 
Dogecoin MVRV Ratio Turns Negative: Why Does This Matter?
 
Data has shown DOGE falling to the negative side of its MVRV ratio. According to price data provided by Santiment, an on-chain analytics company, DOGE’s MVRV ratio fell quickly to a low of 15.36% on April 4.
