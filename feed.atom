Out of 1,318 blockchain-based games launched since 2021, a staggering 407, over 30%, have already been discontinued or abandoned.
 
This stark statistic, compiled by BlockchainGamer.biz, paints a picture of an industry grappling with fundamental challenges. Smaller, underfunded projects appear particularly vulnerable, often vanishing silently without any official announcement.
 
 
Are Blockchain Games Going Extinct? The Main Culprit
 
Funding constraints and evolving market conditions are cited as the primary culprits, suggesting that building a successful blockchain game requires much more than just buzzwords and tokenomics.

Famous inventor and engineer, Nikola Tesla, thought that this connection is all about energy, how often things vibrate, and the way they move. I believe that as well; our perceptions of every aspect of life can be perceived as a transfer of energy, a simple equation. Let's take a moment to view the seemingly random interactions in the world as their own version of an energy transaction. The following analogies are different ways to help us think about energy, especially how we use it and share it while also respecting nature's wisdom.

"I believe it goes up if the world is frightened, if the people have fearful geopolitical risks, they're fearful of their own risks," said Fink. "It's no different than what gold represented over thousands of years. It is an asset class that protects you."
Fink's recognition of Bitcoin as a protective asset suggests helps shift the narrative surrounding the digital currency, emphasizing its role as a safeguard amid economic uncertainties. This endorsement from the head of the world's largest asset management firm is a significant milestone for Bitcoin's acceptance within mainstream financial circles.
"Unlike gold where we manufacture new gold, we're almost at the ceiling of the amount of Bitcoin that can be created," Fink continued. "What we're trying to do is offer an instrument that can store wealth."
The statement comes just two days after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved BlackRock's, alongside 10 other asset managers, spot Bitcoin ETF. Fink's positive sentiment further adds to the growing chorus of influential figures recognizing Bitcoin's potential to play a protective role in an investment portfolio.
As the Bitcoin market continues to evolve, statements like these from key industry figures contribute to shaping a positive narrative around Bitcoin, potentially influencing broader market sentiments and paving the way for increased adoption.]]></summary>
