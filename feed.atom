Network, a blockchain protocol aiming to tackle scalability challenges, has

This controversy has not only shaken investor confidence in cryptocurrencies but has also cast a pall over the city’s ambitions in the digital asset arena.

However, its recent implosion is expected to make the public more cautious about investing in cryptocurrencies, according to experts cited by the South China Morning Post.

Malek believes a looming energy supercycle could be the driving force pushing crude prices upward. Another significant factor, Malek points out, is the “institutional and policy-led pressures” hastening the shift from hydrocarbons.
 
JPMorgan’s EMEA Energy Equity Strategist Flags ‘Supercycle’
 
After the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) decision to cut oil production, Brent and WTI crude prices have surged past the $90 per barrel mark. The year 2023 has been eventful with the unmistakable stamp of de-dollarization, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and energy collaborations among BRICS countries.

According to Woo, this surge in BTC derivatives trading is gradually siphoning liquidity away from the actual coins. He emphasized the ratio between the combined futures open value of derivatives and the highly liquid real crypto that is actively traded.

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/cypherpunk-legend-adam-back-bitcoin-is-digital-gold-for-the-next-millennia"/>
        <updated>2023-09-25T18:35:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adam Back, renowned cypherpunk and creator of Hashcash, made a bold statement on X this weekend, arguing that Bitcoin is poised to replace gold as the ultimate store of value for the next millennium. 
Back's remarks reflect his deep-rooted belief in the transformative potential of Bitcoin and its ability to outshine traditional assets like gold.
In his X post, Back said:



These words carry significant weight in the crypto community, as Adam Back is no stranger to the world of digital currencies. He has played a pivotal role in the development of cryptographic technologies and is widely recognized as a cypherpunk luminary. 
More specifically, his creation, Hashcash, laid the groundwork for the concept of proof-of-work, which Bitcoin's founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, later incorporated into the cryptocurrency's underlying technology.
Adam Back's advocacy for Bitcoin as the "digital gold" of the future aligns with the broader narrative that has been gaining momentum in recent years. Bitcoin has increasingly been viewed as a superior store of value compared to traditional assets like gold due to its scarcity, divisibility, and resistance to censorship.
As central banks continue to engage in unprecedented levels of monetary expansion, Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty has grown significantly. Investors, institutions, and individuals alike are turning to Bitcoin as a way to safeguard their wealth in an increasingly uncertain financial landscape.
Back's perspective on Bitcoin's long-term potential also resonates with his history in the cypherpunk movement, where individuals have championed the idea of digital privacy, censorship resistance, and financial sovereignty. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and cryptographic security, embodies many of the principles that cypherpunks have long advocated for.
While the debate over whether Bitcoin can truly replace gold as the ultimate store of value rages on, Adam Back's endorsement carries substantial weight.]]></summary>
