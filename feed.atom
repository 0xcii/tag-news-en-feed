Coinbase is the poster child for the American crypto industry and has always been committed to regulatory compliance and license registration – otherwise, the exchange wouldn’t have been able to get its IPO approved either.

The note includes an encrypted message with the sender asking the Euler’s exploiter to decrypt the message with the private keys. Experts believe it is an attempt to trap the Euler’s hacker in a phishing scheme to drain stolen funds from its wallet by stealing the login credentials. 
 
It was not the first time both hackers interacted with each other. On March 17, Euler’s exploiter sent 100 Ethereum to the Ronin attacker.
