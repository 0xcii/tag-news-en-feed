The announcement yesterday (Wednesday) by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) detailed that, along with the 25-year-old Pleterski, the authorities also charged his associate, 27-year-old Colin Murphy, with fraud. The arrest and the charges came after a 16-month-long joint investigation by the OSC and the Durham Regional Police Service (DRPS).
