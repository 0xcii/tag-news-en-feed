A report compiled by DappRadar showed that Blur’s NFT loan volumes rose from 4,200 ETH (or roughly $7.6 million) to 169,900 ETH (or $308 million) in less than a month. All loans were processed through the Blur Lending protocol called Blend that was launched on May 1, 2023.
 
Further data reveals that NFT trading volumes have been shrinking as activity shifts to lending since early May. Trackers show that more NFT holders are creating accounts and taking loans backed with their assets.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently made a bold statement, stating that he expects a decision from the court “in weeks, not months.”
 
However, another prominent figure, pro-XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan, has predicted the case’s outcome. Hogan claims that the judge in the Ripple case has been making major rulings about every 9 weeks, with the final major ruling on summary judgment expected in mid-July. 
 
Hogan clarified that this is not a prediction but rather a pattern that has emerged in the case, , it does suggest that the case’s outcome may be decided in the coming weeks.

As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a large negative spike in the netflow took place just yesterday. The “exchange netflow” is an indicator that measures the net amount of Bitcoin that’s entering into or exiting the wallets of all centralized exchanges. Its value is naturally calculated as the inflows minus the outflows.
 
When the value of this metric is positive, it means a net amount of BTC is entering the wallets of these platforms right now. Since one of the main reasons why investors would deposit their coins to the exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin Core version 25.0 has been released, bringing new features, bug fixes and performance improvements to the software. Users can download the latest version from the official Bitcoin Core website or update their existing installations. The release notes outline the changes and provide instructions on how to upgrade.
One notable change is the allowance of transactions of non-witness size 65 bytes and above, which opens up new use cases and enhances protections against vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-12842. Another addition is the scanblocks RPC, which allows for fast wallet rescans by returning relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors.
In terms of RPC updates, all JSON-RPC methods now accept a new named parameter called "args" for passing positional parameter values conveniently. Additionally, the verifychain RPC will now return false if checks couldn't be completed at the desired depth and level, providing more accurate feedback.
The release also includes changes to the build system, updated settings and new features. For instance, the shutdownnotify option allows users to specify a command to execute before Bitcoin Core begins its shutdown sequence. In the wallet section, new options like minconf and maxconf have been added to various RPCs, providing greater control over UTXO confirmations.
Bitcoin Core 25.0 introduces several improvements and optimizations, enhancing the user experience and security of the software. As with any release, users are encouraged to report any bugs they encounter to the official GitHub issue tracker.
Bitcoin Core is widely supported and tested on major operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and Windows. However, it is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems. Users should ensure they are running a compatible operating system before upgrading to the latest version. In addition, users are encouraged to review the release notes for a detailed understanding of the improvements in this version if upgrading.]]></summary>
