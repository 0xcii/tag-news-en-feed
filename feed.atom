Bitcoin Whale Transaction Count Has Declined Recently
 
According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the transactions being done on the network by whales have slowed down recently. The relevant indicator here is the “whale transaction count,” which measures the total number of Bitcoin transfers taking place on the chain on any given day, that are valued at $1 million or more.
 
When the value of this indicator is high, it means there are a large number of massive movements happening in the market right now, suggesting that whales are actively trading. On the other hand, low values suggest these humongous holders aren’t making many moves at the moment.

In recent court filings by the U.S. Department of Justice against Avraham Eisenberg, the DoJ refers to two cryptocurrencies as commodities. Eisenberg, who exploited the decentralized finance platform Mango Markets and made $67 million, was arrested yesterday in Puerto Rico and charged with market manipulation.
