Observers of the market infer that Waller’s comments indicate a potential shift in the stance of the U.S. central bank, a notable deviation given his usually hawkish perspective. Concurrently, the Federal Reserve’s latest ‘Beige Book’ report presented a more troubling outlook than its predecessor, pointing to decelerated economic expansion and a rise in consumer credit defaults.

The incident unfolded last week when a Bitcoin transaction included a fee of 83.65 BTC, equivalent to roughly $3.1 million, to transfer 55.77 BTC worth around $2.1 million. This extraordinary fee, amounting to over 120,528 times the usual rate, was initially frozen by AntPool’s risk control system.
