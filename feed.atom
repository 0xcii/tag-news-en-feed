        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, has allegedly initiated a round of layoffs, according to sources who spoke with Chinese reporter Colin Wu, who runs the popular blockchain-focused Twitter account WuBlockchain.
 
Multiple sources have confirmed to WuBlockchain that the exchange has begun laying off employees, though the proportion of layoffs remains uncertain. With a reported total of around 8,000 employees, rumors suggest that the proportion of layoffs in June was approximately 20%.
 
Binance In Crisis?
 
According to Colin Wu, the compensation plan for affected employees will be formulated based on different situations in different locations. However, it is worth noting that some departments are still reportedly continuing to recruit.

Bitcoin 7-Day Mining Hashrate Has Continued To Rise Recently
 
The “mining hashrate” here refers to a measure of the total amount of computing power that the Bitcoin miners have currently connected to the network.
 
When this metric rises, it means the miners are bringing in more machines online on the network right now. Generally, this kind of trend is a sign that these chain validators are finding it profitable to mine on the network currently.
 
On the other hand, decreasing values imply some miners are leaving the chain at the moment. Such a trend can suggest the miners aren’t finding it that attractive to mine the cryptocurrency.
