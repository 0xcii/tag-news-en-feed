DOJ Fires Back At Roman Storm
 
On August 23, the DOJ announced an indictment against Storm and fellow Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Semenwov for their role in the “creation, operation, and promotion” of the popular crypto mixer platform. The US prosecutors charged both parties with conspiracies to commit money laundering, breach the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA), and operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business.

In a recent analysis titled “Does history make a case that Bitcoin has topped?”, Brandt throws cold water on the idea of a limitless price surge, suggesting the cryptocurrency might be nearing the summit of its current bull run.
 
 
Bitcoin And The Exponential Dampener
 
Brandt’s analysis hinges on the concept of “exponential decay.” He dissects Bitcoin’s history, identifying four distinct bull cycles, with the current one being the fifth. Here’s where things get interesting: Brandt observes a concerning trend – each successive cycle has exhibited a diminishing level of exponential growth. In simpler terms, the price gains haven’t been as explosive as in previous cycles.
