        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin and crypto exchange Coinbase has integrated Bitcoin's Lightning Network, enabling faster and cheaper BTC transactions for its users in the United States (with the exception of New York). 
As the largest Bitcoin exchange globally by users, trading volume, and custody of assets, Coinbase's adoption of Lightning is a major win for the Bitcoin scaling solution. Lightning allows near-instant Bitcoin payments with significantly lower fees by moving transactions off-chain.
Coinbase has been working to implement Lightning support for years to further its mission of building a payments network costing pennies per transaction. This integration finally unlocks the power of instant and affordable Bitcoin payments for the exchange's massive US user base.
By partnering with Lightning infrastructure provider Lightspark, co-founded by former PayPal executive David Marcus, Coinbase now gives users the option to withdraw or send Bitcoin via Lightning. 
Transactions process in seconds and cost a fraction of on-chain BTC payments.
Marcus celebrated the milestone, stating "We're so thrilled to be part of this journey with you to bring Lightning to 100s of millions of people in over 100 countries. Big milestone for the entire network and for Bitcoin."
The Bitcoin community has long awaited Lightning integration from Coinbase, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges. 
While the Lightning Network has seen impressive growth over recent years, Coinbase's integration marks the protocol's biggest leap towards broader adoption yet, expanding the network to millions of new users.
Coinbase's adoption signals faith in the network's maturity and highlights the promise of Layer 2 scaling for helping Bitcoin evolve into a global payment rail.]]></summary>

The almost perfect alignment between big government, big banks and corporations should be a serious cause for concern across the agricultural sector. These moves represent no less than the most serious threats to our freedom and survival as businesses, probably even as individuals. If you stand for resilience and biodiversity, bitcoin should be a natural fit. Bitcoin ultimately protects biodiversity. 
Concentration of power and money had started long before the COVID hysteria took over the world. Corporatization of the agricultural sector has been my main concern long before the legalization hype started.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On a Q1 earnings call yesterday, Alliance Resource Partners, a coal mining company worth $2.8 billion that trades under the ticker ARLP on the Nasdaq, reported that it’s mining bitcoin and currently holding 425 BTC on its balance sheet.

“In the second half of 2020, we started mining bitcoin as a pilot project to monetize already paid for yet underutilized electricity load at our River View mine,” said Cary Marshall, Senior Vice President and CFO of Alliance Resource Partners, on the call.
“Since then we have mined and now own bitcoin valued at approximately $30 million,” he added.
The $30 million figure comes from valuing each of the 425 BTC the company holds at approximately $70,500, the price at which bitcoin was trading toward the end of Q1 2024. After factoring in Alliance’s bitcoin mining expenses, the company saw a net profit of $7.3 million from Bitcoin mining in Q1.
The amount of Bitcoin Alliance holds ranks it 23rd on the list of companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheet. 
Joe Craft, President and CEO of Alliance, pointed out on the call that the company isn’t necessarily pivoting to a bitcoin-centric strategy but, instead, approaching its bitcoin mining operation with a high degree of practicality.
“We are selling what we need to cover our expenses, so our exposure is limited,” said Craft.
“We do have some extra capacity that we're renting out to other Bitcoin miners within the data center that we've effectively built for this Bitcoin mining to take advantage of the low energy costs we have,” he added.

Their study, which cites insights from Bitcoin analyst Alex Bergeron, points out that a single entity now controls the Coinbase outputs for approximately 47% of the network hashrate—a significant concentration that suggests a shift toward oligopolistic tendencies within the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.
 
Bergeron, who has previously addressed issues of centralization, highlights that this trend may be driven by mining pools altering their payout schemes to reduce variance. This adjustment makes such pools more attractive and competitively dominant. Bergeron’s observations are supported by data from @mononautical on Twitter, showing that prominent mining pools like AntPool, F2Pool, and Bina…]]></summary>
