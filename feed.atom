More Bitcoins Into The Purse
 
Microstrategy has been a long supporter of Bitcoin, with former CEO Michael Saylor referring to the cryptocurrency as the digital synthetic successor to gold. He has also been vocal about Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation, much like physical gold.
 
 
The firm started buying Bitcoin back in August 2020 worth over $250 million and hasn’t slowed down since. According to a Twitter post by Michael Saylor, this latest buy of 12,333 BTC was purchased at an average price of $28,136 per bitcoin between April 29, 2023, and June 27, 2023.

The firm has amended its 19b-4 application filing for spot Bitcoin ETF to include a surveillance sharing agreement with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and a crypto exchange, likely Coinbase, according to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. 
 
The new agreement puts ARK’s filing similar to BlackRock’s recent filing. It is more likely to be approved since they filed first in collaboration with the institutional investment firm 21Shares.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
In a blockchain network where participants remain anonymous, a dependable coordination mechanism is essential. The "proof" acts as confirmation that a participant has met the requirements to validate a block of transactions, signifying their good-faith participation. One such consensus algorithm employed to generate new blocks, distribute new cryptocurrency, and validate transactions is proof of stake (PoS).
This mechanism provides an alternative to the original consensus method, proof of work (PoW). Rather than the energy expenditure necessitated by PoW, PoS requires validators or miners to make contributions to the network from their own holdings of the blockchain's native cryptocurrency, i.e., their “stake.”
To avoid losing their stake, validators are incentivized to operat…]]></summary>
