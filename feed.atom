Championed by Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, the proposed ETF is aiming to gain the coveted approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
 
Lee, brimming with optimism, recently spoke about the prospects of a Litecoin ETF. His confidence stems from the structural similarities between Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin (BTC).
 
Both currencies utilize the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, a factor that Lee believes positions Litecoin favorably for an ETF classification. Additionally, Lee argues that the altcoin’s status as a commodity strengthens its case for ETF eligibility.

Zhao, better known in the crypto world as “CZ,” received four months in prison for failing to implement sufficient anti-money laundering (AML) safeguards at Binance.
 
 
Binance Founder: Guilty But Not Laundering?
 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) did not directly accuse Zhao of money laundering itself. Instead, the charges focused on his company’s inadequate AML programs, which allegedly allowed criminals to funnel illicit funds through the exchange.
 
This distinction proved crucial in the sentencing, with some legal analysts suggesting federal guidelines for nonviolent first-time offenders limited the judge’s options.

Kurt S. Altrichter, a notable financial advisor, has provided an in-depth analysis of possible outcomes and their ramifications on X, offering a roadmap of expectations for market participants.
 
Altrichter points out that despite the scaling back of rate cut expectations—from six expected cuts at the start of the year to just one by year’s end—the markets have shown resilience. This is largely because investors still anticipate the next Federal Reserve move to be a cut, not an increase. For the crypto market, this has meant a precarious …]]></summary>
