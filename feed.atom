        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CleanSpark Inc. has announced the completion of phase two of its mining campus expansion in Washington, Georgia. The expansion is expected to increase CleanSpark's bitcoin mining compute power by 1.8 exahashes per second (EH/s) to a total of 8.5 EH/s. The company has set lofty goals of reaching a target of 16 EH/s by the end of the year. The Washington campus has a power capacity of 50 megawatts (MW) and currently operates over 10,500 mining machines, with a total investment of over $100 million.
Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, expressed his appreciation for the successful execution of the expansion, highlighting the technical expertise and support from the local community. He stated, "This expansion has already helped us get more than halfway to our year-end guidance of 16 EH/s."
CleanSpark has been actively pursuing growth opportunities, particularly during the recent bear cycle. Last month, the company acquired a turnkey bitcoin mining campus in Dalton, Georgia, consisting of two sites, for $9.3 million. In addition to that, in the same month the company announced the acquisition of more than 12,000 cutting edge mining machines. 
The expansion in Washington, Georgia, has marked another milestone for CleanSpark as it continues to increase its bitcoin mining capacity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dapper Labs, the tech firm and non-fungible token (NFT) creator, has announced its second round of staff layoffs in less than a year. The move comes amid a more broadly challenging market environment for NFTs and cryptocurrencies.
 
 
The company behind creating the popular NFT collections, such as CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shots, has announced that it will be parting ways with 51 employees.

The SEC had alleged that Ripple had raised over $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP to investors, which should be classified as securities. 
 
However, the court noted that programmatic XRP sales did not constitute investment contracts, as they lacked the economic reality of institutional sales, which cut in favor of finding “a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon jumped to a five-week high on Thursday, as founders of the token proposed an upgrade that will create a new coin, POL. If approved, MATIC will be replaced with the new token that will function on all Polygon networks. Litecoin also rallied, hitting a one-month high.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) jumped to a multi-week high on Thursday, as traders reacted to the news that some of the project’s founders have proposed replacing the network’s MATIC token.
 
If successful, POL will be the new official token of Polygon, and this news has been boosting the price of MATIC/USD to a peak of $0.7668 today.
 
As a result of this, MATIC moved to its highest point since June 9, when price reached a high at $0.7890.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge in price came after the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 60.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 62.34, with the next visible point of resistance at the 70.00 level.
 
In the event this ceiling is hit, MATIC will likely be trading above $0.8000.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) also surged higher in today’s session, as traders pushed price above the $100.00 mark.
 
Following a low of $94.79 on Wednesday, LTC/USD raced to an intraday peak at $101.45 earlier in the day.
 
Overall, this is the strongest level the token has hit since last Thursday, when it peaked at $105.95.
 
 
The jump comes after bulls rebounded following a breakout below a support point at $95.00, with the RSI hitting a floor of its own at 53.00.
 
Currently, price strength is at a reading of 57.88, with LTC continuing to record higher highs as the day progresses.
 
A ceiling of $102.00 is now the obvious target, and should the price push past this point, there is a good chance LTC hits $105.00 in the coming days.
