Another person people are curious about these days is Alameda Research’s ex-co-CEO Sam Trabucco. The 30-year-old executive left Alameda in Aug. 2022, but since Ellison detailed misconduct happened in 2019, it’s assumed that Trabucco knows a thing or two about what happened.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana fell to a one-month low to start the weekend, as cryptocurrency markets moved lower ahead of Christmas Day. Today’s drop saw the token fall for a fourth straight session, as market sentiment shifted bearish. Uniswap was also in the red on Saturday, with price falling for a second consecutive day.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was in the red on Saturday, as prices moved lower for a fourth straight session.
 
SOL/USD slipped to a low of $11.24 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after the token was trading at $11.95.
 
Today’s drop saw solana fall to its lowest point since November 22, when price hit a low of $10.94.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, Saturday’s decline came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a floor at 34.00.
 
The index is currently tracking at 31.79, with the next visible point of support at the 29.90 level.
 
Should the RSI continue to head to this point, it is likely that solana will fall below the $10.94 level, which was last seen four weeks ago.
 
 
Uniswap (UNI)
 
Uniswap (UNI) also moved lower to start the weekend, as the token extended a recent bear run.
 
Following a high of $5.32 on Friday, UNI/USD fell to an intraday low of $5.20 on Christmas Eve.
 
The move led to uniswap landing on its long-term point of support, with bears likely to force a breakout as the weekend matures.
 
 
As of writing, the token remains marginally above its $5.20 floor, and is currently trading at $5.22.
 
Should this floor be broken, a possible target for sellers will possibly be a floor at $4.95, which was last hit in late November.

Bitcoin has had a defining year in 2022 and, as I look back, I couldn’t be more excited for 2023. We’re at a turning point. It is clear that Bitcoin is starting to cut the dead weight of speculation. All eyes are on us and it’s our responsibility to educate people and governments about why Bitcoin has real-life use cases that will allow money to flow freely and include billions more into the global economy. I’m ready to onboard the next billion Bitcoiners.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-nears-17000-ahead-of-christmas-day/"/>
        <updated>2022-12-24T13:17:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose closer to the $17,000 level on Saturday, despite crypto markets mostly consolidating to start the week. The global cryptocurrency market cap is down 0.32% as of writing. Ethereum was also higher earlier in the day, with prices nearing the $1,230 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) remained under the $17,000 level to start the weekend, as prices continued to consolidate despite earlier gains.
 
BTC/USD hit a high of $16,905.22 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after price was at a bottom, at the $16,793.53 mark.
 
The move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency continue to trade above a key point of support at $16,800.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failed to break above a ceiling at 48.00.
 
The index is currently trading at 46.72, with bulls still attempting to push past the aforementioned point of resistance.
 
On the other hand, should price strength decline below a floor at 45.00, bitcoin will likely move towards the $16,000 level.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also consolidated to start the weekend, with prices edging closer to a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $1,216.34 on Friday, ETH/USD raced to a peak of $1,227.00 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of today’s move, ethereum once again attempted to break out of a key ceiling at the $1,230 level.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the breakout did not occur, mainly due to the RSI also remaining below a ceiling of its own at 47.50.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 47.12, with momentum appearing to be bearish as a result of the direction of moving averages (MA).
 
The 10-day (red) MA extended its downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which typically is a sign of price declines.

Ethereum Exchange Reserves Sharply Down This Year
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, these investors may have been withdrawing with the aim of holding in the long term. The “exchange reserve” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Ethereum currently being stored in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means holders are depositing their coins to exchanges right now. One of the main reasons investors use exchanges is for swapping their ETH to another crypto or for cashing out in fiat. Thus, the exchange reserve can act as the selling supply of the asset, and so any increases in it can h…]]></summary>

The attorneys for the failed crypto exchange sought the bankruptcy judge handling its insolvency case to suspend access to the shares pending confirmation of their genuine ownership.
 
Although it is unclear if FTX owns them, attorneys believe the company likely does.
