a recent filing with the US District Court for the Southern District of New  
York, the regulator argued that it requires more time to review an extensive  
collection of 133,582 documents. 
The extension, if granted by Judge Katherine Failla,

potentially delaying any courtroom proceedings until next year, Cointelegraph  
reported.
