        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FTX saga is still ongoing six months after the crypto exchange crashed but there have been some interesting twists and turns in this story. One of these is founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s (popularly referred to as SBF) insistence on pleading non-guilty despite other important figures at the company such as Caroline Ellison pleading guilty. This time around, the founder insists on his innocence while asking the judge to scrap the case.
 
Sam Bankman-Fried Wants Lawsuit Thrown Out
 
A new filing in the lawsuit against the FTX founder has revealed how SBF is looking to play this one. Apparently, SBF has chosen to stick to his guns and continue to plead not guilty. The filing in the Manhattan Federal Court also shows that the disgraced founder wants the charges against him to be thrown out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liechtenstein’s prime minister has reportedly revealed that bitcoin payments will be accepted for some government services. “A payment option with bitcoin is coming,” he said, adding that he is open to investing state reserves in the cryptocurrency.
 
Bitcoin Adoption in Liechtenstein
 
Daniel Risch, Liechtenstein’s prime minister who also serves as the country’s finance minister, has reportedly revealed that Liechtenstein plans to accept bitcoin payments for certain government services. He said in an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt Sunday without giving a specific timeframe:
 

A payment option with bitcoin is coming.
 
Risch explained that Liechtenstein plans to accept bitcoin and immediately exchange BTC for Swiss francs, the national currency, in order to avoid exchange-rate risks. He also clarified that the cryptocurrency would not be granted equal status as the Swiss franc.
 
The prime minister additionally told the news outlet that he was open to investing state reserves in bitcoin in the future.
 
 
Liechtenstein’s reserves, currently amounting to approximately 2.23 billion Swiss francs ($2.51 billion), are invested mostly in securities, Handelsblatt reported, citing the finance ministry.
 
Risch was further quoted by Reuters as saying:
 

Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are still too risky. But this assessment can of course change.
 
In October 2019, Liechtenstein’s legislature approved the “Token and Trustworthy Technology Service Providers Act” (abbreviated TVTG in German). The government noted in its announcement at the time that with the new law, Liechtenstein becomes the first country to comprehensively regulate the token economy.

According to the report, the opportunities for digital payment service providers like Ripple in Africa are overwhelming. While the region has already made significant progress in recent years, much of the potential is still untapped, it says. By 2025 alone, electronic payments revenue is expected to grow 20% to $40 billion.
