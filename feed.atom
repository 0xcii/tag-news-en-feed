Bitcoin Whales Distributed Coins Equivalent To 60% Of Mined Supply In The Last 12 Months
 
As per data from Glassnode, whales, miners, and exchange outflows were the primary distribution sources in the past year.

NFT projects on non-Ethereum chains aspire to see levels of liquidity achieved by top Ethereum-based projects, while Ethereum-based NFT collections see the ‘bigger fish in a smaller pond’ opportunity with leaner non-Ethereum chains. There are plenty more potential motivations for projects to move across chains – or grow beyond just one chain – and for the first time in recent months, this is action that we’re finally seeing come to life.

The case is expected to drag on into the second half of 2023 but Grayscale has come forward to reveal its plans if the court were to side with the SEC.
 
Still Not Backing Down, Plans To Appeal
 
Oral arguments in the Grayscale Investments lawsuit against the SEC have been scheduled for March 7, 2023. The date came earlier than expected but has been accelerated due to Genesis filing for bankruptcy and possible liquidity issues at parent company Digital Currency Group, the umbrella under which Grayscale operates.

        <updated>2023-01-25T16:34:23.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin slipped to a five-day low on Wednesday, as the meme coin fell for a second straight session. The move saw prices drop by over 5%, edging closer towards a key price floor in the process. Polygon also extended recent declines, hitting its weakest point since January 19.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped to a five-day low on Wednesday, as the global cryptocurrency market cap fell by as much as 3% today.
 
Following a low of $0.08919, DOGE/USD fell to an intraday low of $0.08245 earlier today.
 
The move saw dogecoin hit its lowest point since January 20, which is the last time prices were trading at a floor of $0.080.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the decline took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a support level of its own at 55.00.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has now shifted its direction, and appears to be on course for a downward trend.
 
Should this take place, and result in a crossover with the 25-day (blue) moving average, then DOGE will likely be trading below $0.080.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was also in the red on hump day, with the token moving lower for a third consecutive day.
 
MATIC/USD fell below the $1.00 mark in today’s session, as prices slipped to a low of $0.938 earlier in the day.
 
Similar to dogecoin, today’s decline has pushed polygon to its weakest point since last Thursday, when prices were trading at a floor of $0.940.
 
 
Looking at the chart, price strength also edged lower, with the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a floor of 58.00.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 55.96, with a floor of 53.00 the next possible target for bears.
 
Bulls have so far rejected this advance, with MATIC rebounding from earlier lows, currently sitting at $0.9588, at the time of writing.
