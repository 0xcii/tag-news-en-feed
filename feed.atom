        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Florida Governor and U.S. presidential candidate Ron DeSantis has promised to end Joe Biden’s war on bitcoin and cryptocurrency if he is elected president of the United States. In addition, he stressed that on his first day as president, “CBDC goes into the trash can. We’re not going to allow it.”
 
Ron DeSantis’ Promises on Bitcoin, Crypto, Central Bank Digital Currency
 
Florida Governor and U.S. presidential candidate Ron DeSantis made several promises regarding bitcoin and cryptocurrency during his speech Monday at a campaign rally in New Hampshire.
 
“We are going to let Americans invest in things like bitcoin and cryptocurrency. No one’s forcing you to do it. If you want to do it you can do it,” DeSantis emphasized, adding:
 

Biden’s war on bitcoin and cryptocurrency will come to an end when I become president.
 
DeSantis also reiterated his promise to stop the Fed from launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC). “We also will reject the Federal Reserve’s attempt to impose a central bank digital currency on the American people,” the presidential hopeful emphasized, elaborating:
 

As president, on day one, CBDC goes into the trash can. We’re not going to allow it.
 
 
Noting that the Fed wants to “go to a cashless society,” DeSantis opined: “They want to eliminate cryptocurrency and they want all the transactions to go through this central bank digital currency.” He noted that he recently signed legislation in Florida where “we don’t recognize central bank digital currency.” The Florida governor has repeatedly said that “CBDC is a massive threat to American liberty.”
 
DeSantis has also promised to protect the right to use bitcoin. He said in May: “You have every right to do bitcoin, the only reason bureaucrats in DC don’t like bitcoin is that they can’t control it. As president, we’ll protect your right to use bitcoin.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has recently issued a ruling stating that United States cryptocurrency investors who receive rewards from staking services are required to include the value of those rewards in their gross income.
 
On July 31, 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2023-14, providing clarity on the tax implications for individuals engaging in staking activities. Income realized in any form, such as money, property, services, or staking rewards, is considered part of the gross income.
 
According to the recent Revenue Ruling 2023-14 by the IRS, this definition encompasses various sources of earnings for tax purposes. Therefore, taxpayers must include any income obtained from staking digital assets on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains as part of their annual income.

According to Michael Will, the President of the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision, the regulator has expressed apprehensions regarding WLD’s ambition to handle “sensitive data on a very large scale.”
 
Will stated that the German watchdog is spearheading the investigation into Worldcoin’s data collection and storage procedures. This inquiry falls under the purview of European data protection rules due to the presence of a subsidiary of Tools for Humanity, the company responsible for the project, in Germany.
