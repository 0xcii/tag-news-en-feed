A proposal released today (Monday) detailed that Aussie crypto exchanges would need to obtain a license from the local financial services regulator.
New Crypto Rules in Australia
Still, at a consultation stage, the Aussie government seeks feedback on its proposal until 1 December 2023. Consultation on the draft bill will continue next year.
