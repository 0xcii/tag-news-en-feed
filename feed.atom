intervene and secure the executive's release, Bloomberg reported.
In a recent letter, sixteen Republican congressmen,  
led by Michael McCaul, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, urged  
President Biden to address the detention of Tigran Gambaryan, a US citizen and the Head of Financial Crime Compliance at Binance. Gambaryan has been held in a  
Nigerian prison since April, following his detention during a trip to discuss  
Binance’s compliance issues with Nigerian authorities.
Lawmakers' Allegations and Nigerian Response
The congressmen termed the charges against the

This Crypto Development Is Bigger Than BlackRock
 
In his memo, Hougan outlines the significant, yet underappreciated shifts in Washington D.C.’s attitude towards digital assets. “Few outside the crypto bubble seem to notice Washington’s evolving attitude toward crypto. That could spell alpha,” Hougan writes, pointing to the recent bipartisan movements in US legislation that signal a warming stance towards digital assets.

NEW: 🇺🇸 #Bitcoin ETFs saw $886 million in inflows yesterday, the 16th straight day of inflows. 
We are so back 🙌 pic.twitter.com/Er2KDgXr9E
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 5, 2024
  
  
  
The ETFs have now seen 16 straight days of inflows, sparking talk of a "second wave" of demand. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund led inflows with $378.7 million, followed by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust at $274.4 million.
In total, the spot Bitcoin ETFs hold over $60 billion worth of BTC. Analysts cite renewed institutional interest and Bitcoin's price resurgence back above $70,000 as drivers of the latest wave of inflows.
It's the highest daily intake for the funds since March 12, when they took in a record $1.04 billion. The next day, Bitcoin went on to hit an all-time high of $73,679, showing the potential impact of the inflows.
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust also saw a rare inflow day of $28.2 million, just the seventh since converting to a spot ETF in January. It joins the renewed enthusiasm despite bleeding funds for most of the year.
With major firms like Fidelity and BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETFs now holding tens of billions in assets, the infrastructure for institutional Bitcoin investment continues maturing.
The latest inflow wave follows Australia, the U.K., and Thailand's recent approval and listing of Bitcoin-regulated funds. With the regulatory climate warming worldwide, Bitcoin ETFs are attracting capital once again.]]></summary>
