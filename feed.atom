        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent interview with Vishal Sacheendran, Director of MENA and Europe at Binance, he provided insights into the upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. Vishal, who previously worked for a financial regulator in Abu Dhabi, explained that MiCA is a comprehensive set of regulations for cryptocurrencies that treats them as financial services. He highlighted that MiCA brings uniformity to the registration and anti-money laundering requirements for crypto asset service providers across Europe, allowing for passporting of licenses throughout the region.
When asked about the impact of MiCA on Bitcoin specifically, Vishal stated that MiCA does not differentiate between different cryptocurrencies and treats them all equally. He mentioned that while MiCA is not the first r…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-bch-hits-1-year-high-as-edx-markets-rally-intensifies/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-27T16:08:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash rose to a one-year high on Tuesday, as traders continued to buy the token following last week’s EDX markets listing. The newly formed exchange, which is backed by the likes of Citadel, Sequoia Capital and Fidelity, listed the coin in its offering. Litecoin was another token added to the exchange. 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was one of Tuesday’s notable gainers, as the token surged to a one-year high.
 
Following a low of $197.30 to start the week, BCH/USD raced to an intraday peak of $236.64 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s peak bitcoin cash moved nearly 18% higher, hitting its strongest point since May 2022 in the process.
 
 
From the chart, a breakout above a ceiling at 80.00 on the relative strength index (RSI) appears to be one of the reasons for today’s surge.
 
The index is now tracking at 82.55, which is deep in overbought territory, and comes as price rose by 120% in the last seven days.
 
Bears are likely already circling the token, anticipating a potential change in direction in the coming days.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was another token to be listed on the EDX platform, however prices have not risen to the extent of BCH.
 
LTC/USD snapped a three-day losing streak on Tuesday, climbing to a peak of $89.90 earlier in the day.
 
This comes less than 24 hours after the cryptocurrency fell to a bottom at $86.42, despite a recent crossover of moving averages.
 
 
The 10-day (red) moving average rose above its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which typically signals bullish momentum.
 
In order for this to truly materialize, a breakout of an upcoming ceiling at 58.00 on the RSI will need to occur.
 
As of writing, price strength is now tracking at 56.30.

Bitcoin Miners Have Sent $128 Million To Exchange Addresses
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Bitcoin miners have sent a record amount of their revenue to exchanges recently. The relevant indicator here is the “percent miner revenue sent to exchanges,” which measures the Bitcoin miner inflows to exchanges in terms of the percentage of their total daily revenue.
 
When the value of the indicator is high, it means that the miners are sending a high amount to exchanges compared to their daily revenue right now. Generally, these chain validators deposit their coins to exchanges for selling-related purposes.

Tom Mutton, who is spearheading the bank’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project, highlighted the uncertainty around the choice of technology in a recent podcast interview with Bloomberg. 
 
During a meeting that brought together numerous technologists to discuss potential designs for the digital pound, the consensus seemed elusive. “None of them agreed with each other at any point,” Mutton said, indicating the broad spectrum of opinions an…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a three-day losing streak, bitcoin rebounded on Tuesday, ahead of the upcoming consumer confidence report in the United States. Price briefly fell below the $30,000 level earlier in the session, however bullish momentum has since returned. Ethereum rose above $1,900 for a short period.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded from recent losses on Tuesday, ahead of the upcoming U.S. consumer confidence report.
 
The Conference Board expects its index to rise to a reading of 104.0 in June, up from 102.3 the month prior.
 
BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $30,751.19 on Tuesday, following a low at $29,955.74 to start the week.
 
 
The move appears to have occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a support point at 68.00.
 
As of writing, the index now sits at a reading of 70.17, which is once again in overbought territory.
 
A barrier at 73.00 is now the next visible ceiling, and unless bulls break out of this point, BTC will likely move back below $30,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) briefly rose above the $1,900 level in today’s session, after falling towards a support level of $1,830 on Monday.
 
Following a low of $1,840.22 to start the week, ETH/USD jumped to a peak at $1,905.36 earlier in the day.
 
Momentum has since shifted, with the world’s second largest cryptocurrency once again falling below the $1,900 level.
 
 
At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,881.79, with the RSI marginally below a resistance level of 58.00.
 
Overall, momentum is bullish, following a recent crossover between the 10-day (red) moving average, and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should this cross mature, there is a good chance that ETH will not only move above $1,900, but closer to $2,000.
