        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last six months, the value of an ounce of gold has witnessed a 3.8% surge in relation to the U.S. dollar. Within the realm of cryptocurrencies, there exist two noteworthy tokens backed by gold: pax gold (PAXG) and tether gold (XAUT). Together, these tokens amass a considerable worth of nearly $1 billion. Although the total number of PAXG and XAUT tokens reaches nearly 500,000, their distribution is relatively concentrated, amongst the 31,000 token holders.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-turmoil-market-slump-heavy-liquidations-and-unexpected-gainers/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-18T17:42:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a volatile twist, the cryptocurrency market experienced a 0.82% decrease in value within the last day, descending to $1.2 trillion. This transpired as bitcoin (BTC) faced unstable conditions, dropping below the crucial $30K mark on Tuesday.
 
Crypto Market in Flux
 
Throughout this chaotic 24-hour period, leveraged digital asset traders observed a colossal liquidation of $106.88 million, impacting both short and long positions. Amid the slump on July 18, the crypto asset 1inch (1INCH) surfaced as the most severe casualty, losing nearly 16% of its worth against the U.S. dollar.
 

 
Amidst the turmoil, other digital assets encountered sharp declines as well. Terra classic (LUNC) suffered the most, plummeting over 6%, while solana (SOL) didn’t fare much better, also losing around 6% of its value. Although numerous coins have seen losses, some have managed to withstand the downturn. For example, bitdao (BIT) has increased more than 2% and chainlink (LINK) has gained 4.65% against the U.S. dollar.
 

 
Other frontrunners on Tuesday encompass sui (SUI), apecoin (APE), and xdc network (XDC). In terms of liquidations over the past hour, BTC, XRP, BCH, and ETH lead in liquidated positions. While crypto markets have undergone a widespread decline, this week’s Bitfinex Alpha Report states that bitcoin investors are “behaving more bullishly.”
 
 
The report highlights that onchain movements in Bitcoin indicate a transfer of supply from long-term holders (LTHs) to short-term holders (STHs), a cycle typically observed in bullish markets.
 
“This shift hints at new market entrants seeking quick profits and long-term holders cashing in on favourable prices. As this trend plateaus, it signals an early bull market stage where supply change occurs between these two cohorts,” the report elaborates.

Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Are Dominated By The Short-Term Holders
 
According to the latest weekly report from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the short-term holders have been actively making inflows since February of this year.
 
The “short-term holders” (STHs) here refer to the investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. The STHs make up one of the two major cohorts in the Bitcoin market, with the other group being the “long-term holders” (LTHs).
