Speaking directly to the American public, Hoskinson stressed the pivotal role blockchain technology could play in the countryâ€™s economic, political, and social fabric. He warned that re-electing President Joe Biden could spell disaster for the American cryptocurrency industry.
 
 
Hoskinson didnâ€™t mince words in his critique of the Biden administration. On social media platform X, he voiced his frustration with the absence of a Democratic primary, which he believes would have exposed Bidenâ€™s waning performance. He questioned why the public continues to tolerate the current situation and highlighted the need for genuine alternatives in leadership.
