rumours that it was laying off employees to cut cost.
"Binance is not

gone through a talent density audit and resource allocation exercise every six

Prosecutors Stand by Charges
In late  
2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas over the collapse of the now-bankrupt  
cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. The arrest came after criminal charges were filed  
against him in the United States. Some of the charges include conspiracy to commit wire, bank and

money laundering and make unlawful political contributions.

This issue was first mentioned on April 25 in the ord github and the interim fix proposed by then lead developer Casey Rodarmor was to, “Modify ord to recognize the above currently invalid inscriptions, including retroactively in old blocks, but consider these new inscriptions ‘cursed’ and assig…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liquidators in charge of the recovery of assets for the now-disgraced Alameda Research hedge fund founded by Sam Bankman-Fried currently control over $110 million worth of bitcoin held in various wallets, according to a report supplied by blockchain analysis firm Arkham Intelligence. These wallets have been receiving BTC from exchanges and cold wallets as recently as March 2023, the report revealed.
The aggregation of these wallets provides insights into the liquidators' collection of BTC from Alameda's holdings. A recent transaction in April involved a 1 BTC test from Alameda's Merchant wallet. This BTC was later sent to a holding address now under the control of Alameda's Liquidators, known as 'Alameda Merchant 1.' Since the beginning of 2023, this address has accumulated 3,581 BTC, worth approximately $97.19 million at current prices.
The report states that “In total, Alameda’s liquidators have managed to secure 4,083 BTC (currently $110.81M) sourced from:

Other Alameda Wallets: 34.94 BTC (currently worth $948.27K)
Deribit: 467.366 BTC (currently worth $12.68M)
WBTC Custodian: 2997 BTC (currently worth $81.34M)
Bitfinex: 298.027 BTC (currently worth $8.09M)
Unlabelled Wallets (possibly an Exchange): 286.7 BTC (currently worth $7.78M)”

“However, this is only a fraction of the BTC that Alameda controlled in the past,” the report noted. “Wallets connected to this network of Alameda’s BTC activity were worth at peak over $800M, with Alameda likely holding more BTC in Centralized Exchanges or unlinked Cold Wallets.”
Arkham Intelligence stated that it will continue to monitor the on-chain activity of Alameda’s liquidators.]]></summary>
