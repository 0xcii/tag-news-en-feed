After its launch, Ethereum users could withdraw their stake ETH from the “Beacon Chain,” the platform that initially supported the PoS migration. As a result, there is much speculation about the potential impact on the market.
 
As of this writing, Ethereum is rallying and seems poised to continue its uptrend beyond the $1,900 area and into the $2,000 region. However, the last time the cryptocurrency underwent a major upgrade, it was followed by a market sell-off and a decline into critical support zones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nine days after publicly listed company Microstrategy purchased 6,455 bitcoins, the firm’s CEO, Michael Saylor, announced the purchase of an additional 1,045 bitcoins. The business intelligence (BI) company now holds a total of 140,000 bitcoins, worth $3.97 billion.
 
Microstrategy Buys Another Batch of Bitcoins
 
Microstrategy has begun acquiring bitcoin (BTC) again, after purchasing 6,455 bitcoins for $150 million on March 27. On April 5, the firm’s CEO announced that it had acquired an additional 1,045 bitcoins, bringing the company’s total holdings to 140,000 BTC. The publicly traded company now has the largest stockpile of bitcoins of any firm worldwide, representing 0.667% of the 21 million BTC supply cap.
 
“Microstrategy has acquired an additional 1,045 bitcoin for ~ $29.3M at an average price of $28,016 per bitcoin,” Saylor tweeted on Wednesday. “As of 4/4/2023 Microstrategy holds 140,000 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.17 billion at an average price of $29,803 per bitcoin.”
 
 
The publicly traded company with the second-largest holding of BTC is Galaxy Digital, with 40,000 BTC. Microstrategy’s stockpile of bitcoins is the same size as Block.one’s and 1,686 BTC smaller than the Mt. Gox bitcoins held by the bankruptcy court trustee in Tokyo. Microstrategy has been acquiring bitcoins since August 2020 and has employed the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy for its investments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reactions have been pouring in  
from the cryptocurrency community after Paxful, a peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for  
trading Bitcoin (BTC), announced on Wednesday that it “will be suspending its marketplace.” Ray Youssef, Paxful's Founder and CEO, in a blog post published on Wednesday on the trading platform’s website said the platform was closing down due to key staff exit and  
regulatory challenges.
“This will probably come as a  
big shock to many. While I cannot share the full story now, I can say that we  
unfortunately have had some key staff departures. Also, regulatory challenges  
for the industry continue to grow, especially in the peer-to-peer market and
