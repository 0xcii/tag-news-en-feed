Fears of inflation and geopolitical tensions sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, dragging Bitcoin and its altcoin brethren down to depths not seen since early 2024. Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, plummeted to as low as $56,500 this week, a far cry from its record highs of over $70,000 in March.
 
 
However, amidst the carnage, some analysts are seeing signs of a potential short-term recovery. This optimism stems from a confluence of factors, including renewed accumulation by major investors, favorable technical indicators, and historical price patterns.

This steady growth would continue into the start of April, but since then, the price has been on a downtrend.

Historical Price Action Places BTC Above $90,000 In Coming Months
 
One analyst, posting on platform X, offered a bold prediction based on price action from late 2022. Then, Bitcoin spectacularly collapsed to as low as $15,500 before bouncing back sharply throughout 2023 and Q1 2024.
