        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fresh data indicates a continuing decline in non-fungible token sales, dipping 3.2% in the last week and plummeting 34% over the past month. As September nears its end with six days remaining, NFT sales have tallied up to $341.37 million since August 24.
 
NFT Sales Still Can’t Escape Crypto Winter’s Wrath
 
This September, over the last seven days, NFT sales touched $78.88 million, marking a 3.2% dip from the preceding week, according to cryptoslam.io stats. 2023 has seen a consistent slump in digital collectible sales, and September is no exception.
 

 
The monthly tally stands at $341.37 million, a sharp 34.08% decline from the previous month. Ethereum continues its dominance in NFT sales, raking in $177,743,112 over the last month.
 

 
However, it’s worth noting that ETH-centric NFT sales have dropped by 41.84% since the month prior. Trailing Ethereum is the Mythos blockchain, registering $31.89 million in sales — a notable 24.86% surge from the month before. Following Mythos are Polygon, Solana, Immutable X, and Bitcoin in terms of 30-day sales.
 
Dmarket, Draftkings, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Gods Unchained, and Sorare top the charts in 30-day sales records. However, the latter three NFT collections faced setbacks this month, while Dmarket and Draftkings enjoyed upticks ranging between 15% and 24%.
 
 
Ethereum’s crowning NFT sale this month was a “Mega Zombie,” fetching a price of $800,044. Immutable X’s “Cross the Ages #223963” took second place, selling for $151,012. Rounding off the top three was a Bitcoin-based NFT from the “OCM Dimensions” collection, which garnered $106,708.
 
2023 has proven challenging for NFT investors, with prices taking a substantial hit. It’s been a chilling crypto winter, and NFTs haven’t been spared its icy grasp. The industry awaits, with bated breath, to see if NFT markets will find their spring resurgence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been a quiet week of caution for Bitcoin traders in terms of price action. This caution has trickled into trading volume in particular, as volumes on major crypto exchanges for both spot Bitcoin trading and Bitcoin derivatives have fallen far below their levels at the beginning of the year. 
 
On-chain data from CryptoQuant charts have shown the daily spot and derivatives trading volume of Bitcoin has been steadily declining since the first quarter of the year. The question is, what does this collapse in trading volumes mean for the future price of Bitcoin?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, Ethereum has seen a shift towards inflation, sparked by a dip in network activity and onchain fees. Data reveals that, with decreased activity and lower fees, Ethereum’s inflation rate stands at 0.270%. The decline in overall activity and people transitioning to layer two (L2) networks has notably curtailed base fee burning.
 
From Deflation to Inflation: Ethereum’s Issuance Rate Changes Course
 
After The Merge and up until three months ago, Ethereum’s supply trended deflationary. Historical data highlights that on May 27, 2023, ultrasound.money pegged Ethereum’s inflation rate at -0.654% annually. Yet, by September 23, 2023, this rate had risen to 0.270%.
 
 
Ethereum’s shift towards deflation was driven by two landmark events: the implementation of EIP-1559, known as the London hard fork, and The Merge‘s switch from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).
 
After the implementation of EIP-1559, an Ethereum transaction’s base fee now gets “burned” by sending it to a null address. Post-Merge, the rate of issuance declined notably. Had it not been for the transition from PoW, the inflation would have touched a considerable 3.689% per annum.
 
 
All this in view, there’s been a pronounced lull in daily transactions, with significant lows around mid-year and another as we approached the end of August and early September. In fact, September 10 saw a dip to 866,548 transactions, a fall of 62,852 from the day prior.
 
 
Moreover, Ethereum’s network fees have been on a downward trajectory, mirroring the reduced activity. This decline has persisted since May 2023, with September 9 and 10 marking the year’s lowest daily fees.
 
On the flip side, layer two (L2) networks have experienced heightened activity, leading to a drop in Ethereum blockchain transactions. This dynamic has resulted in fewer base burns, tempering the deflationary pressure on issuance.

Thanks to OpenTimestamps, a tool created by bitcoin developer Peter Todd a few years ago, Guatemalan tech startup Simple Proof is able to safeguard key documents about the country’s presidential elections from fraud and tampering. Todd’s tool, which leverages hash functions and the bitcoin blockchain, is able to timestamp pieces of information and make it easier to spot attempts at fraud and manipulation.
The idea of timestamping documents is fairly old. Individuals and societies have relied on this technique for centuries to indicate when a document was signed, when a cheque was written, or when someone was born. Cryptographic timestamps, however, are much newer. They take the concept of human timestamping a step …]]></summary>

However, new stablecoin asset projects, such as Aave’s GHO, First Digital’s FDUSD, and Paypal’s PYUSD, have emerged. On September 1, a stablecoin protocol named Prisma Finance was launched, enabling users to deposit liquid staking derivative tokens for a token called MKUSD. Since its inception, the protocol has secured $55 million in locked value.

Coinbase Shows Interest In Acquiring FTX Europe
 
Reports from Fortune show that the crypto exchange Coinbase was interested in acquiring FTX Europe after its parent company FTX went bankrupt in November last year due to its highly profitable derivatives business and growing customer base.
 
The crypto exchange has shown its interest in acquiring the European arm of FTX on two occasions. The first was when the parent exchange went bankrupt in November last year, and now in September 2023.

        <updated>2023-09-23T14:12:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was a notable mover to start the weekend, as the meme coin rose for a second consecutive session. The surge comes despite the global crypto market cap mostly consolidating today. Chainlink also raced higher, hitting a five-week high.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) continued to move away from a recent support point on Saturday, as the price rose for a second straight day.
 
SHIB/USD peaked at $0.000007391 earlier in the day, which comes following a low of $0.00000725 the day before.
 
The move saw shiba inu distance itself from a floor of $0.00000710, moving closer to a ceiling of $0.00000760 instead.
 
 
As the price approaches this point of resistance, the 10-day (red) moving average also nears an upward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In order to reach this point, bulls will first need to orchestrate a move beyond a ceiling of 44.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is tracking at 42.46.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) was another big mover to start the weekend, as the price surged to a multi-week high.
 
After falling to a low of $6.73 on Friday, LINK/USD jumped to a peak of $7.13 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the surge, chainlink climbed to its strongest point since August 15, when the price peaked at $7.42.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the rally led to a resistance level at $6.90 being broken, however, price uncertainty has begun to creep in.
 
LINK is now trading at $7.00, which comes as the RSI struggles to jump over a hurdle at 64.00 on the RSI.
