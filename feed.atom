Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have received a lot of attention recently as a  
potential game changer in the world of finance. A CBDC is a digital  
representation of a country's fiat currency issued and supported by the central  
bank. 
While the concept  
of a digital currency is not new, the concept of a CBDC has gained popularity  
due to the potential advantages it offers over traditional currencies. This  
article will look at CBDC adoption and whether they are the future of finance.
CBDCs Have  
Many Advantages
One of the  
primary advantages of CBDCs is their ability to provide faster and more

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum moved above $2,000 on Thursday, as markets continue to react to the successful Shanghai update. The upgrade, which is also known as “Shapella,” took place late last night, enabling withdrawals on the blockchain. Bitcoin remained above $28,000.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade above the $30,000 mark on Thursday, as crypto markets remained buoyed by the latest U.S. inflation report, which fell to 5%.
 
Following a $29,725.57 low on Wednesday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak of $30,462.48 earlier in the day.
 
This move sees bitcoin remain near a ten-month high of $30,584, which it hit during Tuesday’s trading session.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s slight rise in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from its floor at 68.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 69.73, with the next visible point of resistance at 71.50.
 
Should the index move beyond this point, there is a good chance that ethereum will move past $30,500.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Boosted by the Shanghai update, ethereum (ETH) outperformed BTC in today’s session, climbing by around 7% in the process.
 
ETH/USD surged to a peak of $2,007.05 earlier in today’s session, less than a day after trading at $1,882.37.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency hit its highest level since last August.
 
 
This eight-month high came as price strength rose beyond a ceiling at 65.00. It is now at a reading of 69.44.
 
A resistance level of 75.00 appears to be the next hurdle for bulls, and should momentum continue in an upward direction, ETH could move above $2,100 this week.

A well-known American stockbroker and radio personality, Schiff has been a vocal critic of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He has repeatedly argued that the alpha coin is a bubble that will eventually burst, and that investors who buy it are foolish.
 
He has also warned investors to brace themselves for the next potential crash. This dire prediction is causing many in the cryptocurrency community to question the future of Bitcoin.

This is an opinion editorial by Hongumart, a frontline healthcare worker.
Inspired by The Dude, the main character of the 1998 movie “The Big Lebowski” by the Coen Brothers, Dudeism is a way of life, philosophy and religion. The main goal of Dudeism is to apply a modern version of Taoism, an ancient Chinese teaching attributed to Laozi (rising to prominence in the 6th century), combined with ideas from the Greek thinker Epicurus (who lived form 341 to 270 BC), in a manner that reflects the personality of Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski from the film.
