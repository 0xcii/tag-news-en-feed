        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Bitcoin Amsterdam, Trezor unveiled a trio of innovative products designed to simplify and secure the Bitcoin journey for newcomers and novices. The "Trezor Safe" line, featuring the Trezor Safe 3 hardware wallet and the limited edition Trezor Safe 3 Bitcoin only model, marks the company's commitment to self-custody in style. In addition, Trezor introduces the "Trezor Keep Family" of metal backup solutions with its three variants of the Trezor Keep Metal.
 
         
         
         
         
    
"Self custody stands on 3 pillars. security, privacy, and usability. But why even bother with self custody?" said Trezor CEO, Matěj Žák. "More than $4 billion worth of bitcoin and altcoins got stolen through all kind of hacks from exchanges and custodians over Bitcoin's existence."
The Trezor Safe 3 hardware wallet promises to offer a secure and user-friendly means for crypto enthusiasts to protect their digital assets. It comes in four colors, making the protection of cryptocurrency both accessible and fashionable. As part of the 10-year anniversary celebration, Trezor also launches the limited edition Trezor Safe 3 Bitcoin only. This exclusive version is tailored for those who are dedicated to Bitcoin, safeguarding the custody of the original cryptocurrency.
The Trezor Keep Metal backup solutions come in three different variants and serve as mistake-proof, convenient solutions for securing recovery seeds. These metal backups help to ensure the safety of critical information, providing peace of mind in the event of hardware wallet loss or damage.
These hardware wallets aim to ease the transition to self-custody for both newcomers and novices in the world of Bitcoin. "Everything we can possible do in an open source way, we do it," Žák continued. "We are here to make crypto security easy for everyone."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a disclosure on Wednesday, bitcoin mining entity Cleanspark has reserved 4.4 exahash per second (EH/s) of Bitmain’s latest S21 Antminers. The mining company, recognized on the public market, detailed that the consignment is valued at approximately $61.6 million, translating to $14 for each terahash per second (TH/s).
 
Cleanspark Amplifies Mining Capabilities, Snags 4.4 EH/s of Bitmain’s S21 Antminers
 
Cleanspark (Nasdaq: CLSK), a U.S.-based bitcoin mining firm, divulged its procurement of 4.4 EH/s of the fresh S21 miners from mining equipment titan Bitmain. Though the specifics were not openly shared, the dispatch indicates that the Bitmain S21 Antminers boast an efficiency quotient of 17.5 joules per terahash (J/TH), suggesting the purchase likely involved the air-cooled S21 models.
 
These air-cooled S21 models yield 200 TH/s each, necessitating 22,000 units for the company to hit the 4.4 EH/s mark. The apparatuses hold a cumulative worth of $61.6 million, as per Cleanspark.
 
Bitmain is fronting the capital for the residual 20%, with the balance postponed until a year post-delivery, indicating an upfront disbursement of $11.2 per TH/s. The announcement underscores that shipments are slated to kick off in January 2024.
 
 
This acquisition by Cleanspark comes on the heels of Iris Energy securing 1.4 EH/s of Bitmain’s S21 hardware for $19.6 million. Bitcoin mining conglomerates are bracing for the impending reward halving, a mere 196 days out, and enhancing the joules per terahash ratio is crucial for augmenting revenue streams.
 
“Integrating the S21 into our mining operations is in line with our commitment to using the most efficient mining technology,” Zach Bradford, CEO of Cleanspark, explained on Wednesday.
