Dogecoin Open Interest Sees 66.5% Crash
 
In March, the Dogecoin open interest had risen to a new all-time high of $1.91 billion after a month of steady increase. This was followed by an increase in the DOGE price as investors rushed to join the rally and secure gains. This steady growth would continue into the start of April, but since then, the price has been on a downtrend.
 
 
Data from Coinglass shows that on April 1, the total Dogecoin open interest came out to $1.87 billion. But in the space of one week, the open interest had fallen by $600 mil…]]></summary>

For newcomers, especially those in and around retirement age, the idea of investing in or owning bitcoin can evoke reactions from skepticism to disbelief. If you look beyond the popular narratives, however, you might find there is more to the story than first impressions suggest.

Going by past price action, analysts maintain that the coin will surge above $73,800 and register fresh all-time highs closer to or higher than $100,000 in this projected expansion.
 
Historical Price Action Places BTC Above $90,000 In Coming Months
 
One analyst, posting on platform X, offered a bold prediction based on price action from late 2022. Then, Bitcoin spectacularly collapsed to as low as $15,500 before bouncing back sharply throughout 2023 and Q1 2024. 
 
 
Therefore, if Bitcoin follows this formation, the coin will soar to $90,000 and even reach $100,000. While the timefra…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“The institutions are coming.”
Anyone who’s been in the Bitcoin space for any significant period of time has heard some prominent figure within the space utter this phrase.
In August 2020, when MicroStrategy, an American-based business software company, announced it would be purchasing bitcoin to add it to its treasury, many thought that was the beginning of the institutional stampede.
But it wasn’t.
Sure, Tesla bought some bitcoin the following year, only to dump 75% of it soon after.
And so from 2020 through 2023, MicroStrategy was an anomaly. During these years, the company — led by Bitcoin permabull Michael Saylor — remained the only major corporation on Earth to convert a notable portion of its treasury into bitcoin.

Particularly, the price of XRP was recently rejected at $0.66 after a little surge which saw it falling back down as far as the $0.42 price level. The crypto now finds itself ranging between $0.6 and $0.4, which means it has failed to break over new price territories for the past two years. 
 
While some analysts see this trend as XRP still being undervalued, others are of a pessimistic outlook. Analyst Josh Olszewicz is part of the latter group of crypto analysts. In a recent analysis, Olszewicz noted the “dead” state of XRP while discussing the current state of altcoins.
