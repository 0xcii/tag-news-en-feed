After eight transactions totaling 520 BTC from 2012 spent four days ago, an address from 2012 moved 149.99 BTC at block height 809,204 on Sunday afternoon. The wallet, dormant for more than 11 years, began with a value of $853. Today, the cache’s value has surged to a significantly larger net worth of $3.93 million. The following day, an address established on the identical date as the prior 2012 transaction shifted 157.66 BTC in the wee hours of Monday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that underscores MicroStrategy's unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, the software company has added 5,445 more BTC to its corporate treasury.
The latest acquisition, made on September 24, 2023, comes at an average price of approximately $27,053 per Bitcoin, amounting to an investment of $147.3 million.
This purchase brings MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings to a staggering 158,245 BTC, acquired at an average price of around $29,582 per Bitcoin, equivalent to approximately $4.68 billion. 
MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, has been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin, touting it as digital gold and emphasizing its role as a strategic treasury reserve asset. This latest acquisition further cements MicroStrategy's position as one of the most prominent institutional investors in Bitcoin.
The move comes as no surprise to those following MicroStrategy's journey in the world of cryptocurrencies. The company first ventured into Bitcoin investments in August 2020 when it made its initial purchase. Since then, it has continued to accumulate Bitcoin, even using debt to finance some of its acquisitions.
All the while, Saylor has continued to assert that Bitcoin is "underestimated" compared to other crypto market opportunities, as this video from Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo shows. Saylor has repeatedly said that altcoins are overvalued and should be sold.
With the growing recognition of Bitcoin's value as a store of value and a potential hedge against economic uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether more institutions will follow in MicroStrategy's footsteps.]]></summary>

With the help of four distinctive charts, Batten highlighted Bitcoin’s sustainability compared to other major industries. “4 charts, 4 tweets, 4 reasons Bitcoin is the ultimate ESG asset,” stated Batten.
 
The Ultimate ESG Asset: Bitcoin
 
Renewable Energy Dominance: Batten began by emphasizing how BTC mining has ascended to be the “single most sustainably-powered global industry in the world.” Data reveals that a significant 52.6% of the energy for BTC comes from renewable sources. By contrast, the banking sector lags at 39.2%, the industrial sector at 32.0%, …]]></summary>

Bitcoin Farm Found in Venezuelan Jail
A Bitcoin mining farm was dismantled during a mega raid on the Venezuelan penitentiary center of Tocoron, located in the Aragua state.
