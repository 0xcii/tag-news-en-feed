Urgency For Crypto Regulation
 
In the interview, Senator Lummis criticized the aggressive nature of the SEC’s actions, deeming it unnecessary and overreaching. Specifically, Lummis opposed one of the agency’s controversial new crypto policies, “Staff Accounting Bulletin 121,” issued in March 2022.

Bank Blocks Bitcoin Transaction, What’s Going On
 
Bitcoin remains the world’s largest and liquid cryptocurrency, looking at its market cap. Despite this, Bitcoin is not approved as legal tender in most jurisdictions, except El Salvador, where the government accepts BTC as a medium of exchange.
 
 
Still, BTC is designed to not only act as a medium of exchange (MoE), just like money, but also as a store of value, more like gold. The global, borderless nature of crypto means the coin can be …]]></summary>
