The Estonian government recently approved a bill that will significantly increase oversight of cryptocurrency service providers, bringing them under the stricter purview of the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA).
 
This shift marks a significant change from the previous system, where the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) primarily focused on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. The FSA, on the other hand, will implement a comprehensive regulatory framework, including stricter licensing requirements and the power to impose hefty fines of up to €5 million for AML violations. This move signals Estonia’s strong stance against fina…]]></summary>

Another Twist in Do Kwon’s Extradition
The country’s top prosecutor argued that the High Court’s decision to extradite Kwon to South Korea instead of the United States was done in an “abbreviated proceeding” and exceeded the limits of the court’s reach.

Johnsson began by highlighting the profound market reliance on Ethereum’s classification as a non-security, a stance historically acknowledged by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. He stressed the importance of this classification for the functioning of various market mechanisms, stating:
