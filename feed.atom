A three-judge panel in DC's Court of Appeals in Washington ruled that the SEC's denial of Grayscale's proposal was "arbitrary and capricious" in that the SEC failed to explain the difference in treatment between spot bitcoin ETFs and futures bitcoin ETFs. 
The landmark ruling is believed to be a boon to an industry fraught with regulatory uncertainty. Grayscale—said to be the equivalent of a crypto Goldman Sachs for large OTC trades—could pave the way for future decisions that favor the first Bitcoin ETF or any product of its kind.

Hayes’ insights delve into the intricacies of the bond market, highlighting a disconcerting trend that he believes may force the Fed’s hand in bolstering the US economy.
 
He points to a specific phenomenon known as the “bear steepener” as a red flag in the bond market. This term describes a situation in which long-term bond interest rates increase at a faster pace than short-term rates. Historically, the bear steepener has often served as a bearish signal for both stocks and other risk assets.
