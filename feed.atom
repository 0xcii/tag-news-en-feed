Bons’ analysis targets several top L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Blast, ZKSync, Linea and Mantle, among others.

Bitcoin Exchange Netflow Has Turned Deep Red Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, a large number of coins has left the spot exchanges recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “exchange netflow,” which keeps track of the net amount of Bitcoin moving into or out of the wallets attached to all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric is negative, it means the outflows are overwhelming the inflows right now, and a net amount is exiting the wallets of these platforms. This kind of trend could imply the investors are looking to hold onto the long-term, which can naturally be bullish for BTC.

Over the last month, the Fear & Greed Index has been on a steady decline, falling to new yearly lows in the process.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index continues to roll in the Fear territory with a score of 28 out of 100 after enjoying a few months of Greed in 2024. This decline shows the unwillingness among investors to put money into the market, as expectations are that prices will continue to fall.
