attempt, Bitfarms has strongly rejected claims made by Riot Platforms, accusing  
Riot of trying to undermine the company for its own gain. The conflict between the two Bitcoin mining giants has

Kyle Doops, a market expert and host of the Crypto Banter show, shared the development in a recent post on the X (formerly Twitter) platform. The decline in active addresses implies a decrease in transaction volume, which could mean investors are choosing to wait and see how Bitcoin will react, given the state of the market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a significant exodus of funds, with $287.8 million withdrawn across the listed ETFs yesterday, marking the largest single-day outflow since May 1, Farside Investors data reveals. According to Arkham data, the only ETF that did not experience withdrawals was BlackRock, which reported zero outflows.

Fidelity's ETF led the withdrawals, selling $162 million worth of Bitcoin. Grayscale followed with $50 million in outflows, while Ark and Bitwise reported $34 million and $25 million, respectively. Despite these substantial outflows, these ETFs still collectively manage around $50 billion in assets.
Bitcoin saw a remarkable rise in price earlier this year due to the hype and interest surrounding these ETFs, starting 2024 at around $44,000 and reaching an all-time high of $73,770 on March 14. However, the price has since stagnated, hovering below its peak in the $55,000 to $65,000 range. It has been 174 days since Bitcoin hit its all-time high, according to Clark Moody Dashboard.
Despite the recent outflows, spot Bitcoin ETFs have generally maintained strong inflows, with only one month of outflows in the past eight months. This indicates ongoing investor interest in Bitcoin, even as its price stabilizes below its all-time high.

According to Bloomberg, the CFTC settlement requires Uniswap Labs to cease operations that allegedly violate the Commodity Exchange Act. 
 
The agency claims that the leveraged tokens offered by Uniswap constitute commodity transactions that do not meet the delivery requirements mandated for non-eligible contract participants. Such transactions must occur on a designated or registered market, which Uniswap allegedly is not.
