The Elon Effect
Back in October last year, when Elon Musk took over at Twitter, it was understood that he would likely make some significant changes to how the platform operates, and that has indeed been the case.
  
What users were less prepared for was that when they opened the app on Monday, its familiar blue bird logo would have been replaced with an image of a dog, or, more specifically, replaced with the Dogecoin logo.
  
While users not familiar with the crypto world were confused, for crypto traders it was a buy signal, the price of Doge immediately spiked, and it remains, at the time of writing, signi…]]></summary>

The document comes from a lawsuit filed by political activist Laura Loomer against Twitter for violating federal racketeering laws when her account was banned in 2019. What’s interesting are the court filings, which have been shared publicly.
