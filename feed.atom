As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC Open Interest on Binance has risen to $28.3 billion recently. The “Open Interest” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin-related positions currently open on a given platform.
 
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the exchange right now. Generally, more positions imply more leverage in the market, so this trend can lead to more volatility in the asset’s price.

Correlation Between Digital Assets And S&P 500
 
Per the report, the 40-day correlation coefficient for a gauge of the largest 100 digital assets and the S&P 500 Index currently stands at approximately 0.67. This level of correlation has only been surpassed once, during the second quarter of 2022 when it peaked at 0.72.
