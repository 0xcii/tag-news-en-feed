Goldman Sachs, one of the largest financial institutions in the world, shares similar reservations, which appear to have been validated by recent developments in the crypto field.
 
Goldman Sachs forecasts in a research paper published on Monday that the yellow metal, with its actual demand fundamentals, will outshine the volatile cryptocurrency over the long haul, Reuters reported.
 
Gold is less likely to be affected by economic circumstances, making it a “good portfolio diversifier,” according to the lender. This is particularly true considering that gold has demonstrated non-speculative use applications while bitcoin is still searching for this type of validation.

Bankman-Fried, the brains behind the defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was detained in The Bahamas on Tuesday, Bitcoinist reported.  One day after he was collared, the government of the Bahamas chose to refuse him the option of temporary freedom.
