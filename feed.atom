        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a long-awaited conclusion to their high-profile legal clash, Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have reached a settlement that will see the blockchain company pay $125 million in civil penalties.
 
 
Ripple-SEC Legal Saga Ends 
 
According to the court ruling, the key points of the settlement are as follows:
 
 
Ripple will pay $125,035,150 in civil penalties to the SEC, a significant reduction from the regulator’s original $2 billion demand.
 
Ripple was found to have violated securities laws through its “Institutional Sales” of the XRP cryptocurrency, which the court deemed to be unregistered investment contracts.
 
However, the court ruled that Ripple’s “Programmatic Sales” and “Other Distributions” of XRP did not constitute unregistered securities offerings.
 
The court also determined that the individual XRP sales by Ripple co-founders Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse were not investment contract offerings, for “substantially the same reasons” as the Programmatic Sales.
 
 
XRP Price Soars 20%
 
In its analysis, the court noted that while Ripple’s “repeated and lucrative violations of securities laws were a serious offense,” the case did not involve allegations of fraud, misappropriation or other more egregious misconduct. Additionally, the court found that the SEC had not proved that Ripple’s actions caused substantial losses or risk to investors.
 
Ultimately, the settlement marks a significant, if not total, victory for the blockchain payment company, which had fought the SEC’s allegations that XRP was an unregistered security. The company can now move forward without the cloud of legal uncertainty hanging over its business.
 
 
As news of the end of this legal battle unfolded, the price of XRP skyrocketed 20% at the time of writing, trading at $0.6056, after hitting a 1-month low of $0.4315 on Monday amid the broader market crash.

So, this report takes a look at how much you would’ve made if you spent $100 buying BTC 14 years ago from today.
 
Bitcoin Was Trading At $0.05 14 Years Ago
 
Pete Rizzo, author of the Bitcoin History newsletter, shared an interesting tidbit for BTC on the X (formerly Twitter) platform. According to Rizzo, 14 years ago, the Bitcoin price was sitting at a mere $0.05 per coin, a price point which seems impossible looking at it from today’s perspective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, memecoins have captured the imagination of investors worldwide.

Market experts are now confident that Mpeppe will not only challenge but potentially overtake Dogecoin’s dominance in the memecoin sector.

        <updated>2024-08-07T18:59:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin addresses with a balance of over 0.1 BTC are nearing an all-time high, according to data from Bitcoin Magazine Pro. Currently, there are 4,580,424 such addresses, just shy of the record 4,586,540, and represents a month over month increase of 27,939 addresses.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
The recent drop in Bitcoin's price from around $67,500 to $49,000 provided investors a unique buying opportunity, allowing them to accumulate Bitcoin at prices below $50,000. Even with Bitcoin currently trading in the $50,000-$60,000 range, down 24% from its all-time high, buyers continue to accumulate, potentially pushing the number of addresses with over 0.1 BTC to a new record in the near future.
This chart illustrates the number of unique addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC. Tracking this metric helps gauge Bitcoin adoption and usage over time. For instance, an increase in addresses holding small amounts of Bitcoin indicates growing adoption among new users.
A Bitcoin address, consisting of 26-35 alphanumeric characters, allows individuals to send and receive Bitcoin. Each wallet can contain multiple addresses, serving as the public-facing part necessary for transactions.
With Bitcoin’s total supply capped at 21 million, approximately 19 million have been mined to date. Estimates suggest around 3 million of these may already be lost. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction, the number of addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC is expected to rise, reflecting broader adoption and increased usage across various cohorts.
