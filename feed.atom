Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has designated cryptocurrency mixers as a significant

FinCEN has raised issues related to cryptocurrency mixing,

XRP Has Enjoyed A Sharp Rally During The Last 24 Hours
 
In the past day, the cryptocurrency sector as a whole has seen an uplift, led by Bitcoin’s approach to the $30,000 level. XRP has been no exception, as the token has enjoyed returns of 8% during this period, which are in fact more than what BTC itself has managed so far.
 
The below chart shows what XRP’s performance in the past few days has looked like:
 

 
 
At the peak of this sharp rally, XRP had broken above the 0.53 mark, but it has since then declined below the $0.52 level. Even with this pullback, though, the cryptocurrency’s surge remains impressive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was a big gainer on Friday, as markets reacted to the SEC’s decision to drop its lawsuit against Ripple’s management team. The commission previously alleged that CEO Brad Garlinghouse and chairman Chris Larsen had violated securities laws. Solana also surged, rising by over 10% today.
 
XRP
 
XRP rose to a two-week high on Friday, following a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to drop its case against Garlinghouse and Larsen.
 
XRP/USD peaked at $0.5291 earlier in the day, which comes following a low at $0.4831 the day prior.
 
As a result of today’s high, ripple rose to its highest point since October 5, when price peaked at $0.5325.
 
 
Earlier gains have now eased, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to move beyond a ceiling at 57.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 56.32, with the next visible floor at the 50.00 level.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average has also begun to trend upwards, increasing chances of an upwards crossover in the upcoming days.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) surged significantly higher in today’s session, after finally breaking its long-term ceiling at $25.00.
 
After trading at a bottom of $24.17 on Thursday, SOL/USD jumped to an intraday high of $27.29 earlier today.
 
Friday’s move is the highest point that solana has hit since July 20, when price peaked at $27.35.
 
 
As a result of this strong sentiment, SOL has risen into overbought territory, with the RSI climbing to a current reading of 74.60.
 
A point of resistance now awaits current bulls at the 75.00 mark, and should they prevail, solana could capture $28.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the advent of software development kits like BDK and LDK, building a bitcoin wallet has never been easier. However, as much as easier development is necessary, it's important to build in a way that protects user security and privacy by default. For example, how a light wallet connects to a third-party server to receive and send transaction data is an important issue to address.
I believe that bitcoin wallets need block filters to respect a user's privacy. Why? It's the only way to keep data from leaking to the server, which would allow it to link a user's transaction data beyond what is publicly available. 
In this article, we will explore why bitcoin wallets need block filters by first looking at how many bitcoin users run full nodes, how API wallets offer good user experience but ul…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rallied to a three-month high on Friday, as market optimism grew that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could soon approve several spot bitcoin ETFs. As reported yesterday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that the regulator is currently reviewing up to ten filings for the product. This comes as the commission also opted to drop its lawsuit against senior leadership at Ripple (XRP).
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin surged to a multi-month high in today’s session, as markets remained optimistic that the SEC could soon approve several spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
 
BTC/USD surged above $30,000 as sentiment grew, hitting a peak at $30,104.09 earlier in today’s session.
 
This comes following a low of $28,449.96 on Thursday, with today’s peak the strongest point bitcoin has hit since July 23.

On a technical level, the breakout of a ceiling at 69.00 on the relative strength index (RSI) also contributed to the gains.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now at a reading of 71.14, which is in overbought territory.
 
There has also been some slight profit taking in the market, with bitcoin now trading at $29,475.77.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also higher on Friday, with the cryptocurrency once again rising above the $1,600 level.
 
Following a low of $1,553.03 on Thursday, ETH/USD jumped to a peak at $1,628.61 earlier in the day.
 
This resulted in ethereum climbing to its highest point since the start of the week, when price was over $1,640.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Today’s hump comes days after bulls rejected a breakout below a support point of $1,540, and they now look to be targeting resistance of $1,650.
 
In order to get there, the RSI, which is currently reading at 51.81, will need to move beyond its own ceiling at 55.00.
