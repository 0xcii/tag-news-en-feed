        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FutureBit, a renowned innovator in consumer-centric Bitcoin products, today announced the Apollo II, a revolutionary personal home mining device. This new launch marks a significant stride in FutureBit's journey to introduce efficient, potent, and user-friendly mining products for household use. The Apollo II is a fusion of the latest 5nm ASIC technology and a modern, intuitive design, establishing a new benchmark in the personal Bitcoin mining industry.
Accompanying the Apollo II is the newly enhanced Apollo OS 2.0, featuring an integrated personal mining pool within the device itself. This innovation allows individuals, regardless of their technical expertise, to easily engage in solo mining directly to their Bitcoin node, offering a realistic opportunity to mine a complete Bitcoin block. This feature is particularly significant as it aids in the expansion of network decentralization, which is currently dominated by centralized mining pools.
John Stefanopoulos, the founder of FutureBit, emphasized the company's mission, stating, “Our goal is to return Bitcoin to a state where individual users have power over the Bitcoin network and not centralized farms and pools. This can only be accomplished by hardware that combines powerful ASIC hardware and a full Bitcoin node and getting hardware like the Apollo II out to millions of Bitcoin users.”
The Apollo II symbolizes FutureBit's dedication to decentralizing Bitcoin mining and making it accessible to a wider audience while empowering individual users in the Bitcoin network.

Introduction
Until this election cycle, Bitcoin has flown under the radar when it comes to the national political stage. For the first time in its history, Bitcoin is becoming a prominent issue for presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle. While there’s been some mention of Bitcoin from the previous president as well as Bitcoin-related policies made by the current one, this election is shaping up to be Bitcoin’s time in the spotlight.
At this stage in the race, there are a multitude of presidential candidates, each with their own stance on Bitcoin’s place in the national conversation. We have taken the opportunity to reach out to these candidates to hea…]]></summary>

According to court filings, Genesis is free to seek the collection of any outstanding debt in the event that DCG defaults on this arrangement.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ai-focused-cryptocurrency-sector-expands-by-2-billion-in-less-than-2-weeks/"/>
        <updated>2023-11-29T15:32:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent market data reveals a significant surge in the AI-focused cryptocurrency sector, with its value ballooning by nearly $2 billion in just under two weeks. A major contributor to this growth is the token bittensor (TAO), which soared 86.5% in the last fortnight.
 
AI Crypto Economy Rebounds Strongly
 
In the AI-oriented crypto landscape, the past month has been marked by impressive growth. The top six AI tokens have all experienced double-digit percentage increases. TAO leads the pack with a striking 207% rise in the last 30 days. Following closely, fetch (FET) has climbed 46.34%, and covalent (CQT) has risen 41.91% against the U.S. dollar during the same period.
 
 
In the past month, the graph (GRT) experienced a 35% increase, while singularitynet (AGIX) witnessed a 28% uptick in its value. As of 12 days ago, on November 17, 2023, the valuation of the AI-centric crypto economy stood at $3.32 billion. This was a recovery to previous levels, achieved over three months, adding approximately $720 million from its July end low of $2.6 billion.
 
In just the last 12 days, the sector has expanded by an impressive $1.97 billion. This growth is largely attributed to TAO’s rise, escalating from a market value of $329 million on October 29 to today’s $1.297 billion. Cortex (CTXC) also emerged as a significant player in the AI-focused arena, climbing from the 17th to the 11th position in terms of market capitalization.
 
 
CTXC’s market value soared from $37 million to a current $90.62 million, following a 194.12% surge this past month. However, not all AI-centric cryptocurrencies fared well over the same period. GOC, XMON, NEURONI, ARCONA, AMC, DX, XRT, and ALI all recorded double-digit declines during the 30-day timeframe.

In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, the CEO of Geometric Energy, Samuel Reid, announced that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has approved the DOGE-1 Satellite.

assets, regulatory bodies are grappling with the challenge of overseeing crypto

interview, Andrea Enria, chair of the supervisory board at the European Central  
Bank (ECB), emphasized the need to regulate  
crypto entities that act like banks. The looming challenge for regulators,  
according to Enria, is the deterritorialization of these entities, often  
lacking precise headquarters and operating globally.
This call for regulation comes against the backdrop of a broader  
discussion on comprehensive policies for crypto assets. The failures of the FTX

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Ripple Labs, David Schwartz, delivered a nuanced perspective on the complexities surrounding the classification of tokens as securities yesterday. Although he did not mention XRP, it seems clear that he is talking about Ripple’s battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). His analysis delves deep into the intricacies of the Howey test and its application on cryptocurrencies, like XRP.
 
Schwartz opened his post on X by stating, “I’ve talked a little bit about US securities law, and I’m going to do that a little bit more. As most of you know, the primary argument that some tokens are securities comes from the inclusion of ‘investment contracts’ in the list of things that are securities.”
