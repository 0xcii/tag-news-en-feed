To perform a successful 51% attack on the network, bad actors must gain control over at least 51% of the online mining rigs. When the hashrate goes up, the security naturally strengthens, as there are now more machines that an attacker needs to succeed.

The internal agency document obtained by Fortune indicates that the investigation was abruptly closed, leaving many questions unanswered.
 
Dapper Labs Investigation Terminated By SEC Chief
 
Per the report, the SEC’s crypto and cyber unit chief, David Hirsch, terminated the “Dapper Labs, Inc.” investigation on September 29. However, the report does not disclose the reasons for the investigation, the duration, or the factors leading to its closure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin investors have recently seen the crypto stalling at the $0.2 mark as bullish sentiment amongst whales and other traders starts to falter. Interestingly, DOGE has yet to have a tangible breakout above the $0.2 mark since March 31. In fact, the crypto went on a decline in the first week of April to reach as low as $0.1719. 
 
Despite having reversed some of this decline at the time of writing, Dogecoin has yet to perform as many investors would expect. Furthermore, chart formation shows the cryptocurrency could be stuck in a bearish pattern and on-chain data indicates whales are selling their DOGE holdings. At the same time, short-term holders have seen their holdings increase, which makes them vulnerable to selloffs.
