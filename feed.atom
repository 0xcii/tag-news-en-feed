7-Day Average Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Seen A Surge Recently
 
The “mining hashrate” refers to a metric that keeps track of the total computing power the miners have currently connected with the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
When the value of this indicator registers an increase, it means that new miners are joining the network, and old ones are expanding their facilities. Such a trend implies the network is looking attractive to these chain validators.
 
 
On the other hand, the metric going through a decline implies some miners have decided to disconnect from the chain, potentially because they are finding it unprofitable to mine BTC.
