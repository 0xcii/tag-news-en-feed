The top crypto dipped below $38,700 during the week for the first time since early December, following a sell-off from digital asset fund manager Grayscale. However, the crypto is now showing signs of recovery and is now trading above $42,600. 
 
According to a social media post by John Bollinger, the legendary creator of the Bollinger Bands, Bitcoin might be done with the selloff, suggesting that the downtrend is already at a bottom.

Deutsch, who is better known as Mark to many in the crypto space, cautions that the latter two tools have their drawbacks which makes them less ideal solutions.

In his written answers to Bitcoin.com News, Deutsch asserts that perpetual contracts or perps are best suited for short-term but high-leverage strategies. However, in the longer term, perps are expensive to hold, making them less ideal, Deutsch explained. This is further compounded by the fact that perpetual contracts “have no potential for utility across the broader Solana defi ecosystem.” B…]]></summary>

Crypto Hacking Losses Fall  
Over 50% in 2023 but Threat Remains
In 2022,

new report from the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, in 2023, that  
figure dropped to around $1.7 billion, representing a decrease of 54%. 
The main  
driver of this drop was a major decline in decentralized finance (DeFi)  
hacking. After exploding in 2021 and 2022, with over $3 billion stolen in each  
year, funds stolen from DeFi protocols fell by nearly 64% to $1.1 billion in
