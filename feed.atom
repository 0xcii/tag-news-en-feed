Ripple CTO On Naming Controversy
 
Both XRP and Ripple have similar pasts; XRP was once known as “ripples” before taking on its current configuration. Due to this, both parties are sometimes mistaken as one, leading to constant confusion within the entire cryptocurrency community over time.

In an exclusive interview with Reuters on the latest episode of Inside ETFs, Sonnenshein delved into the challenges and transformations faced by the GBTC.
 
Grayscale Investments has been at the forefront of the crypto asset management sector since 2013. The firm encountered heightened competition as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlit spot Bitcoin ETF products from nine other issuers on January 11, ending a prolonged standoff with the crypto industry. This regulatory milestone opened the gates for a variety of investment products, putting Grayscale’s dominance to the test.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 10, 2024
  
  
  
The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has expedited the approval process, positioning Hong Kong as a pioneer in Asia's Bitcoin ETF space. The move comes ahead of industry expectations for launches later this year.
Multiple Chinese financial institutions, including the Hong Kong subsidiaries of Harvest Fund and China Southern Fund, have applied for bitcoin ETFs recently. Spot bitcoin ETFs provide exposure to actual bitcoin rather than derivatives.
According to sources, the SFC will announce its first approved batch of spot bitcoin ETFs on April 15. After approvals, the funds can then be applied to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which is expected to take 10 days.
This accelerated timeline demonstrates Hong Kong's proactive approach in enhancing its appeal as a global financial hub. It also builds on the city's Bitcoin-friendly stance, including granting crypto exchange Hashkey a retail trading license last year.
The news comes after the tremendous success of spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States after approval this January, which attracted over $12 billion in inflows. As the first Asian jurisdiction to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, Hong Kong is paving the way for potential launches in other markets.
Accessible Bitcoin investment products have seen rapid growth in demand among both institutional and retail investors. By leveraging its regulatory framework to meet this appetite, Hong Kong cements its position as a rising Bitcoin hub in Asia.]]></summary>
