“When I first encountered the idea of being able to use the blockchain technology to disintermediate financial intermediaries, I thought, ‘thank God,’” Lewis said of his realizations when first researching Bitcoin. “There are lots of unnecessary hands touching money when financial transactions occur. They've just been kind of hard baked into the system.”

        <updated>2023-05-19T21:06:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard addressed the audience at Bitcoin 2023 today, focusing on the institutional problems with U.S. politics and elected leaders who seek to consolidate power rather than serve constituents.
“I served in Congress for eight years and ran for president in 2020, and while we like to have this idea that we have great courageous leaders in Washington … unfortunately, that’s not the case,” Gabbard said. “Ultimately, they’re driven by a fear of losing power and losing control and, at the heart of it, they’re afraid of us. They’re afraid of a free society.”
In particular, she highlighted the Biden administration’s exploration of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), underscoring how such a project would be antithetical to the privacy- and freedom-preserving qualities of cash transactions. As outlined in its white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto, “Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System,” Bitcoin was designed to preserve these qualities in a digital way.
“The Biden administration’s move toward implementing a central bank digital currency is their latest effort towards exerting control and taking away our freedom,” Gabbard said. “No matter how many flowery words they use to deny that there is ill intent… no matter how many times they say, ‘Hey this is for your own good’... But ultimately, we know this is about their insatiable mission and desire for total control.”
She also suggested that those in power are combative toward or disinterested in Bitcoin because it cannot be manipulated by any third parties.
“You would think they would be interested in how Bitcoin is transforming the lives of people around the world, but they don’t actually care about people,” she said.]]></summary>

International Holdings (MIH), a US-based exchange conglomerate, has finalized

FTX and its

sought permission to  
sell LedgerX and three

Kennedy told the crowd that he was first inspired by Bitcoin as a critical freedom technology after learning about how it was used to circumvent financial restrictions during the Canadian trucker protest last year.

        <updated>2023-05-19T17:26:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitwage, a leading provider of Bitcoin payroll and invoicing, has introduced a solution that allows employers to seamlessly connect their payroll providers to Bitwage's service. This development simplifies and ensures compliance for workers who wish to receive a percentage of their paycheck in Bitcoin, stablecoins or USD. Notably, this solution is compatible with various payroll providers, including ADP, Paychex, Paycom, Gusto, Trinet and many others.
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, what sets Bitwage apart is its non-custodial experience, ensuring that employees receive their payments directly into the wallet of their choice, maximizing security and minimizing risk. 
To implement this solution, companies need to sign up on the Bitwage platform and connect their payroll provider through the Bitwage Automated Connection. From there, Bitwage creates a custom, post-tax benefit on the payroll provider's portal, allowing employees to opt-in. Employees can then choose the amount they wish to be deducted from their paycheck and distributed through Bitwage.
With each pay cycle, Bitwage automatically generates a payroll for each employee based on their payroll preferences, extracting the necessary data directly from the payroll system. Employees can receive their payments directly into their preferred Bitcoin, crypto or stablecoin wallet or even as their local currency into their bank accounts.
Bitwage's CEO, Jonathan Chester, emphasized their mission to enable workforces to be paid in their preferred method, whether it's bitcoin or fiat. “We recognize that crypto can be scary for employers, so to enable this mission, we are building out fully compliant solutions and removing the complexities and custodial risk of crypto from the equation,” Chester said.]]></summary>

This time around, there has been a significant decline in the holdings of these BTC miners, which suggests that they made be selling again.
 
Bitcoin Miner Reserves See Sharp Decline
 
Since the year began, Bitcoin miners have been leaning more toward selling to make ends meet for their operations. This is evident in the declines that have been recorded in their balances after what seemed like a long year of accumulation back in 2022.
 
 
As a result, the current Bitcoin miner balances are sitting at about 50% lower than they did at the start of the year, and it doesn’t seem like they’re done selling. This is because data from Cryp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cosmos fell to a key price floor on Friday, as bearish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. Volatility has been high most of the week, with today seeing the global market cap drop by 0.95% as of writing. Chainlink also slipped in today’s session.
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Cosmos (ATOM) dropped to a key support point on Friday, as bearish sentiment returned to the market.
 
Following a high of $10.92 on Thursday, ATOM/USD slipped to an intraday bottom of $10.50 earlier in the day.
 
The drop in price saw the token collide with its long-term floor, with bulls opting to buy the dip from that point.
 
 
At the time of writing, ATOM is trading at $10.61, which is still almost 3% lower than yesterday’s peak.
 
From the chart, it appears that the shift in momentum came after a failed breakout of a ceiling of 48.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
The index is now tracking at 40.72, which is marginally above an upcoming floor at the 40.00 mark.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
In addition to ATOM, chainlink (LINK) also fell on Friday, extending a recent decline in the process.
 
After a recent four-day bull run, LINK/USD edged lower in today’s session, dropping for a second straight day.
 
LINK/USD hit a bottom of $6.46 during the day, which comes after a high of $6.69 on Thursday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s slippage pushed LINK close to a support point of its own at $6.45.
 
The token has since rebounded, and is currently trading at the $6.51 level, which came as the RSI also hit a floor.
 
Price strength moved to the 40.00 zone earlier in the day, but has marginally risen as the day progressed.
