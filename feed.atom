Shiba Inu Whale Transaction Count Has Spiked Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, SHIB looks to be getting back on the radar of the traders. The indicator of interest here is the “whale transaction count,” which measures the total amount of transactions happening on the blockchain that involve the movement of at least $1 million worth of Shiba Inu.
 
Generally, the only investors in the market who are capable of moving such a large number of tokens with single transactions are the whales. Thus, when the value of this metric is high, it means that the whales are making a large number of moves in the market currently.…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-remains-near-30000-as-traders-prepare-for-key-us-economic-data/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-10T12:58:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a recent slip, bitcoin moved back above $30,000 on Monday, ahead of a key week of U.S. economic data, with the headline being the inflation report. Inflation is expected to drop to 3.1% in June, which would be a nearly two-year low. Ethereum also slipped on Monday, remaining below $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the week trading near the $30,000 level, after the price dropped below this point over the weekend.
 
Following a low of $29,985.39 on Sunday, BTC/USD jumped to an intraday high of $30,427.59 in today’s session.
 
The rebound comes as bears rejected a breakout below a recent support point at the $29,900 level.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
BTC has mostly been consolidating for the past four days, which has led to the 10-day (red) moving average shifting direction.
 
After trending upwards in recent weeks, the moving average now looks as though it has flatlined, giving way to a potential downturn in the coming days.
 
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 57.75, marginally below a ceiling at 58.00.
 
Should it fail to break out, there is a good chance that BTC could decline further in the coming days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) continued to trade below $1,900 on Monday, as price is nearly 5% lower than at the same point last week.
 
ETH/USD slid to an intraday bottom at $1,848.78 to start the week, a day after trading nearly $30.00 higher.
 
Overall, this has resulted in ethereum’s 10-day (red) moving average closing in on a downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Should this occur, the first possible target will be a price floor at $1,815, which was last hit on June 30.
 
Price strength is currently at a reading of 50.35, however should it move under an upcoming floor at 48.00, a sell-off will likely occur.

Daniel Keller, CTO at Eminence and an XRPL ambassador, held a poll via Twitter in which the XRP army was able to vote on whether incentives should be introduced. A whopping 78% answered “yes”, possibly in the belief that the XRP Ledger could adopt an on-chain staking mechanism similar to Ethereum.
