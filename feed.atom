Despite this, the token gained substantial traction upon its launch, attracting many cryptocurrency holders who invested in it.
 
In recent news, a prominent figure in the PEPECOIN ecosystem, known as Dimethyltryptamine.eth, undertook a significant sell-off. The individual sold 180 billion tokens for approximately 149.4 ETH, equivalent to roughly $279,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinfinity, an Austrian bitcoin broker, has recently integrated the Lightning Network into its services, allowing customers to make bitcoin purchases with reduced transaction fees and quicker processing times.
Thomas Burgstaller, Chief Growth Officer at Coinfinity, highlighted the significance of this integration, stating, "Being this early to market is an important innovation step for us at Coinfinity, and Lightning itself is an essential foundation for the global adoption of Bitcoin as a usable monetary system."
The Lightning network, a Layer 2 scaling solution, addresses the limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain by facilitating faster and more cost-effective transactions for smaller bitcoin amounts. By leveraging the Lightning network, Coinfinity aims to enhance Bitcoin's usability as a competitive payment system, surpassing the transaction volumes of major card networks such as VISA or Mastercard.
Customers of Coinfinity can gradually access Lightning features through the company's web portal and mobile app for iOS and Android — currently, users can utilize Lightning to buy bitcoin, after which it will be integrated into the savings plan feature and then the selling function. 
This integration not only offers convenience to users but also contributes to the wider adoption of Bitcoin as a viable means of payment. The move comes as Coinfinity seeks to optimize transaction efficiency and reduce costs associated with traditional bitcoin transactions. 
For further details on Coinfinity's Lightning network integration, interested individuals can read a blog post on the company’s website.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pouch has unveiled its latest app feature, “Send Globally,” aimed at simplifying money transfers from the Philippines to U.S. banks. The feature allows Pouch customers, including expats residing in the Philippines, to send Philippine pesos that will be paid out as U.S. dollars to recipients' U.S. bank accounts.
Ethan Rose, CEO of Pouch, emphasized the company's commitment to enhancing cross-border payments and promoting financial inclusivity, stating, "Enabling Send Globally for Pouch customers is a part of this. With Send Globally, there is no need to go to a physical bank branch to send from the Philippines to US bank accounts. Pouch.ph is accessible to Filipinos from all backgrounds."
The “Send Globally” feature offered by Pouch aims to provide users with fast and cost-effective transactions, with a reduced processing time of zero to three days compared to traditional methods that could take weeks. Additionally, the press release stated that the feature eliminates the risk of payment delays caused by intermediaries and offers competitive rates to enhance affordability for both businesses and individual users.
By leveraging the Bitcoin Lightning Network, Pouch said it aims to facilitate quick and inexpensive transactions, allowing users to send money with ease. Rose highlighted the significance of this collaboration, stating, "This collaboration represents a significant milestone in our mission to provide seamless, affordable, and secure cross-border payment solutions to Filipinos."
To access the feature, users can download the latest version of the Pouch.ph app, available on Google Play and the Apple Store. Pouch said it plans to expand into more markets and establish partnerships with international entities to further enhance payment services worldwide.]]></summary>

The emergence of a discount on crypto assets paired with USD on Binance US has fueled speculation about the affiliate’s future and the fate of users’ funds.
 
Stablecoin Asset Pairs Tracking the True Value of Crypto Assets
 
On July 10 the BTC/USD value on the beleaguered crypto exchange Binance US stood at just over $27,500, about $2,500 below the price prevailing on other centralized exchanges. In contrast, when paired with the stablecoin USDT, the top cryptocurrency’s value of just over $30,100 on Binance’s affiliate in the U.S. was consistent with that on other exchanges.

During the event, Buterin shared his insights on the possibilities for Bitcoin to evolve and expand beyond its traditional role as a payment mechanism.
 
 
He envisions the Bitcoin network adopting scalable solutions such as zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) in order to reach its full potential.
 
He stated:
 

I think if we want Bitcoin to be more than just payments, it will need scaling options like Plasma or ZK Rollups
 
Buterin also noted that Bitcoin’s politics pose a major challenge. He mentioned feeling a lack of alignment with these dynamics, stating that he doesn’t vibe with these dynamics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance coin was one of Monday’s biggest gainers, as the token rebounded following a move close to a key support point on Sunday. The move pushed the price near a one-week high, and came as the global crypto market cap fell 0.07% lower as of writing. Solana also dropped, following a recent bull run.
 
Binance Coin (BNB)
 
Binance coin (BNB) was a notable gainer on Monday, as the token rose by nearly 5% to start the trading week.
 
After falling to an intraday low of $232.01 earlier in today’s session, BNB/USD rose to a peak of $244.80.
 
This resulted in BNB hitting its strongest point since last Tuesday, when the token climbed to a high of $246.90.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that this latest rally occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 48.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 49.33, with the next visible point of resistance at 52.00.
 
Should the index reach this point, there is a good chance that BNB will be near $250.00.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
After climbing to a two-month high last week, solana (SOL) was in the red on Monday, falling for a second straight day.
 
SOL/USD hit an intraday low of $20.57, which comes less than 24 hours after price peaked at $21.53.
 
The move appears to be a result of profit taking, since solana reached its highest point since May 6, this past Saturday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it seems that sentiment is still somewhat bullish, as traders opted to reject a breakout below $20.00.
 
As of writing, the token is trading at $21.09, with the 10-day (red) moving average still upward facing.
 
Overall, the recent decline comes following a collision with a ceiling at $22.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent newsletter, Singapore-based crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital raised the question of whether the introduction of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could lead to price manipulation by institutions, similar to what has happened in the gold market. The bitcoin spot ETF filing by BlackRock and many other institutional giants has created a lot of euphoria in the market, but the manipulation issue has not been addressed much.
 
According to QCP Capital, “Just like BTC, gold is seen as a competitor to the dollar, especially ever since Nixon removed the dollar from the gold standard in 1971. Having full control of gold allows institutions to defend the dollar, especially if they have various vested interests in protecting the greenback.”
