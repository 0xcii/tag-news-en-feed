        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin traders might be upbeat about what lies ahead. However, looking at the daily chart, the world’s most valuable coin is struggling for momentum. BTC prices are inside a narrow range, with support at around $56,000 on the lower end and a stubborn liquidation level at $63,000.
 
Even though the uptrend remains, at least considering the state of price action in the past few trading days, conservative and risk-on traders are now on the sidelines. 
 
It is only when there is a clear trend definition, either below $50,000 or above $72,000, that traders can commit. The result will be an uptick in trading volume, currently muted and way below the averages recorded on August 8.
