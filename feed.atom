        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The price of the BRC20 token ordi (ORDI) slid more than 10% this week against the U.S. dollar after recording substantial gains over the three weeks prior. Despite the recent downturn, ORDI has risen over 300% during the last 30 days and it’s a touch over 25% away from surpassing its all-time price high.
 
ORDI Retreats 10% After 300% Monthly Gain, Sees Significant Trading Activity With Turkish Lira
 
At the end of the first week of November, ordi (ORDI) the BRC20 token built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain skyrocketed in value after Binance announced it would list the coin. This week, however, ORDI has dropped 10% in value over the past seven days and during the last 24 hours, it’s down 2.2%.
 

 
ORDI’s market valuation on November 25, 2023, is just under a half billion at $446 million. This places ORDI in the 115th-ranked position among more than 10,000 crypto assets listed across 935 exchanges. Over the past day, ORDI has recorded $99 million in global trades, and interestingly, statistics from cryptocompare.com show ORDI has a great deal of trades associated with the Turkish lira, and even more so than its USDT pairs.
 
While ORDI is down 2.2% and more than 10% this past week, it has climbed awfully close to the pinnacle price it hit seven months ago on May 08, 2023. At that time, ORDI was trading for $28.52 per coin, and today, it is exchanging hands for $21.04 per unit. Moreover, over the past 30 days, ORDI has climbed 319% against the greenback.
 
 
Wallet or rich list statistics from the top ten ORDI wallets indicate that the crypto exchange Okx is one of the largest holders. The centralized exchange has a vast sum of ORDI tokens in the following addresses “bc1q8,” “bc1qg,” “bc1qz,” “bc1qn,” and “bc1qq,” among others. The largest ORDI holder today is the wallet “bc1qh” which commands 2,231,755 ORDI. The address is not flagged so the owner is unknown.
