Zhao pled guilty on Tuesday in US federal court for violating the Bank Secrecy Act with his crypto exchange business. He is facing a maximum prison time of 8 months and is now awaiting his sentencing.   

Following his guilty plea, Zhao signed a $175-million bond agreement, putting up $15 million in a trust account, and also found guarantors for the additional funds. Although he is now allowed to leave the US, he needs to return to the US two weeks before his sentencing scheduled in February 2024.
