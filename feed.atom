This historic approval, which consolidated proposals from the Nasdaq, NYSE, and CBOE, marked a significant shift in the regulatory landscape of digital assets.
 
Why The SEC Is In ‘Deep Trouble’ With Its Crypto Cases
 
However, this decision comes with its complexities, particularly in light of ongoing legal challenges involving the classification of other cryptocurrencies.

  Compare that to this week’s spot ETH ETF approval, and it’s a very different story. Until the start of this week, the overwhelming expectation was that ETH ETFs were in line for rejection, amid reports that the SEC had not engaged with applicants, and with uncertainty around how ETH was categorized: as a commodity, like BTC, or as a security that was not properly registered.
