But at Ohio State University’s ceremony this past Sunday, the chosen speaker, Chris Pan, delivered a speech that left many scratching their heads and some downright booing.
 
 
Pan, a 1999 graduate and entrepreneur, ignited controversy by admitting on LinkedIn that he wrote the first draft of his speech under the influence of ayahuasca, a powerful psychedelic drug. This revelation was only the beginning of the unusual turn of events.
