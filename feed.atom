Despite these apparent challenges and a somewhat subdued current state, recent findings in a comprehensive report shed light on a more optimistic future for GameFi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Swiss city of Basel recently settled a series of tokenized bonds using a wholesale central bank digital currency (WCBDC) as part of Helvetia III, a WCBDC pilot program. The system is designed to prioritize efficiency, as having on-chain funds bypasses the need for reconciling transactions with a private bank account.
Basel Issues Tokenized Bonds Settled Using a Wholesale CBDC
The city of Basel in Switzerland has achieved a milestone by completing what might be the first regulated settlement of tokenized bonds in a production environment. As part of the Helvetia III wholesale central bank digital currency (WCBDC) pilot program, the city issued a tokenized bond via the Basel Cantonal Bank that was settled using a WCBDC.
The issuance, valued at almost $120 million, was managed by the Swiss National Bank and the SIX digital exchange, the entity in charge of tokenizing the Swiss francs for the transactions. Using on-chain money is said to make these transactions cheaper and more efficient, given that participants don’t have to wait for private bank redemptions in the settlement process.
David Newns, head of SIX digital exchange, praised this development as a new step in modernizing securities markets. He stated:
The settlement of the first securities transactions in WCBDC … represents a major milestone for the entire industry on the road of adoption of a tokenized, DLT based financial markets infrastructure.
The Helvetia III pilot involves six commercial banks and the SIX digital exchange. The next step for this WCBDC is to be used for repo transactions, something that had already been hinted at by the SIX digital exchange in November.
All of these operations use R3’s Corda blockchain platform, with its CEO David Rutter stating the endeavors represent “another key milestone for the wider development of wholesale CBDC and digital assets which will importantly be used in a live production environment.”

When the value of this metric goes up, it means that these chain validators are adding more coins to their supply currently. Such accumulation from this group can naturally positively impact the BTC price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The World Gold Council (WGC) is anticipating a flat demand for the precious metal in the expected case of a “soft landing” scenario. However, the institution states that a recession is still not off the table, given that the U.S. Federal Reserve has managed only to pull off two soft landings in nine tightening cycles.
World Gold Council Examines Gold Demand in Various Scenarios
The World Gold Council (WGC) has released its 2024 Gold Outlook report, which examines the possible behavior of the gold markets for next year. According to the institution, the most likely scenario, expected by the markets due to the prediction of growth ahead, is a U.S. economy “soft landing,” forecasting that the Federal Reserve will be able to lower inflation without setting up a decline in the country’s economy.
Gold would not be favored in this scenario, as investors historically have favored bonds and stocks instead. However, a soft landing, albeit expected, is still not sure to happen. According to the report, a recession is still not off the table, given that seven of nine tightening cycles of the Fed have resulted in recession. The behavior of the labor market will be significant, as its situation has considerably worsened in recent months.
In this context, the WGC predicts a favorable outcome for gold investors, with markets taking a “flight to safety” approach. The report stated:
If a recession becomes a reality, weaker growth will help push inflation back towards central bank targets. Such an environment has historically created a positive environment for high-quality government bonds and gold.
In addition, the geopolitical events happening on the planet, including war, conflicts, elections, and above-trend gold purchases by central banks that have escalated historically during the last two years, might also boost gold’s performance as an investment asset in 2024.
