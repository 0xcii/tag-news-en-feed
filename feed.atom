Following his guilty plea, Zhao signed a $175-million bond agreement, putting up $15 million in a trust account, and also found guarantors for the additional funds. Although he is now allowed to leave the US, he needs to return to the US two weeks before his sentencing scheduled in February 2024.

His statements, made in response to a recent post on X by Senator Elisabeth Warren’s about Binance, shed light on what he describes as systemic corruption within these agencies.
 
Senator Warren’s post drew attention to the guilty plea of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao on breaking anti-money laundering laws, portraying it as part of a wider trend of criminality in the crypto space. She urged the DOJ to probe Binance for alleged deceit towards Congress. This tweet, highlighting the need for stringent regulatory oversight, inadvertently set the stage for Nerayoff’s revelations.

Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Has Plunged Into Negative Zone Recently
 
As CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn explained in a post on X, the BTC net taker volume has recently turned red. The “net taker volume” refers to a metric that keeps track of the difference between the taker buy and taker sell volumes of Bitcoin on the futures market.
 
When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the taker buy volume exceeds the taker sell volume right now. Such a trend implies a bullish mentality is dominant among the investors currently.
 
 
On the other hand, negative values suggest the majority shares a bearish sentiment, as the selling press…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-22T21:15:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Tom Farley, the former President of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and current CEO of Bullish, shared his optimistic outlook on the future of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, upon the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Farley's comments come amidst the ongoing speculation surrounding the SEC's decision on whether to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF, a move that could potentially open the floodgates for institutional investment in the Bitcoin market.
During the interview, Farley emphasized the significance of a spot ETF approval, asserting that it could be a game-changer for Bitcoin. He highlighted the appeal of a spot ETF, which would allow investors to gain direct exposure to the underlying asset, unlike futures-based ETFs currently available in the market.
"Everyone acknowledges Bitcoin is not a security, including the regulators," said Farley. "Money will flood into the industry with a Bitcoin ETF, it's just easy to buy it. People believe in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a great invention. It is a store of value."



Farley, who recently spearheaded Bullish's acquisition of CoinDesk, expressed confidence in Bitcoin's long-term potential, predicting a substantial inflow of capital into the market once a spot ETF receives regulatory approval. He cited the increasing interest among institutional investors and the broader financial community in gaining access to Bitcoin through traditional investment vehicles.
"This guy ran the New York Stock Exchange, he's all in on Bitcoin and crypto now," said co-anchor of CNBC's Squawk Box Joe Kernen. "They use that as credibility for the asset class."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Binance, the world’s leading crypto exchange by trading volume, has experienced a significant withdrawal of approximately $1.7 billion in digital assets, as reported by Nansen, a blockchain analysis company. This substantial outflow of funds from Binance occurred shortly after the settlement. As of the latest update, Binance’s diverse array of digital currencies amounts to a total value of $64.98 billion.
 
Post-DOJ Settlement, Binance Faces $1.7 Billion Crypto Exodus, Nansen Data Reveals
 
In the aftermath of the agreement with the DOJ, Binance has seen a noticeable decrease in its crypto holdings, with Nansen highlighting these movements on Wednesday.
 
Within just a 12-hour window on Wednesday, the exchange reported a decrease of $17 million in ethereum (ETH) and, within a 24-hour timeframe, a staggering $956 million worth of various prominent cryptocurrencies exited Binance.
 
 
By 10:11 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, the total withdrawals from Binance had reached $1.7 billion, according to Nansen.
 
At noon the same day, the exchange’s reserves stood at $64.98 billion. Of this, 28.94% is in tether (USDT), while bitcoin (BTC) constitutes roughly 28.7% of the portfolio. Ethereum (ETH) accounts for 10.13%, trueusd (TUSD) makes up 4.6%, and BNB represents 4.31%.
 
 
The remaining 23.32% of Binance’s reserves is spread across numerous other unnamed cryptocurrencies.
 
Regarding its bitcoin holdings, Binance has 511,438 BTC, and its tether reserves total $18.8 billion. Binance operates the largest BTC wallet by size, currently holding 248,597 BTC. Notably, this wallet has not recorded any outgoing transactions since January 7, 2023.
