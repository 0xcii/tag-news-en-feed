        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While bitcoin (BTC) is already a limited asset, Mike Caldwell’s Casascius physical bitcoins take rarity to a whole new level. Between 2011 and 2013, he endowed over 27,000 coins and bars with nearly 100,000 BTC. As we step into September 2023, a limited supply of 19,082 Casascius physical bitcoins remain in circulation, with around 41,280 BTC yet to be claimed.
 
Just Over 19,000 Casascius Physical Bitcoins Remain Unpeeled
 
In the first eight months of 2023, approximately 162 physical bitcoins designed by Mike Caldwell were cashed in or peeled. These coins represented a total of 386 BTC, translating to near $10 million based on the current BTC exchange rates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency exchange OKX is at the final stretch  
of its virtual asset service provider (VASP) license in Hong Kong. The exchange is  
expecting to receive the approval by March 2023. Hong Kong adopted a pro-crypto  
stance in 2023 but has since been carefully regulating the industry.
In an exclusive  
interview, Li Zhikai, OKX’s Global Chief Commercial Officer, discussed the

Cardano Volume And Social Dominance Are Still At Notable Levels
 
Cardano didn’t have the best of times in August, as the cryptocurrency’s price only saw decline, and so far, September hasn’t proved to be anything different, with the asset continuing to traverse sideways near the same $0.25 low that it had dropped to at the end of last month.
 
Here is a chart that shows the price action ADA has witnessed recently:
 

 
 
From the graph, it’s visible that ADA is currently retesting the same lows that it had during a couple of times last month. These two previous retests had been brief and the asset had found quick rebounds at them.

Market volume was relatively low in today’s session, as a result of the U.S. Labor Day celebration. Ethereum was slightly higher, as the price managed to remain above $1,600. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was trading below $26,000 on Labor Day, as volume in the cryptocurrency market was mostly lower.
 
BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $25,817.03 to start the week, following a high of $26,087.15 the day prior.
 
The decline pushed bitcoin closer to a collision with support at $25,600, however bulls have so far rejected this retracement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, appears to be on shaky ground as it heads into September, historically a challenging month for the digital asset. 
 
The uncertainty stems from a combination of factors, including the latest decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and broader macroeconomic concerns.
 
August concluded with Bitcoin experiencing a setback as it relinquished its gains following the SEC’s decision to delay its ruling on a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). 
 
This regulatory delay has raised questions about the timing of potential mainstream adoption of Bitcoin investment vehicles.
 
 
Experts Weigh In On Bitcoin
 
According to Noelle Acheson, the author of “Crypto is Macro Now,” investors should closely monitor the growing US budget deficit.

In a world where technological progress has sprinted from hard industries to consumer-facing revolutions, it’s now in the hands of service-oriented high-tech sectors like robotics, advanced software, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing.
 
OpenAI’s ChatGPT recently made headlines, reaching 100 million users in just two months, even outpacing TikTok’s adoption rate record of nine months. Yet, challenges faced by crypto, Web3, and blockchain technologies in 2022 prompted the need for fresh perspectives and strategies to clarify and elevate their value proposition to the real economy.
 
The solution? The Hourglass Collective.

Both crypto related events as well as notable macro data are very scarce this week. The most important macro data are the ISM Services PMI (on Wednesday 10:00 am EST) and the initial jobless claims (on Thursday at 8:30 am EST). However, neither event is likely to have a significant impact on the dollar index (DXY) and thus Bitcoin and crypto.
 
Due to this, we are making an exception this Monday and looking at the entire month of September rather than the upcoming seven days in our weekly preview. September holds several extremely important events in store, and could also provide a few surprises.
