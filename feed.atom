This development follows the major court ruling clarifying that XRP, Ripple’s affiliated digital currency, is not considered a security in US.
 
Long expressed her enthusiasm for the clarity the ruling provides. She explained, “It’s been a couple weeks now since the judge’s ruling in our case, providing clarity that XRP is not a security. We’re very happy about it because we now have clarity how Ripple will operate its business going forward. And we are re-engaging with the US market.”
 
However, Ripple’s operational strategy is not solely focused on the US. The firm has experienced significant growth in international markets, particularly where there is clear regulator…]]></summary>

On Wednesday, August 2, Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell tweeted his concerns about the plans to relaunch the FTX exchange. This was in response to another tweet by a former FTX user, agreeing that the exchange relaunch is “unnecessary.”
 
Powell believes that going ahead with the FTX 2.0 plans will be “worse than starting from scratch,” as there is no adequate framework to initiate such a process. He said the exchange has “no team, no tech, no licenses, no banking, and a tarnished brand.”

A recently published report by Grayscale, the world-renowned digital asset manager, places the recovery of the crypto market squarely on the shoulders of the U.S. economy.
 
According to the report, the continuation of this rebound is intrinsically tied to the U.S.’s ability to achieve what economists call a “soft landing.”
 
 
The Role Of The Fed And The Crypto Recovery
 
Macroeconomic factors have emerged as significant risk contributors to the volatile world of cryptocurrency valuations. In this context, the premise of a ‘soft landing’ is linked to the Federal Reserve’s ability to reach its 2% inflation goal without a stark rise in unemployment.
