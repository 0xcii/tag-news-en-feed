        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As cryptocurrencies continue to evolve, two key consensus mechanisms have emerged for validating transactions on the blockchain: proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS). This explainer will examine how these protocols differ and the unique benefits and drawbacks of each.
 
Consensus Mechanisms in Cryptocurrency
 
Proof-of-work (PoW), first introduced by Bitcoin in 2009, requires miners to compete to add new blocks to the blockchain. By expending significant computational power, miners prove that the work was done to validate transactions.
 
 
The first miner to win the race and discover a block is rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency. PoW relies on decentralized consensus – no single entity controls the network. However, its critics consider it incredibly energy-intensive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Onchain evidence reveals that three dormant ‘sleeping bitcoin’ addresses, established in January 2012, have awakened, moving a total of 325.19 bitcoin valued at over $8.6 million after an 11-year hiatus.
 
Vintage Bitcoin Vaults Open: $8.6M Moved From 2012 Dormant Addresses
 
Bitcoin News recently highlighted the staggering $958 million in dormant bitcoin transactions in 2023. Shortly after, around 325.19 bitcoins from January 2012 addresses were mobilized.
 
The initial two transfers (1 & 2) originated from wallets set up over 11 years ago on January 11, 2012. The first address shifted 145.53 BTC, while the subsequent one dispatched 21.97 BTC. Both of these transactions secured confirmation at block height 807,852 and were discovered by btcparser.com.
 
 
In quick succession, the address labeled “1HNnG” executed a transfer of 157.69 BTC, receiving confirmation at block height 807,853. Intriguingly, all three transactions, as per Blockchair’s privacy gauge, lacked advanced privacy measures, rendering them susceptible to transaction scrutiny.
 
Overlapping addresses were pinpointed in these three shifts, indicating repeated address usage. Diving deeper into clustering heuristics and onchain insights, it’s evident that these three transactions likely stemmed from a singular owner. This revelation implies that in 2023 alone, 43 dormant bitcoin addresses from 2012 have been reactivated, moving their vintage coins.
 
 
Moreover, factoring in the recent 325.19 bitcoin transaction from 2012, the year 2023 has witnessed a cumulative transfer of 3,700.97 BTC from this year, translating to a whopping $98.25 million at current BTC exchange rates.
 
When the owner initially secured the coins, each bitcoin had a price tag of $6.36. Back then, the trove’s value was a modest $2,068, a stark contrast to its present worth of $8.6 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin was undoubtedly one of the biggest moves in the top 100, as the token rose by as much as 14% on Saturday. The rise comes as markets continue to react to the news of a recent partnership with Telegram. Shiba inu was also higher, hitting a one-week high.
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin rose by as much 14% on Saturday, as traders continued to react to the partnership with Telegram.
 
Following a low of $1.94 on Saturday, TON/USD raced to an intraday high of $2.23 to start the weekend.
 
This surge in price pushed toncoin to its strongest level since April 27, when the price was trading at a high of $2.37.
 
 
Overall, it appeared that the move came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 71.00.
 
As of writing, the index is now sitting at 72.68, which is deep in overbought territory, and a potential cause for concern for bulls.
 
Should TON continue to climb, a ceiling at $2.35 could be a point where bears look to send prices lower.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) rose to a one-week high to start the weekend, which comes after a five-day bull run.
 
SHIB/USD peaked at $0.000007564 earlier in today’s session, following a low at $0.000007331 the day before.
 
Today’s surge pushed the meme coin to its highest level since last Saturday and comes following a breakout at a ceiling of $0.00000735.
 
 
Earlier gains have since faded, with SHIB now tracking at $0.000007425, which comes as the RSI collided with a hurdle.
 
Price strength failed to move beyond a ceiling at 43.00, and is currently tracking at the 40.97 zone.
 
In the event bulls secure a rally beyond the aforementioned resistance, SHIB will likely edge closer to $0.000008000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many Altcoins are tipped to rise significantly alongside the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, once the bull run begins. In line with this, this crypto analyst has stated the best time to buy these altcoins in preparation for this occurrence.  
 
When’s The Best Time To Invest In Altcoins? 
 
According to the CEO and Founder of trading platform MN Trading, Michaël van de Poppe, the best time to invest in altcoins is “6-10 months prior to the Bitcoin Halving,” which happens to be around this period. The Bitcoin Halving is slated to happen sometime in April next year.
 
Poppe stated on his X (formerly Twitter) platform that this period is the worst of the crypto market cycle but also represents the “best period to invest” as altcoins are “moving massively.”
