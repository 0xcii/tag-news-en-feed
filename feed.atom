        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has granted official approval for spot Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs, signifying a major milestone for the crypto market in the region. 
 
However, while the approval brings excitement, Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas offered a more cautious analysis of the potential inflows into the newly approved market. 
 
Balchunas claims that Hong Kong ETFs are expected to lag significantly behind their US counterparts, which have amassed more than $200 billion in Bitcoin ETFs trading volume since trading began in January.
 
Obstacles For Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs

The Runes Protocol, developed by the mind behind the Ordinal Theory, Casey Rodarmor, is generating buzz as it introduces a new fungible token standard for Bitcoin. 
 
A recent report by crypto analysis firm Delphi Digital sheds light on the potential of Runes to disrupt the tokenization landscape, challenging the dominance of BRC-20s. 
 
A Glimpse Into The Runes Protocol
 
Unlike its predecessors, Runes is not a token itself but rather a framework that enables the creation of altcoins on the Bitcoin Network. Tokens created using the Runes Protocol, aptly named “Runes,” are fungible, meaning each Rune is interchangeable.

Taking to X, Balchunas is warning investors to be especially cautious about expecting a major influx of capital, especially into the spot Bitcoin ETF, as was first witnessed in the United States early this year.
