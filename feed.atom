        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The bankrupt crypto exchange Cryptopia has revealed  
its strategy to return digital assets to select users affected by the infamous  
cyberattack of 2019. Following a prolonged period of uncertainty and  
legal proceedings, the New Zealand-based firm aims to provide relief to those  
impacted by the breach, according to a report by Coindesk.
Crypto Redistribution Plan
Cryptopia faced a devastating blow in 2019 when it  
fell victim to a cyberattack, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in  
tokens. Despite filing for liquidation thereafter, the exchange has announced  
plans to redistribute Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) to qualifying account  
holders.
The pivotal moment arrived with a court ruling on  
March 1, marking progress in Cryptopia's bankruptcy case unfolding in  
Wellington, New Zealand. This ruling paved the way for the exchange's  
decision to initiate the distribution process, offering hope to users awaiting  
the recovery of their lost crypto assets.
Besides the cyberattack, Cryptopia encountered  
further setbacks when a former employee breached the platform's security in  
2021, exacerbating the financial turmoil. Within the next three months,  
eligible users will reportedly receive the first asset distribution, receiving  
Bitcoin and Dogecoin.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Cardano Founder Thinks Solana Has No Real Network Value?
 
The comparison was drawn when an X (formerly Twitter) user (known as Jeremy) stated that SOL had reclaimed $140 and quizzed Hoskinson about when ADA would hit $1. The Cardano founder replied and simply said, “Number goes up != good ecosystem or real network value.”
 
 
However, his statement has caught the eyes of members of the crypto community, as he could have been insinuating that Solana has a good ecosystem but lacks real network value. If so, it won’t be the first time that Hoskinson throws shade at Solana and criticizes th…]]></summary>
