        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin market has been riddled with several whale selloffs since June. The majority of these selloffs have emerged from miners and a few other whales, although recent news has emerged that the German government is also selling off its holdings. 
 
Due to the enormous scale of the transactions, selloffs by the government can be classified as whale movements. Many market participants can also argue that they’ve contributed to an increase in selling pressure and a price decline for Bitcoin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The price of Bitcoin has not made a great start to the third quarter of 2024 after falling to a multi-month low over the past week. Bitcoin spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds), on the other hand, appear to be benefitting from the recent dip in prices, having posted a positive week in terms of capital flow.
 
According to the latest data, a significant amount of capital flowed into the Bitcoin investment products despite the poor performance of the flagship cryptocurrency.
 
$238 Million Flows Into US Bitcoin Spot ETFs In The Past Week
 
On Friday, July 5, Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed a net inflow of more than $143 million, the largest net inflow seen by the market since June 6 — about a month ago. According to data from Coinglass, most of the capital inflow was contributed by Fidelity’s FBTC.…]]></summary>

How USDT’s Dominance Predicts The Top For Bitcoin
 
Thomas claimed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that USDT dominance has predicted every Bitcoin local top for the last six years. He noted that there has always been a clear local top for Bitcoin each time the USDT dominance touches the bottom of a trendline, which the analyst highlighted on the chart. Thomas added that anyone who used this metric would have sold the top every time in the previous cycles.

A Family Affair: From Law Professor To Alleged Straw-Donor Architect
 
Central to the accusations is Joe Bankman, SBF’s father and a Stanford law professor. Emails reportedly detail his involvement in strategizing the alleged scheme, which prosecutors believe constitutes an illegal straw-donor operation.
