        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned an Ethereum wallet used by the Sinaloa Cartel to launder money from fentanyl sales in the U.S. Mario Alberto Jimenez Castro, an accused money launderer for the cartel’s Los Chapitos faction, allegedly directed the use of cryptocurrency and wire transfers to pay cartel leaders in Mexico, according to OFAC.
 
U.S. Treasury Targets Sinaloa Cartel Member’s Ether Wallet in Crackdown on Fentanyl Distribution
 
OFAC said Tuesday it sanctioned ten individuals, including several Sinaloa Cartel affiliates and fugitives, for contributing to the international proliferation of illicit drugs. In addition to sanctioning people, OFAC designated the Ethereum wallet with the address “0x9c2” used by Jimenez Castro.
 
“Jimenez Castro has directed U.S.-based couriers to pick up cash in the United States and deposit it into various virtual currency wallets for payment directly to the Chapitos and for reinvestment in fentanyl production,” OFAC said.
 
The Sinaloa Cartel is considered one of the most powerful drug trafficking groups in Mexico and is a major supplier of fentanyl in the U.S. OFAC said the sanctions target members of Los Chapitos, a faction run by the sons of imprisoned Sinaloa leader Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.
 
 
OFAC said the sanctions demonstrate “the [Biden] Administration’s strengthened approach to saving lives by disrupting the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and its precursors into American communities.”
 
The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets held by the Ethereum wallet and prohibit Americans from conducting transactions with the wallet. OFAC said it will continue targeting foreign drug traffickers contributing to the opioid epidemic through sanctions.

Chase UK to Halt Crypto Payments in Mid-October
 
Chase UK customers are about to hit a roadblock for payments tied to cryptocurrency dealings. The bank’s rationale? A spike in scams and fraud. An email from the institution cautions, “If we think you’re making a payment related to crypto assets, we’ll decline it.”
 
A representative from Chase verified the email’s legitimacy to Bloomberg and shed light on their stance. Coindesk’s Sandali Handagama also reported on the Chase UK email on Tuesday prior to Bloomberg’s confirmation.
 
“We’ve seen an increase in the number of crypto scams targeting U.K. consumers, so we have taken the decision to prevent the purchase of crypto assets on a Chase debit card or by transferring money to a crypto site from a Chase account,” the Chase spokesperson revealed.
 
 
Chase made its move after a series of regulatory overhauls in the United Kingdom within the past six months. For instance, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new guidelines for the crypto industry. Concurrently, the financial powerhouse Paypal has briefly suspended U.K.-based crypto transactions, pointing to these regulatory adjustments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash rose by as much as 5% on Tuesday, as bulls extended recent gains following last week’s consolidation. The token rose for a second consecutive session, moving closer to a resistance level of $225 in the process. BNB also climbed, pushing towards a ceiling of its own at $220.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was a notable gainer in today’s session, as the cryptocurrency climbed for a second straight day.
 
Following a low of $206.86 to start the week, BCH/USD peaked at $213.89 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw bitcoin cash close in on a resistance level of $225, which was last reached on September 18.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average remained above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) has broken out of a ceiling at 52.00, and is now tracking at 54.50.
 
A point of resistance at 60.00 now seems to be the next target for bulls, and if hit, BCH will more than likely be above $225.
 
 
BNB
 
BNB, formerly binance coin, was another big mover on Tuesday, as the token rose for a back-back session.
 
BNB/USD reached a high of $213.19 earlier in the day, after starting the week at a low of $208.02.
 
Overall, the native token of cryptocurrency exchange Binance now seems to be pushing for a ceiling of $220.
