        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bittrex, a bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange platform founded in 2014, has filed for bankruptcy in the state of Delaware. The decision comes after the company previously announced that it would be ceasing all operations in the U.S. effective April 30th as a result of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges against the firm and its former CEO for operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. However, this announcement does not impact Bittrex Global, according to a statement released by the company, which will continue its operations as usual for customers outside of the U.S.
For customers who did not withdraw their funds from the platform prior to the end of April, the company has stated that their funds remain “safe and secure.” While the Bankruptcy Court will ultimately decide the method by which those funds can be claimed by and distributed to customers, the company stated its intentions to activate those accounts as soon as possible so that customers who meet the necessary regulatory requirements can withdraw their funds.
Bittrex has also retained Omni Agent Solutions to provide email and website updates to customers. The company has encouraged affected customers to visit their website during this process, as they will provide additional information as it becomes available, and customers will also receive information directly from the bankruptcy court.
In the released statement, the company said, "Our main priority is to ensure that our customers are made whole. We are committed to working through the bankruptcy process in a way that is transparent and compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience during this time."]]></summary>

to Estonia’s anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financial of  
terrorism (CFT) regulation has  
resulted in a dramatic drop in the number of licensed cryptocurrency service  
providers. As of May 1, 2023, there were only 100 crypto firms with operating  
licenses, which  
is an 80% drop from 489 as of March 15, 2022, when the amended Money  
Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act came into force.
According to the Estonia  
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a total of 389 operating licenses have been withdrawn  
either voluntarily or based on its action. Of this number, nearly 200 were  
withdrawn by the companies while about the same number were revoked by the

"There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>

And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>
