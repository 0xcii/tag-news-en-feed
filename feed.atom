Assange, who is wanted on 18 charges related to the release of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables, will, however, renew his appeal next week according to a report by Reuters. The British High Court ruled that Assange had no legal grounds to challenge the extradition decision.
Previously, a British judge ruled against Assange's extradition, citing concerns about his mental health and the risk of suicide if held in a maximum security prison. However, the decision was overturned on appeal after the U.S. authorities provided assurances, including the possibility of transferring Assange to Australia to serve any sentence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana moved towards the $20.00 mark on Friday, despite reports confirming that Robinhood was set to delist the token from its platform. In addition to solana, cardano and polygon were also removed. XRP also trended higher in today’s session.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) moved close to the $20.00 level on Friday, despite news that Robinhood was removing the token from its platform.
 
According to reports, the removal will occur on June 27. This comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) determined that several tokens on Coinbase and Binance were securities.
 
Following a low of $18.56 on Thursday, SOL/USD moved to an intraday high of $19.30 during today’s session.
 
 
Today’s surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) neared a resistance level of 43.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.14, with SOL at the $19.08 level.
 
Despite earlier gains easing after the reports, SOL remains above yesterday’s low.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, managed to avoid Robinhood’s hit list, surging by over 3% on Friday as a result.
 
XRP/USD jumped to a peak at $0.5324 earlier in today’s session, which comes less than 24 hours after the price bottomed out at $0.5184.
 
Friday’s surge in price led to the token briefly breaking out of a key resistance level of $0.5320.
 
 
This comes as the RSI collided with a ceiling of its own at 64.00, with bears so far rejecting a breakout.
 
Currently, the index is tracking marginally lower at 63.50, with longer-term bulls targeting a higher ceiling at 70.00.
 
Should they reach this point, there is a good chance that XRP will trade close to $0.5800, which was last hit in March.
