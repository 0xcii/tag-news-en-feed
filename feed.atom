A new inscription
A Bitcoin script shone
A light on how it could be done
So on our nodes it was run
Is it on the way out?
What are they about?
It’s not an OP RETURN
Perhaps we can learn.
So it’s a message that you’re making
Like my girl, non-fungible & taken
What is the beast that did awaken
Decentralization can’t be forsaken
Censorship resistant, code is lawless
Immutable bits, they stay flawless
I like physical art so I tango
Some want it on-chain, as if it’s django
See for me, BTC is plenty
Don’t have a need for BRC20
Always current, need more amps
Really, what’s the use for stamps?
