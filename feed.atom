Assumeutxo was merged into the Bitcoin Core master branch by Andrew Chow yesterday. This is the first major non-consensus update to the Bitcoin reference implementation in quite a while, and is going to have a lot of interesting implications for users bootstrapping nodes.

These exchange-traded funds were designed to track futures contracts linked to the value of Ethereum’s native currency, Ether. 
 
However, the initial trading activity suggests that market enthusiasm did not translate into significant investment dollars, especially when compared to the launch of their Bitcoin counterparts.
 
 
Mixed Results For Ether ETFs 
 
Of the nine ETF products introduced, five exclusively hold Ether futures contracts, while the remaining four combine both Bitcoin and ETH futures. While these ETFs entered the market with high expectations, the first day of trading saw relatively subdued volume.

A year ago, Bankman-Fried was living lavishly in a $40

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 2020, applications for liquid staking on the Ethereum blockchain have seen steady growth, and as of the first week of October 2023, a total of 23 liquid staking derivatives (LSD) platforms hold 12.4 million ether, valued at over $20 billion. Currently, the top three LSD protocols hold sway over 11.041 million ETH, accounting for a substantial 89.18% share of the overall ether locked.
 
3 LSDs With 11 Million Ether
 
Roughly a week ago, the number of ethereum (ETH) held by liquid staking derivatives (LSD) protocols surpassed the 12 million mark, with an addition of 370,000 ETH in five days. Essentially, an LSD is a decentralized platform that allows users to stake their ETH in a liquid form, enabling them to maintain flexibility and liquidity while earning rewards simultaneously.

But as Bitcoin starts to regain inflow momentum, Solana has continued to shine, trumping altcoin investment products with inflows of $5 million.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin retreated from a multi-week high on Tuesday, after cryptocurrencies entered overbought territories. Traders have seemingly opted to capture recent profits, ahead of key data points later this week. Ethereum slipped below $1,700.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) edged below the $28,000 level during today’s session, as traders moved to secure Monday’s gains.
 
After surging to a peak of $28,494 to start the month of October, BTC/USD slipped to a low of $27,374 earlier in the day.
 
The decline came after the cryptocurrency climbed to its highest level since August 17, however this momentum was also its downfall.
 
 
This was owing to the fact that Monday’s move pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) above the 70.00 level, and into overbought positions.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 59.93, which is marginally above a support point of 57.00.
 
In the event that this aforementioned floor is broken, there is a good chance that BTC could slip below $27,000 in the coming days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also a victim of today’s profit taking, with price once again falling below the $1,700 mark.
 
ETH/USD sank to a bottom at $1,646.08 on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after peaking at a seven-week high of $1,733.51.
 
The decline appears to have come after ethereum bulls were unable to force a breakout above a ceiling at $1,730.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the sell-off engulfed gains from the past three days, and came as the RSI fell below a floor at 60.00.
 
Currently, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency is trading at $1,656.73, and appears to be heading for a floor at $1,620.

Why Ethereum Could Outperform BTC
 
Beginning with his primary reason, Hougan emphasized the network’s role as a revolutionary global computing platform.

XRP Price Tanks As Whale Sells Big
 
Naturally, when investors start selling their tokens, it has an impact on the price of altcoins such as XRP. And when those sellers are large whales, the impact on the XRP price is orders of magnitudes higher than what it would be if smaller holders were selling.
