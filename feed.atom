Bitcoin Has Now Seen 157 Straight Days Of Net Profit-Taking

The relevant indicator here is the “Net Realized Profit/Loss,” which tracks the net amount of profit or loss (in USD) that Bitcoin investors as a whole are realizing with their selling.
 
 
This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each sold coin to see what price it was moved at before this. Assuming that the last transaction of the coin was the last point at which it changed hands, the price at its time wo…]]></summary>

This formation, which traditionally indicates a potential trend reversal, is forming at a critical point for Bitcoin. 
 
According to Severino, there could be tell-tale signs suggesting that the Bitcoin upswing could end as the momentum fades.
 
The Evening Star Formation: BTC Bull Run Over?
 
Though there are concerns that the pattern is forming on the Bitcoin CME futures chart, it is absent from the spot BTCUSD chart on ordinary charts from Binance or Coinbase, for example. Accordingly, the lack of uniformity on charts has also left Severino questioning the reliability of the signal.

has predicted that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by September,  
thanks to Bitcoin halving. Kiyosaki, famed for his insights on wealth and  
investment strategies, plans to accumulate 10 more Bitcoins before April,  
according to his post on X.
He mentioned: "I am buying 10 more Bitcoin before  
April. Why? The "Having." If you can't afford a whole Bitcoin, you  
may want to consider buying 1/10 of a coin via the new ETFs or Satoshi's. If  
the Bitcoin process works as designed, you may own a whole Bitcoin by the end of  
this year."

The magnitude of these outflows at roughly $942 million is particularly notable, almost doubling the previous record of $500 million witnessed towards the end of January.
 
 
Major players in the asset management space, including BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares, felt the brunt of this wave of withdrawals, according to CoinShares.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 25, 2024
  
  
  
Subject to approval by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the base prospectuses, the Exchange plans to commence trading of these ETNs on Tuesday, May 28, 2024. This move is aimed at ensuring maximum issuer participation on the first trading day and allowing issuers sufficient time to prepare their documentation and meet regulatory requirements.
"We have decided to launch the market in Crypto ETNs on 28 May 2024 to enable the maximum number of issuers to be present in the market on the first day of trading," the notice stated. "In choosing this date we have taken into consideration that we need to ensure that issuers meet the requirements for consideration detailed in the Crypto ETN factsheet and importantly, it will also enable those issuers planning on admitting securities on the launch date, time to prepare documentation to establish a Crypto ETN programme which will require a base prospectus to be approved by the FCA."
Issuers interested in listing securities on the Main Market on May 28 must submit the necessary information to the Exchange by April 15. This includes details on how the issuer and/or the ETN will meet the requirements outlined in the Crypto ETN factsheet and a draft of the base prospectus highlighting relevant disclosures.
However, issuers failing to meet the specified requirements, submit their applications after April 15, or have their base prospectus unapproved by the FCA by midday on May 22, 2024, will not be eligible to participate in the first day of trading.]]></summary>
