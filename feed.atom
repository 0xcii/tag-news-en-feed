        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bank of Japan sent tremors through capital markets as it announced a rate target increase for yield curve control, sending global bond yields soaring.
 
         
         
         
         
     
         
         
         
         
    
On the evening of December 19, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced it had increased its cap on 10-year bond yields from 0.25% to 0.5%, while keeping short- and long-term interest rates unchanged. 



Link to embedded tweet.
The cap at the 0.25% level had been suppressing global bond markets with the use of an unlimited money printer for Japanese debt.

Both parties met that deadline in a timely manner. And the SEC’s filing reveals that it is still not ready to release the Hinman documents to the public.

Jon Cunliffe, the BOE deputy governor for financial stability, has reaffirmed his stance in the need to regulate cryptocurrencies, particularly in the aftermath of FTX’s demise.
 
Cunliffe emphasized the developing ties between the regular banking markets and crypto trading and highlighted the urgency of overseeing crypto before it can undermine the broader financial infrastructure.
