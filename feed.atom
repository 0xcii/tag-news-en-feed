While Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin applauds Worldcoin’s efforts to strengthen privacy measures, Portugal’s data regulator has thrown a wrench into the program by halting biometric data collection for 90 days.
 
 
Worldcoin’s system hinges on a unique approach. Instead of traditional signup methods like name and address, users submit iris scans to create a digital ID.
 
This anonymity is incentivized by offering free WLD cryptocurrency tokens. The program has garnered over 4.6 million users globally, but concerns about data privacy have dogged it from the start.
