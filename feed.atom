        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alliance Bernstein (AB), a prominent $646 billion asset manager, has predicted that the Bitcoin and crypto fund management industry is poised for remarkable growth, potentially reaching a staggering $650 billion within the next five years. 
This forecast comes on the heels of recent developments that have bolstered the outlook for institutional adoption of Bitcoin by Wall Street firms.
AB estimates that the current size of the crypto fund management sector stands at approximately $45-50 billion. However, the firm's analysts argue that this figure has the potential to swell to over $500 billion in assets by 2028. This transformation would signify a transition from what AB dubs a "cottage industry" to a fully formalized, regulated asset management sector.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded from a multi-week low on Tuesday, as markets awaited the latest consumer confidence report in the United States. The latest figures from the Conference Board are expected to show a slight decline, with a reading of 105.9 in September. This will be down from 106.1 the month prior.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was back in the green on Tuesday, as its price rebounded from a multi-week low during yesterday’s session.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $26,421.51 earlier today, which comes following a low of $26,011.47 the day prior.
 
Monday’s low saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency trade at its weakest point since September 13, after dropping below $25,800.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the rebound in price came as a result of the relative strength index (RSI), finding a floor of its own at 45.00.
 
As of writing this, price strength is now tracking at 45.84, with the next visible point of resistance at the 55.00 mark.
 
Should bulls reach the 55.00 level, there is a strong possibility that BTC will move close to the $27,000 zone.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also rose higher on Tuesday, after dropping to a key point of support to start the week.
 
Following a low of $1,565.03 on Monday, ethereum rallied to an intraday high at $1,598.10 less than 24 hours later.
 
Not only did ETH bulls reject a breakout below a floor at $1,565, but also used this as a point of reentry, buying the dip in price.
 
 
Similar to bitcoin above, the surge came as a floor of the RSI also held firm, acting as a springboard for traders.
 
ETH continues to hover below the $1,600 level, however, this could change following this afternoon’s consumer confidence report.

Renewed  
Plea: Bankman-Fried's Latest Bid for Release
The journey towards this request began in August when  
Bankman-Fried's release on bond was revoked. He was incarcerated after a judge  
ruled that he had likely attempted to tamper with witnesses. On September 12,  
his request to overturn this decision was denied, and the appeal to reverse the  
ruling was met with rejection on September 21.
In their latest plea, Bankman-Fried's lawyers noted that the
