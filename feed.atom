        <updated>2024-01-16T17:42:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Market insights reveal that on January 15, 2024, the stablecoin TUSD deviated from its usual $1 parity, dipping to $0.979 per coin the next day. By 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Tuesday, it managed to recover slightly, climbing above the $0.99 mark.
 
TUSD Faces Unsteady Ground, Drops Under $1
 
Recently, TUSD experienced fluctuations, slipping below its $1 benchmark on Monday. That evening, its value lingered around $0.98, amid challenges linked to the company’s real-time attestations. As of January 16, 2024, TUSD’s circulating supply, as displayed on their website, stands at 1.92 billion tokens.
 

 
A significant portion of TUSD’s supply is in the hands of Binance, which owns the top five ERC20 wallets. Of the total supply, only 391.99 million TUSD tokens are issued on the Ethereum blockchain, while 1.48 billion are on the Tron network. Binance’s cold wallet holds approximately 1.4 billion of these tokens.
 
At 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, TUSD temporarily reached $0.996 per coin. Yet, by 10:20 a.m., it fell to about $0.987. This instability has sparked considerable debate on social media, with many questioning the reasons behind TUSD’s fluctuating peg. Most of the trading activity for the coin is concentrated on Binance, with a significant portion of its volume originating from this exchange.
 
 
In the last 24 hours, TUSD’s global trade volume hit $425 million. Despite a hefty supply of 1.92 billion TUSD, its market valuation on Tuesday was slightly lower, at $1.89 billion. TUSD is now among several stablecoins that have dealt with parity issues, a trend that began with the Terra blockchain ecosystem’s collapse in May 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)  
is gearing up for the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation  
(MiCA). This regulation marks an important step in ushering in a new era of  
oversight for digital assets.
As ESMA gears up for the implementation of the MiCA  
regulation, the regulator has established a comprehensive plan to tackle  
crypto-related risks and establish a regulatory framework for the digital asset  
space. However, the watchdog has warned that the MiCA regulation is not a  
foolproof safe haven for investors.
MiCA, effective from June 2023, brings with it  
several measures in its three levels of implementation, spanning within a  
timeframe of 12 to 18 months. ESMA, working closely with EBA, EIOPA, and the  
ECB, engages in a public con…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fourth Bitcoin halving is almost upon us, and this one has the potential for some very interesting surprises. This halving marks the reduction of the Bitcoin supply subsidy from 6.25 BTC every block to 3.125 BTC per block. These supply reductions occur every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, as part of Bitcoin’s gradual, disinflationary approach to its final capped supply in circulation. 
The finite supply of 21 million coins is a, if not the, foundational characteristic of Bitcoin. This predictability of supply and inflation rate has been at the heart of what has driven demand and belief in bitcoin as a superior form of money. The regular supply halving is the mechanism by which that finite supply is ultimately enacted.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, exchange deposits and withdrawals on the Bitcoin blockchain have recently continued to increase.
 
The relevant indicator here is the “Exchange Flow Volume,” which keeps track of the combined amount of volume flowing into the wallets of all centralized exchanges (that is, the inflows) and that moving out of these platforms (the outflows).

guidelines on money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risk factors  
to crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). This initiative is significant in the EU's ongoing battle against illicit financial  
activities. As crypto-assets become increasingly susceptible to misuse for  
criminal purposes, the EBA's guidelines aim to equip CASPs with the knowledge  
and tools to identify and effectively mitigate these risks.
The EBA's guidelines shed light on the risks CASPs face, emphasizing factors such as the rapid crypto-asset transfers  
and features that conceal user identities. These risks necessitate a  
comprehensive understanding, prompting the EBA to provide a list  
of factors indicating exposure levels to ML and TF risks.

And it’s this pursuit that keeps the network secure. Basic vanilla mining involves producing blocks to earn the block rewards and transaction fees, but have you ever considered that miners might have other ways to extract value from the blockchain beyond this standard mining process? Are there other avenues for profit on the blockchain where miners can leverage their unique position as validators?
