        <link href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-reaches-4-billion-settlement-us-sec/"/>
        <updated>2024-06-12T18:16:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Terraform Labs, the company at the center of a significant collapse in 2022, has agreed to pay a substantial settlement of $4.47 billion to resolve a civil lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
 
This legal action was undertaken following the collapse, which resulted in the loss of $40 billion in investor assets and sent shockwaves throughout the cryptocurrency industry.
 
Terraform Labs And Do Kwon Liable For Collapse
 
The SEC recently sought approval from a federal judge in New York for the settlement with Terraform. The agreement was reached subsequent to a jury finding the company and its co-founder, Do Kwon, liable for the collapse after a two-week trial.
 
 
According to the settlement filing, “Payment of the monetary remedies against Kwon shall be deemed satisfied, provided that all transfers by Kwon to the SEC and the Terraform bankruptcy estate in the Bankruptcy Case total no less than $204,320,196. Transferring into an escrow account agreed by Kwon and the Commission staff $4,700,000 within 30 days of Final Judgment.”
 
Victory For SEC
 
The SEC’s allegations against Terraform Labs and Kwon state that from at least April 2018 through May 2022, Terraform and Kwon offered and sold crypto asset “securities in unregistered transactions” and perpetrated a fraudulent scheme that led to the loss of at least $40 billion of market value.
 
Additionally, regulators alleged the defendants misled investors about TerraUSD’s stability, falsely claiming Terraform’s blockchain was integrated into popular Korean mobile payment apps.
 
 
Ultimately, this development represents a victory for the US SEC, as Terraform Labs and its founder Do Kwon, who is facing extradition to the US, had previously proposed civil penalties of up to $3.5 million, with Do Kwon requesting a penalty of $800,000. 
 
 
As of this writing, the company’s Luna Classic (LUNC) token is trading at $0.0001076, up nearly 8% in the 24-hour time frame.

Decker did not mince words when describing the challenges developers face. "We have been trying way too long to be clever in as much that we try to sidestep the discussion of whether we want covenants, what kind of covenants we want, or introspection, as we like to call it," he said.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 12, 2024
  
  
  
The bank's investment app, Ion, now allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum after initially offering crypto trading to only select clients in December 2023.
In an interview, Itaú digital assets head Guto Antunes said the move followed weekly surveys, with initial users showing strong demand for Bitcoin and crypto services. 
While not disclosing user numbers, Antunes said the Ion app has surpassed 3.5 million downloads, which is significant interest for Bitcoin and crypto in Brazil.
The bank opted to build its custody solution for clients' wallets rather than using third parties. Each user gets a separate wallet to ensure asset segregation.
As Brazil's largest bank with extensive reach, opening Bitcoin access will boost mainstream adoption. With Bitcoin's popularity in Brazil, the bank aims to be their preferred gateway into this new asset class.
The embrace of Bitcoin and crypto by a conservatively regulated institution like Itaú also further validates Bitcoin as an investable innovation that is here to stay. More banks in the region may follow suit.
For bitcoiners in Brazil, buying and selling through their existing bank provides accessibility and removes adoption hurdles. Itaú opening the floodgates marks a milestone in Bitcoin's financial mainstreaming in a major Latin American economy.]]></summary>
