In a letter addressed to US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, a coalition of pro-crypto lawmakers, including House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry and Senator Cynthia Lummis, has urged the SEC to rescind its accounting rule for digital assets, known as Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121).
 
Criticism Mounts Against SEC’s SAB 121
 
The letter, issued on Monday and endorsed by forty-two other key members of the House and Senate, emphasizes that Congress has expressed “overwhelming” bipartisan support for disapproval of SAB 121 through the passage of H.J.Res.109. …]]></summary>

Following a recent congressional hearing where Gensler faced intense questioning about his regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, Cuban took to social media to express his dissatisfaction.
 
He referred to Gensler as a “blight” on the tech scene and speculated that US Vice President Kamala Harris might very definitely replace him should she win the presidency.

 So, how can these worlds–the orthodox and the blockchain-built alternative–possibly align? That remains to be seen, but recent news of the formation of a new organization called the MiCA Crypto Alliance is an example of differing approaches crossing and perhaps clashing.
