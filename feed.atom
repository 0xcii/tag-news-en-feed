        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent price action indicates that Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently underperforming compared to other major cryptocurrencies. Over the past seven days, SHIB has experienced a significant decline of 7.26%, and in just the last 24 hours, the token has fallen by an additional 2.58%. This downturn is particularly noteworthy when compared with the performance of Dogecoin (DOGE), its meme coin counterpart. Unlike SHIB, Dogecoin has enjoyed a robust 12% increase over the same seven-day time frame. 
 
One key factor contributing to SHIB’s recent struggles is a noticeable decline in several crucial Shibarium metrics over the past 24 hours. Shibarium, the L2 blockchain network associated with Shiba Inu, has seen a drop in user engagement, transaction volume, and other important indicators, which has li…]]></summary>
