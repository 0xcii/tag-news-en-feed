Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Has Continued Its Downtrend Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, investors have continued to move their coins to self-custody recently. The “supply on exchanges” is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total Bitcoin supply that’s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric rises, it means that a net number of coins are entering these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons why an investor may deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the asset…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[China in recent years has taken a firm stance against cryptocurrencies, imposing stringent regulations and bans to mitigate potential risks associated with the decentralized nature of these digital assets. 
 
However, the tides may be turning as Hong Kong, a prominent financial hub, undergoes regulatory developments that suggest a more permissive attitude towards cryptocurrencies. Simultaneously, mainland China continues to forge ahead with technological advancements, particularly in the realm of blockchain and digital payment systems. 
 
These concurrent developments raise the question: Is China on the verge of lifting its crypto ban and embracing the transformative potential of digital currencies?

I’m aware that Bitcoin has become of great interest to many investors. But despite growing enthusiasm, sharp price volatility continues to worry and confuse many less-experienced investors.
A key way that I believe can help these investors beat their issues with bitcoin volatility is to begin following the principles of Bitcoin Maximalists. Below, I’ve highlighted my key takeaways from this philosophy that I think can help more investors find the right path.
Bitcoin Maxis Invest In What They Understand

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below a key resistance level on Wednesday, as markets prepare for the upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision. It is expected that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged at 5.25%. Ethereum remained below $1,800 in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin traded below a key price ceiling in today’s session, as traders began to anticipate this afternoon’s U.S. Federal Reserve rate decision.
 
BTC/USD dropped to a bottom at $25,728.37 earlier in the day, which comes less than a day after trading at a high of $26,376.35.
 
Today’s low comes as BTC bulls were unable to sustain a breakout above the aforementioned resistance of $26,300.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, the relative strength index (RSI) of 14 days is also hovering around a ceiling of its own at 43.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 42.56, with BTC attempting to break into the $26,000 mark.
 
Should bulls manage to move beyond the obstacle on the RSI, there is a strong chance that price will climb past $26,300 with relative ease.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was largely consolidating on Tuesday, after nearing a breakout below $1,700 earlier in the week.
 
Following a high of $1,761.96 yesterday, ETH/USD slipped to an intraday low of $1,727.75 on Wednesday.
 
As a result of the decline, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moved below a floor at $1,730.

Bulls have since stabilized this support zone, which came as the RSI found its own floor at 38.00.
 
Price strength is now at 38.81, which is within the oversold region, and a possible positive for bulls looking to buy low.

These assets were recently categorized as securities by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following lawsuits against major cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance. 
 
While eToro has not explicitly cited the SEC’s actions as the direct cause for these changes, the platform has emphasized the “rapidly evolving regulatory landscape” as a key factor. 
 
This move aligns eToro with other industry players such as Robinhood, as they navigate the increasing scrutiny and enforcement efforts by the SEC.
