Founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Bankrupt FTX Trading Ltd, Sam Bankman-Fried may be in hot water, as investigations have found multiple pieces of evidence that could potentially be used to convict the ex-FTX CEO. 
 
In a recent court trial, United States District Judge, Lewis A. Kaplan accepted evidential documents including a memo written by Bankman-Fried and multiple audio clips recorded in a Hong Kong November meeting of all Alameda Research employees including former CEO and ex-girlfriend of Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison.

Bitcoin is not simply a new monetary tool, a new currency, or an additional asset class. I tell people that Bitcoin is a Monetary Revolution. The Bitcoin eco-system is full of innovations to bring value beyond simply price growth to new all-time-highs. You can say that the value proposition is built on the foundations of the ever-expanding benefits of the wonder-currency. 
After my failed attempt to first invest in Bitcoin in early 2010, I found myself traveling and working in the Middle East, and Egypt in particular, later that year. Inadvertently, the events of the Arab Spring in the region showed me how today the Social Layer of Bitcoin can be a powerful tool supporting Bitcoin adoption.

        <updated>2023-10-19T15:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana snapped a two-day losing streak on Thursday, as bulls pushed price back towards the $25.00 level. The cryptocurrency was unable to move past this level on Monday, which then prompted the aforementioned sell-off. Cosmos continued to edge lower today, falling to its lowest level in 16 months.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was a big mover in today’s session, after rebounding from two days of consecutive declines.
 
SOL/USD rose to a high at $24.40 on Thursday, which comes a day after the price fell to a bottom of $23.26.
 
As a result of today’s surge, the world’s seventh largest cryptocurrency climbed closer to a long-term ceiling at $25.00.
 
 
The token failed to break out of this level to start the week, which then resulted in the sell-off seen on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
In order to truly move beyond this wall, solana traders will first need to add some distance from a current ceiling of 65.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 65.06, however bulls may be tentative to enter, until the index moves closer to 66.00, 67.00.
 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
On the other hand, cosmos (ATOM) fell to its lowest point in over a year, following a three-day decline in its price.
 
After trading at a high of $6.36, ATOM/USD plunged to a bottom at $6.19 earlier today.
 
This is the lowest level cosmos has reached since mid-June 2022, when price fell to a low at $5.84.
 
 
Earlier declines have somewhat eased, as cosmos remained above a floor of its own at the 30.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is hovering above this level, however is still significantly oversold.

In an era where the way bitcoins are stored and managed becomes crucial, Onramp brings an innovative solution that promises to set a new standard in the industry.
Traditional bitcoin storage methods have posed a significant dilemma for both institutions and individual investors. While some prefer the self-custody approach due to its direct control, many are wary of its technical complexities and potential security issues. On the other hand, centralized custodial options come with their own set of risks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin edged slightly higher on Thursday, following comments from the Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler. Gensler said the commission was currently reviewing eight to ten applications from firms looking to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded-fund (ETF).
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin snapped a two-day losing streak on Thursday, as markets reacted to comments on spot bitcoin ETFs from SEC Chair Gensler.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $28,566.75 on the news, following a low of $28,174.25 during Wednesday’s session.
 
Today’s move comes as bitcoin bulls pushed price back above a recent floor at the $28,200 level.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the bounce comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) jumped at a support point of its own at 63.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 64.35, which is marginally below the next point of resistance at 65.00.
 
In order for bullish momentum to intensify, this ceiling will first need to be broken in the coming hours or days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) on the other hand, fell for a third straight session, as the cryptocurrency collided with a long-term floor.
 
After hitting a high at $1,580.26 on Wednesday, ETH/USD plunged to an intraday low of $1,543.59 earlier today.
 
The move saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency close in on a support point at the $1,540 mark.
 
 
This comes as the 10-day (red) moving average continued to trend lower, and extend its downward cross with the 25-day (blue) trend line.
 
The last time bears forced a breakout below the aforementioned floor, ethereum went on to fall to a seven-month low.
