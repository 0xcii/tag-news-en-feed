Martinez mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal on the Dogecoin daily chart. This indicates that the meme coin could experience an “upswing of one to four days,” the analyst claimed. In a subsequent X post, Martinez offered a more bullish outlook for DOGE, suggesting that the upward trend could last longer.

Economist Peter Schiff threw gasoline on the fire by criticizing Bitcoin’s viability as a currency due to rising transaction fees and sluggish processing times.
 
However, the cryptocurrency community swiftly countered his claims, highlighting potential inaccuracies and offering alternative interpretations.
 
 
Schiff, a vocal Bitcoin skeptic, took to social media platform X to express his concerns. He claimed that a single BTC transaction now costs a staggering $128 and takes over an hour to process – a significant bottleneck for any potential widespread adoption as a medium of exchange.
