        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CleanSpark, Inc., a publicly traded bitcoin mining company, has released its May 2023 bitcoin mining and operations update, revealing significant growth in both its bitcoin holdings and revenue. The company's bitcoin holdings grew by 44% in May, reaching a total of 451 BTC. Bitcoin mined during the month increased by 16% to 609 BTC. 
CleanSpark's CEO, Zach Bradford, expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, stating, "Not only do we continue to increase the amount of bitcoin in our treasury, but we also surpassed $100 million in revenue for our fiscal year to date."
Bradford also attributed the higher-than-expected bitcoin production to increased operational efficiency and a temporary surge in transaction fees due to increased interest in Ordinals on the blockchain. During this period, CleanSpark's daily bitcoin production reached nearly 30 BTC, almost double its normal daily production.
In terms of operational updates, CleanSpark's 50MW expansion in Washington is progressing according to plan, with the facility expected to be fully operational by the end of June. The company's Sandersville site expansion is also underway, with preparations being made for the addition of over 6 EH/s to CleanSpark's mining operations.
To fund its growth and operations, CleanSpark sold 471 bitcoins in May, generating approximately $12.9 million in proceeds. The company currently operates a fleet of about 67,196 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a total hashrate of 6.7 EH/s.
CleanSpark described its commitment to expanding its bitcoin mining capacity and capitalizing on market opportunities. The company stated that with its strong performance and increasing bitcoin holdings, it remains well-positioned for future growth in the industry.]]></summary>

The move aims to enhance transaction speeds and improve interoperability within the blockchain ecosystem. Circle has scheduled the launch of the new native version of USD Coin for June 8. 
 
Transitioning to a Native USDC on Arbitrum
 
In an official blog post, Circle outlined its plan to replace the existing version of USD Coin, which is currently an Ethereum-based token bridged to Arbitrum.
 
 
The new native token will operate directly on the Arbitrum network and will become the official version of USDC within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This transition will eventually phase out the bridged version of USDC originating from Ethereum.

But amidst this significant decline in profitability, a mining company, ClarkSpark, defies the trend by aggressively expanding its mining machine fleet this year. This shows that profitability issues are not holding back mining companies.
 
 
The firm revealed its latest move on June 1, purchasing 12,500 brand-new Antminer S19 XP units for a staggering $40.5 million. 
 
Notably, the deal was secured at a remarkable rate of $23 per terahash per second (TH/s), significantly lower than the present average market price.

These tokens are brought into supply based on the demand and growth in the market, and sometimes not all of the tokens are utilized, which means the unused coins go back into escrow. This was the case this time around as only 10% of the entire 1 billion unloc…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-02T15:44:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano ended a four-day losing streak on Friday, as markets responded to the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report. Payrolls in May rose to 339,000, which was significantly higher than the expected sum of 190,000. Solana collided with a key resistance level in today’s session.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 

 
Cardano (ADA) was one of Friday’s notable gainers, as the token snapped a key resistance level.
 

 
ADA/USD rose by as much as 3% in today’s session, hitting an intraday high of $0.3777 as a result.
 

 
This rally resulted in the 10-day (red) moving average crossing over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 

 

 

 
Typically such an upwards crossover signals the start of a bull run, and it comes as the relative strength index (RSI) also rose considerably.
 

 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 50.91, which is marginally below a resistance level at 52.00.
 

 
In the event this ceiling is broken, there is a strong chance that ADA will move towards the $0.3800 mark.
 

 

 
Solana (SOL)
 

 
Solana (SOL) also climbed higher in today’s session, with prices colliding with a key resistance level in the process.
 

 
Following a low of $20.38 on Thursday, SOL/USD surged to a peak at $21.30 earlier in the day.
 

 
Since hitting the aforementioned ceiling at $21.30, momentum has somewhat weakened, due to bulls securing earlier gains.
 

 

 

 
Another reason for this is that the RSI is close to a resistance level of its own at 55.00, leading traders to act more tentatively.
 

 
The index is currently tracking at 53.64, and should it eventually cross the hard line at 55.00, bullish pressure will likely increase.
 

 
Some may expect this to happen over the weekend, as traders continue to digest today’s economic data.
