        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a post on X from August 25, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has announced its intention to establish a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The announcement was detailed by Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, Lucie (@LucieSHIB).
 
The Vision For A Shiba Inu DAO
 
Lucie emphasized that Shiba Inu currently stands as the 13th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a testament to its dramatic rise since its inception in 2020 by the enigmatic founder known only as Ryoshi. Initially conceived as a token without a predefined purpose, Shib was designed to explore the possibilities of a fully community-driven cryptocurrency. Ryoshi‘s relinquishing of control by burning the keys to the token’s supply marked a pivotal moment, entrusting the project to Shytoshi Kusama and a team of volunteers.

In a blog post, Buterin warned against political attacks on encrypted messaging, centralized identity systems, and insecure operating systems, and growing power of a few social media platforms and dominant countries to censor and deplatform people all around the world.
 
Encrypted Messaging Under Attack
 
Buterin’s first concern is that political attacks on encrypted messaging are picking up steam.

Despite these gains among widespread altcoins, Bitcoin continues to exert dominance over the entire market.
