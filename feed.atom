Binance’s Bitcoin Liabilities In Proof-Of-Reserves Report Are Consistent With On-Chain Data
 
The Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) here refers to the public proof that an exchange has backed its customers’ entire deposits with proper collateralization. Since the collapse of FTX, distrust around centralized platforms has grown among investors in the cryptocurrency market, and they have been demanding for exchanges to release PoR reports.
 
Around a week ago, Binance, the largest exchange by trading volume, revealed its PoR audit report by Mazars, but it was met with scrutiny by some analysts for a few reasons. One of the major points of criticism was that the crypto exchange had th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The futures ETF will be the first of its kind available in Asia according to the asset manager, CSOP.
Investors in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be able to trade the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066.HK) starting December 16 according to a press release. The ETF will track the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin ETFs through active investment. It has received approximately $53 million in initial investments at a listing price of $1 (HKD 7.75).
The approval of the ETFs has both positive and negative connotations — while it signals acceptance amongst traditional finance in the Asian markets, it is not truly bitcoin in the sense that one cannot exchange the ETF shares for real bitcoin, nor is the ETF itself backed by a reserve of actual bitcoin. There are claims that such “paper bitcoin” can suppress the price of real bitcoin through diversion of demand. 

The first bitcoin futures ETF approved in America, the NYSE-listed ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, launched in October of 2021, with $1 billion in trading volume on its first day. Per the release, “In view of the increasing market acceptance of virtual assets, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission announced to allow the launch of ETFs tracking crypto futures for public offering on 31 October 2022, marking the first time Asian retail investors can get this type of exposure to virtual assets.”]]></summary>

This is an opinion editorial by Will Szamosszegi, founder and CEO of bitcoin mining hosting service Sazmining.
Money and energy are two of the most fundamental aspects of an economy because both are universal. Energy is required to transform raw materials into final consumer goods and services. Money is required to store wealth, calculate revenue and losses and trade for goods and services that you couldn't acquire through barter. 
Although Bitcoin drastically improves humanity's relationship with both energy and money, the problems that plague both energy and money are likely to survive a Bitcoin standard, even if they become lesser in severity. With …]]></summary>

Two days ago, another signature and message associated with an old bitcoin address were published, and this time around it was revealed by the ‘pharma bro’ and former hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli. The latest message makes a bold claim that says that criminal cartel boss and former programmer, Paul Le Roux, sent Hal Finney the first bitcoin transaction on Jan. 12, 2009.
