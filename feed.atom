        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently sat down to chat about how the XRP Ledger is enabling a revolution in the tokenization of real-world assets. While speaking in a recent interview, Schwartz noted his excitement around the XRP ecosystem graduating from the investors’ obsession with the XRP token to a more generalized interest in the functionalities of the XRP Ledger. 
 
According to the CTO, the institutional adoption of the XRP Ledger’s technology is also growing in its use in enterprise and financial applications.

This development comes following the heavy criticism of the wider tech community on the board’s decision to abruptly fire the Worldcoin founder.
 
In a shocking statement on Friday, OpenAI announced Altman would be leaving the company, citing a loss of confidence caused by a lack of honesty in the CEO’s exchanges with the board. 
 
This dismissal was ill-received by many within and outside the OpenAI community. Greg Brockman, the company’s president, was the first to resign in reaction to the board’s decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greenidge Generation Holdings has successfully wiped out $21.8 million in secured debt and divested its South Carolina bitcoin mining facility to NYDIG. The firm detailed that the move enhances Greenidge’s financial stability and liquidity.
 
Greenidge Generation Holdings Clears $21.8 Million Debt, Sells Mining Site to NYDIG
 
On Wednesday, Greenidge finalized the sale of a 22-acre mining site with 44 megawatts (MW) of capacity in Spartanburg, SC, to NYDIG. This deal marks the resolution of all outstanding secured debts Greenidge owed to the bitcoin asset management firm.
 
In 2023, Greenidge achieved a reduction in its financial obligations, slashing $85.3 million from its debt. This substantial repayment accounts for more than half — specifically, over 54% — of its total debt.
 
However, the company continues to manage $72 million in unsecured debt, due in 2026. The agreement entitles Greenidge to an approximate $6.2 million cash payout. Moreover, the company retains around 153 acres in Spartanburg, earmarked for potential expansion into data centers.
 
NYDIG, operating under the umbrella of Stone Ridge Holdings Group, provides a spectrum of services including bitcoin (BTC) custody, financial solutions, infrastructure, and BTC mining operations. Acquiring this facility allows NYDIG to further integrate its mining operations with enhanced infrastructure.
 
 
Over the last two years, several cryptocurrency miners incurred substantial debts to NYDIG due to loans taken out to support their mining ventures. These loans were secured during a bullish market period, characterized by high profitability.
 
Nonetheless, the transition to a bear market posed challenges for some of these miners in repaying their debts. Companies including Core Scientific and Iris Energy are among those that held rig-backed loans from the firm.

        <updated>2023-11-19T08:10:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on a recent report, Jump Trading Group, known for its focus on algorithmic and high-frequency trading techniques, has reportedly severed ties with the Wormhole crypto initiative, known for its cross-chain communication services. Last year saw Wormhole suffer a significant loss of 120,000 ethereum due to a major security incident.
 
Wormhole and Jump Trading ‘Part Ways’
 
Recent developments indicate that Jump Trading and Wormhole have “parted ways,” as per a Bloomberg article quoting “people with knowledge of the matter.” The account further reveals that former Jump executives Saeed Badreg and Anthony Ramirez have allegedly departed to manage Wormhole independently.
 
Confidential informants, preferring anonymity, have disclosed that following this division, Jump’s workforce has been reduced to about 75 staffers, which is nearly half of what it was at its peak in 2022. In February 2022, Wormhole suffered a major breach and lost 120,000 ether from the exploit.
 
Following the incident, Jump stepped in and replaced the $320 million worth of ether that was stolen. “All funds have been restored and Wormhole is back up,” the team said at the time. “We’re deeply grateful for your support and thank you for your patience. The team is working on a detailed incident report and will share it ASAP.”
 
 
Based on data from dappradar.com, Wormhole has processed transactions totaling $230.48 million over a 30-day period, spanning seven distinct blockchains. Although unnamed informants have disclosed the information, Jump has yet to make a public statement on the issue.

That same model is now pointing to a peak range near $732,000 per coin. Is this a realistic estimate, or pure hope? Let’s take a closer look at the model and find out.
 
Predicting The Last Bull Market Peak Years In Advance
 
Back in 2019, the go to model for predicting future Bitcoin pricing was Plan B’s now debunked Stock-To-Flow (S2F) model. But around the same time, Greg Cipolaro took a stab at modifying the S2F model with highly accurate results.
 
While Plan B’s take failed to bring the price per BTC above the projected $100,000 or more, Cipolaro’s model nailed a peak range near $60,000.
