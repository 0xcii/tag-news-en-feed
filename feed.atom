DOGE experienced a brief surge following a cryptic post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk last week, which appeared to allude to the token, albeit in an indirect way.
 
Despite this temporary rally, the underlying market sentiment toward Dogecoin remains largely unchanged. The reaction to Musk’s post has not been enough to inspire lasting optimism, particularly among major investors. In fact, large holders have been offloading their positions at a noticeable rate alongside an increase of DOGE inflows to cryptocurrency exchanges.
