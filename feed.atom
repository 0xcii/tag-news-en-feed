        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nigerian crypto community faces uncertainty after  
KuCoin, a prominent global cryptocurrency exchange, announced a new tax policy.  
Starting July 8, the cryptocurrency exchange will impose a 7.5% value-added tax (VAT) on transaction  
fees for users with Know Your Customer (KYC) information registered in Nigeria.
KuCoin Introduces VAT for Nigerian Users
In a post on X, KuCoin informed its Nigerian users  
that the new tax only applies to the fee charged per transaction and not the  
overall transaction amount. For instance, buying 1,000 USDT worth of Bitcoin  
incurs a fee of 1 USDT (0.1%), and the VAT on this fee would be 0.075 USDT,  
making the net transaction amount 998.925 USDT.

Rispoli noted a recent filing case, specifically Ripple’s Notice of Supplemental Authority regarding the recent Binance decision by the US District Court for the District of Columbia.
 
The court’s decision in the Binance case on June 28, 2024, ruled that the SEC had not adequately demonstrated that secondary market transactions of BNB tokens constituted securities transactions. This is particularly relevant for Ripple, as it draws a parallel to its own legal challenges.
