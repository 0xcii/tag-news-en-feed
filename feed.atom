University will return millions of dollars it received from FTX and its affiliated  
entities. This move comes amidst a lawsuit filed by the advisors of FTX, who  
seek to recover funds owed to customers of the bankrupt crypto exchange. FTX  
alleges that the parents of its Co-Founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried,  
enriched themselves with millions of dollars through their influence over FTX.
Allan Joseph  
Bankman and Barbara Fried, who are legal scholars and professors at Stanford  
Law School, have found themselves at the centre of this controversy. The  
lawsuit claims that Stanford University received gifts worth approximately $5.5  
million from FTX-related entities between November 2021 and May 2022.

In July a bitcoin-related topic was broached by Robert Kennedy Jr., which to my knowledge has not been addressed by anyone holding the top office of the executive branch or a notable candidate for the position of President. Of course, John Nash’s Ideal Money is a perennial topic, one I have explored conversationally in the past. It can be a controversial and divisive position, just like other opinions RFK Jr. holds, with a few proponents endorsing even more radical thoughts than the common consensus. How meta…
But to contextualize the totality of what RFK Jr. said regarding a Bitcoin-backed dollar requires us to do a little homework. Luckily, Bitcoin Magazine’s Editor-in-Chief Mark Goodwin has done a lot of the informational legwork for us in a piece …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to David Hirsch, head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, more enforcement actions against firms that haven’t properly registered with the regulator are expected. Hirsch discussed crypto assets and exchanges Tuesday at an SEC forum in Chicago.
 
SEC Crypto Head Forewarns Tougher Enforcement
 
While the crypto community has focused on the XRP case and lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may target more violators soon. David Hirsch, head of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, made the statements, as reported by Coindesk.
 
On Tuesday at the Securities Enforcement Forum Central in Chicago, Hirsch said the SEC will “continue to bring those charges.”
 
“We’re going to continue to be active as to intermediaries,” Hirsch told the audience. “That can be brokers, dealers, exchanges, clearing agencies or any others who are active in this space, are within our jurisdiction and not meeting their obligations, either through registration or failure to provide adequate or complete disclosures.”
 
 
The SEC has cracked down on several high-profile crypto companies such as Binance, Bittrex US, and Coinbase. More recently it has been focused on a couple of non-fungible token (NFT) projects that raised millions without disclosure.
 
Hirsch insists more enforcement is coming. “We’re going to continue to conduct investigations, we’re gonna be active in the space, and adding the label of [decentralized finance] is not going to be something that’s going to deter us from continuing our work,” the SEC official remarked.
 
The SEC official noted the regulator has significant ongoing litigation. Beyond enforcement actions against exchanges and brokers, the market capitalization of crypto coins that the SEC claims are crypto securities stands at $85.4 billion.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xrp-matic-move-to-multi-week-highs-on-wednesday/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-20T15:42:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was a big mover on Wednesday, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly consolidating in today’s session. Traders have moved to secure recent gains, ahead of September’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Polygon was also in the green, hitting a two-week high in the process.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was a notable gainer in today’s session, as the token raced to a multi-week high.
 
Following a low of $0.5092 on Tuesday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday peak at $0.5233 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the surge in price, XRP climbed to its highest point since August 31, when price peaked at $0.5285.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came as the relative strength index (RSI) broke free of a ceiling at 48.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 50.66, with bulls possibly targeting a ceiling at 58.00.
 
In the event traders reach this target, there is a strong chance XRP will move above $0.5500.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
In addition to XRP, polygon (MATIC) also surged to a multi-week high on Wednesday, despite market uncertainty ahead of the Fed announcement.
 
MATIC/USD peaked at $0.5486 earlier in today’s session, after rebounding from a low of $0.536 the day before.
 
The move pushed polygon to its strongest level since September 8, when the token reached a high of $0.5586.
 
 
Earlier gains have since faded, and this appears to be due to the RSI failing to break out of its ceiling at the 49.00 mark.
 
Currently, price strength sits at 47.34, however momentum remains largely bullish, ahead of a potential moving average crossover.
 
The 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) trend lines are on the cusp of an upwards cross, which could trigger a fresh price surge.

DOJ Wants Extra Day In Sam Bankman-Fried Trial
 
In a letter that was addressed to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, the judge in charge of the Sam Bankman-Fried trial, the US DOJ is requesting that a new date be added. The September 19 letter wants Judge Kaplan to approve an addition of Friday, October 6, to the trial dates already scheduled to begin on October 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its  
creation in 2011, Litecoin (LTC) has remained a notable digital asset in the  
fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies. Its historical significance as a crypto  
pioneer cannot be overstated. However, in today's ever-changing crypto market,  
where does Litecoin stand, and what lays ahead for it?
The Unique  
Beginnings of Litecoin
Litecoin arose  
from a desire to address some of Bitcoin's restrictions. Litecoin sought to  
provide faster transaction confirmations and reduced costs by using an  
alternative hashing algorithm called Scrypt. This distinguishing feature  
distinguished it from its older sibling, Bitcoin, as a potential solution for  
everyday transactions and micropayments.
Litecoin has  
made major contributions to the cryptocurrency ecosystem throughout the years.…]]></summary>

The cryptocurrency exchange promptly took precautionary actions to mitigate the risks associated with a 51% attack, a situation that arises when a single entity controls over half of the computational power on a blockchain network.
 
Coinbase’s Mitigation Measures
 
Upon detecting this significant centralization in the Zcash network, Coinbase promptly increased the Zcash confirmation requirement to 110 block confirmations, elongating deposit times from an average 40 minutes to roughly 2.5 hours.

An ETF is a financial product that allows investors to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly own it.

Let's dive into the potential implications and outcomes.
