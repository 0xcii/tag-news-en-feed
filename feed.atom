Solana (SOL) remained near a two-month high to start the week, despite crypto markets beginning to consolidate recent gains.
 
SOL/USD hit an intraday high of $24.75 on Monday, which comes less than a day after falling to a bottom of $22.68.
 
This move means that the token remains close to this weekend’s high of $25.03, which was the strongest point for SOL since November 8.
 
 
From the chart, it appears as sentiment in solana is still somewhat bullish, which comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to track above a support point at 80.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 80.18, with solana trading at the $23.42 price point.
 
Should the index remain about 80.00 in the coming days, it is likely that SOL could once again move toward $25.00.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Like SOL, shiba inu (SHIB) bypassed today’s price consolidation, maintaining recent highs in the process.
 
Following a low of $0.00001009 on Sunday, SHIB/USD climbed to a peak of $0.00001099 earlier today.
 
Monday’s action has seen the meme coin continue to trade near the two-month high of $0.00001111, hit last Friday.
 
 
Like many cryptocurrencies last week, prices of shiba inu were mostly overbought in recent days, with the RSI falling from a ceiling at 80.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 73.00, with a floor at the 70.00 mark a possible target for sellers.
 
However, bulls seem to be rejecting this proposition on Monday, with some eyeing a rally back above $0.00001100 instead.

This is an opinion editorial by Mickey Koss, a West Point graduate with a degree in economics. He spent four years in the infantry before transitioning to the Finance Corps.
Barely a week into 2023, and I’ve seen Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano debate Michael Shellenberger and Joe Rogan interview Peter Zeihan. While these media impressions may seem unrelated, a common thread is sewn between the two: experts in different fields confidently professing uninformed opinions on Bitcoin. 
Zeihan’s misunderstandings can be heard in the last 20 minutes or so of the interview. In fact, our friend Guy Swann just made a nearly 90-minute long episode of “Bitcoin Audible” dedicated to teari…]]></summary>

Ever since cryptocurrency has gained popularity in a nation that inhabits 17.7% of the world’s population, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been eyeing ways to regulate the sector.
 
The RBI governor, Shaktikanta Das, has again expressed severe concerns about regulating the industry. This has kept crypto investors and enthusiasts on their guard as the annual budget date draws closer. The Central Bank of India has now issued a stern warning against the use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.
 
 
The situation was aggravated further owing to the crash of FTX. Governor Shaktikanta Das has time and again called crypto an ‘unstable instrument,’ which is ‘nothing but gambling’ as private di…]]></summary>

Large Bitcoin Whales Have Added 37,100 BTC To Their Holdings In Recent Days
 
As per data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, multiple Bitcoin holder groups have displayed some strong accumulation recently. The relevant indicator here is the “BTC Supply Distribution,” which tells us which wallet groups on the network are holding what percentage of the total supply right now.
 
The wallet groups here refer to ranges that denote the upper and lower bound for the number of coins that each wallet in a given group is currently holding. For instance, the 1-10 coins band includes all wallets that are carrying at least 1 BTC and at most 10 BTC right now.
