This decision comes in response to an ongoing investigation by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD) into the company’s data collection and processing practices.
 
This pause reflects a broader scrutiny under which the Worldcoin project finds itself across various global jurisdictions.
 
The AEPD’s investigation is not isolated; similar concerns have been raised by data protection authorities in other countries, including Germany and Hong Kong.
