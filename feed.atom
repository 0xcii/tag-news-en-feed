Bitcoin 7-Day Hashrate Hits New ATH Despite Struggling Price
 
The “mining hashrate” is an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that the miners have currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
This metric can have a direct impact on the strength of the network’s security. This is because the more mining rigs are attached to the chain, the more difficult it is to perform a 51% attack.
 
This is only given, of course, that the hashrate is sufficiently decentralized. With the rise of large public miners, there have been concerns that the hashrate is increasingly becoming centralized, but the latest data has revealed that these public ent…]]></summary>

former partner, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), revealed that he and SBF committed  
multiple financial crimes related to their oversight of the now-bankrupt crypto

Prosecutors claim that FTX directed customers' funds  
straight into a bank account controlled by Alameda, which was not related to  
FTX except for a common founder. This action, they argue, misled customers  
about where their money was and how it was being used, creating a web of

Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has seen several difficult months of various legal challenges, and recently sold all assets of their Russian branch to a company only founded days earlier.
The trouble began for this major exchange in June, when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance for alleged violation of securities law.

Thorswap Pauses Amidst FTX Hack Fallout; RUNE Value Takes a Hit
 
After the FTX hacker moved thousands of ether (30,000 ETH) for the first time since the November 2022 breach, onchain observers noted that the funds were sent to Thorswap and the decentralized finance (defi) application Railgun. On October 6, 2023, Thorswap updated the community and said that the dex was down for maintenance. The dex team said:
 

Yesterday, following a careful evaluation of the situation and consultation with advisors, legal counsel, and law enforcement, the decision was made to temporarily transition the Thorswap interface into maintenance mode.
 
The dex will remain paused until “until a more permanent and robust solution” becomes available. Thorchain’s native crypto asset RUNE dropped 8.6% on the news. Thorswap said the developers are doing everything they can to get the application back up and running again.
 

 
“Swaps are paused. LP actions, Earn (savers), Borrow (lending), Staking actions are all fully operational,” Thorswap further detailed.
 
Consensys product manager Taylor Monahan insisted on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that over the past four months, “more than 50% of the ether to Thorswap router to bitcoin transactions have been stolen funds.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avalanche rose to a six-week high on Friday, after the token climbed above a key resistance level. The move saw price rise by as much as 7%, despite the global crypto market cap mostly in the red in today’s session. Toncoin remained higher, following recent gains. 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
Avalanche (AVAX) was a big mover on Friday, as the cryptocurrency rose by as much as 7% during the day.
 
Following a low of $9.85 on Thursday, AVAX/USD rose to a peak of $10.80 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move pushed avalanche to its highest level since August 29, past a key price ceiling of $10.00 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) also escaped a resistance level of its own at 65.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength now resides at 68.54, which is its highest point since mid-April this year.
 
The next target for current buyers will likely be $11.00, however with the price now overbought, a reversal could also be on the cards.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was in the green for a second straight session, moving closer to a key resistance level in the process.
 
TON/USD jumped nearly 3% higher on Friday, peaking at the $2.15 level at the time of writing.
 
Overall, this is the strongest point TON has hit since the end of September, when price last collided with a ceiling of $2.25.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that this occurred as the RSI continued to close in on a ceiling at the 57.00 mark.
 
With price strength now at a reading of 54.22, the chances are high that a move to 57.00 will result in toncoin trading at $2.25.

Although Kiyosaki doesn’t currently hold any Apple shares, he suggested that the recent drop in Apple’s stock price, which has dipped below the $150 mark, might be an opportune time to consider an investment.
