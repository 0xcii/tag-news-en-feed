        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin market has been riddled with several whale selloffs since June. The majority of these selloffs have emerged from miners and a few other whales, although recent news has emerged that the German government is also selling off its holdings. 
 
Due to the enormous scale of the transactions, selloffs by the government can be classified as whale movements. Many market participants can also argue that they’ve contributed to an increase in selling pressure and a price decline for Bitcoin. 
 
 
However, Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, doesn’t resonate with this school of thought. According to him, reactions to selloffs from wallets linked to governments are mostly overrated. Interestingly, his take is based on the cumulative value of Bitcoin inflows in the past year.

Bitcoin spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds), on the other hand, appear to be benefitting from the recent dip in prices, having posted a positive week in terms of capital flow.
 
According to the latest data, a significant amount of capital flowed into the Bitcoin investment products despite the poor performance of the flagship cryptocurrency.
