        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin rose by as much as 6% in today’s session, as the token climbed past a key resistance level on Thursday. The move came following several attempts over several weeks, with bulls finally breaking through. Polygon was also higher, ending a recent losing streak. 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was one of Thursday’s notable gainers, as prices moved past a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $88.35 on Thursday, LTC/USD rose to an intraday peak at $94.21 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s rally, litecoin broke out of its recent ceiling at $93.00, hitting a two-week high in the process.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that Thursday’s surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 58.00.
 
Since the breakout, the index has continued to climb, and as of writing this is currently tracking at 59.76.
 
In the event momentum continues in this direction, there is a strong chance that LTC will move above $95.00.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) snapped a three-day losing streak on Thursday, following a crossover of moving averages (MA).
 
The 10-day (red) MA crossed its 25-day (blue) counterpart in today’s session, sending the price to a peak of $0.8974.
 
This comes following Wednesday’s low at $0.8787, which saw MATIC hit its weakest point since May 25.
 
 
Overall, market volatility in polygon remains significantly high, with earlier gains almost fading.
 
As of writing, MATIC is trading at $0.8934, with the RSI at a reading of 46.03, which is close to a ceiling of 48.00.
 
Should this aforementioned point of resistance be broken, bulls could force a move toward $0.9000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Ethereum average transaction fees have dropped by almost 70% since early May. Here’s what it may mean for the asset.
 
Ethereum Average Transaction Fees Has Sharply Declined Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the average fee on the network was around $14 not too long ago. The “average transaction fees” here naturally refers to the total amount of fees (in USD) that the average user is attaching with their transfers right now.
 
This indicator’s value is dependent on the amount of traffic that the Ethereum network is receiving currently. Whenever the traffic on the blockchain is low, the users have no need to attach exorbitant amounts of fees as the network usually has enough capacity to handle the transactions quickly anyway.

Binance Australia Struggles with Banking Challenges
Binance's decision to suspend AUD deposits and  
withdrawals through bank transfer was reportedly due to a problem  
with a local payments provider.  
The unidentified payments partner had given the exchange's users until  
17:00 June 1, 2023, AEST to withdraw their funds.
"We regret to  
inform you that AUD deposits and withdrawals by bank transfer are no longer  
available to Binance's Users in Australia," Binance Australia said.

I want to draw your attention to the fact that Bitcoin transactions ultimately occur between wallets. There are humans behind wallets, but this connection is not really what’s important. The pseudonymity of Bitcoin is thanks to the fact that there is no direct connection between the wallet and the person who owns it. It is what distinguishes a Bitcoin wallet from any other financial instrument. No matter how much regulators try to change this, the core of the technology remains the same. 
What does this mean? It means that, soon, wallets will be recognized as entities deserving of legal rights.

Tether Market Cap Skyrockets to $83.23 Billion, Breaking Previous May 2022 Record
 
With a market cap of $83.23 billion, tether (USDT) has now surpassed the stablecoin’s prior highest market capitalization. The previous peak in market cap happened just before Terra’s formerly stable coin UST lost its peg on May 9, 2023.

        <updated>2023-06-01T13:24:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to erase last week’s gains on Thursday, as prices dropped for a fourth straight session. The latest decline comes ahead of tomorrow’s non-farm payrolls (NFP) report from the United States. Despite today’s weakness, ethereum remained above $1,800.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved below the $27,000 level in today’s session, ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls report.
 
It is expected that the number of jobs added to the U.S. economy will come in at 190,000, less than the 253,000 sum the month prior.
 
BTC/USD fell to a low of $26,671.72 earlier in the day, which comes following a peak at $27,346.11 the day before.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this latest decline occurred as a result of the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a floor of 46.00.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 44.58, with a support point of 43.00 as a possible target.
 
Should this level be hit, there is a strong possibility that BTC will hit a floor of its own around $26,300.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was marginally lower today, however, it managed to remain above the $1,800 level.
 
Following a high of $1,887.71 on Thursday, ETH/USD declined to an intraday bottom at $1,846.23 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw ethereum edge towards a key price floor at $1,830, however, bulls have so far resisted this collision.
 
 
Similar to BTC, ETH has now fallen for a fourth straight day, with the catalyst being a failed break out of a ceiling at $1,930.
 
In addition to this, the RSI is now at a reading of 51.54, after failing to move past its own resistance at 59.00.
 
Overall, ETH has now rebounded from its previous low, and is now trading at $1,862.93.
