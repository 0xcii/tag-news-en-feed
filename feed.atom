In sum, the EIA will voluntarily terminate the illegal EIA-862 collection action they initiated, and they will commit to destroying all the information that they have received and may still receive under the EIA-862. Furthermore, they will also cancel and withdraw the February 9th, 2024 notice for collection, replacing it with a new Notice.
This new notice will run for a full 60 days from the date it is released in the Federal Register, and the EIA also has consented to ensure that any comments which have been received on the Feb. 9th notice will be incorporated and considered in the new notice.

Bitcoin Price Prediction Post Halving
 
While many crypto analysts foresee Bitcoin’s dramatic rise to new all-time following the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event, JP Morgan analysts have remained bearish. According to the analysts, a rise in production costs and mining difficulties could push the price of BTC down to $42,000 after the BTC halving event concludes.
