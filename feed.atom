BREAKING: $800 billion Standard Chartered Bank is building a spot #Bitcoin trading desk - Bloomberg

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 21, 2024
  
  
  
According to recent reports from Bloomberg, the new London-based Bitcoin trading desk will start operations soon and be part of the bank's FX trading unit. Standard Chartered has been positive on Bitcoin for years and is now moving to meet surging institutional demand.
Standard Chartered said, "We have been working closely with our regulators to support demand from our institutional clients to trade Bitcoin and Ether."
The bank already offers crypto custody through its stake in Zodia Custody. It is also an investor in Zodia Markets, which trades institutional Bitcoin and crypto. This bolt-on trading desk represents the next phase in Standard Chartered's Bitcoin push.
The move comes as Bitcoin ETFs gain approval and launch across major markets like the US, UK, Hong Kong and Australia. With institutional appetite growing, banks realize they must adapt to remain competitive.
Standard Chartered's offering of direct Bitcoin trading capabilities reflects the accelerating mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. It indicates that banks consider Bitcoin a crucial new asset class they can no longer avoid. 
This infrastructure buildout will, in turn, enable wider institutional adoption. Other major banks will likely follow Standard Chartered's lead in rolling out spot Bitcoin trading.]]></summary>

A Statement Made in 2017
In an interview with Canada’s BNN Bloomberg in 2017, Garlinghouse mentioned that he was “very, very long” on XRP, the digital token of Ripple. However, the lawsuit alleges that, in reality, he “sold millions of XRP” in that same year.
In his order on 20 June, Judge Phyllis Hamilton dismissed four allegations around Ripple’s “failure to register XRP as a security.”

Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Has Been Mostly Negative In The Past Month
 
As CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn pointed out in a post on X, the Net Taker Volume suggests a lack of strong taker buy volume in the past month.
 
The “Net Taker Volume” is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin taker buy and taker sell volumes. Naturally, the two volumes measure the buy and sell orders filled by takers in perpetual swaps.
 
 
When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the taker buy volume is greater than the taker sell volume right now. Such a trend implies the majority of the market shares a bullish sentiment.
