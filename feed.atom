The decision came as a precautionary measure to ensure public safety, and the suspension will remain in effect until relevant agencies can thoroughly assess the project to ensure it is devoid of risk.
 
Prior to the suspension, Kenya boasted a large number of venues, approximately 18, where individuals could visit “Orb” stations to verify their World IDs using the company’s spherical and mirrored iris-scanners.
 
 
However, due to overwhelming demand, the Orb operators moved their stations to the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) to accommodate the large number of people seeking verification.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Per a report from Semafor, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has been weighing on the possibility of filing fraud charges against crypto exchange Binance. The company has been in the eye of all major regulators worldwide in 2023 and might be about to face its biggest legal hurdle to date.
 
 
Binance At Risk Of Bank Run?
 
According to people familiar with the matter quoted by Semafor, the DOJ has been reluctant to file fraud charges for fear that this could trigger a “bank run.” In other words, the authorities are allegedly worried for investors and their funds if the crypto company becomes insolvent following a massive capital exodus.
 
If this happens, Binance will become the second major crypto exchange to face a bank run in over a year. In 2022, bankrupt exchange FTX faced a similar situation when reports about its financial state began circulating, leaving thousands of users with their funds “stuck” on the platform.
 
In that sense, the DOJ authorities are looking to implement other options, such as fines or an agreement with the company, Semafor wrote. As of this writing, there is no official statement from Binance or its top executives.
 
The company is currently facing a legal battle with U.S. regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint against the crypto platform and its U.S. subsidiary over allegedly violating securities laws.
 
This has negatively impacted Binance.US market share. If the DOJ proceeds with the fraud charges, the international arm could suffer a similar fate, confirming fears of a major bank run on the platform.
 
On this possibility, pseudonym crypto trader “Hsaka” stated: “The same run they’ve been trying to unsuccessfully ignite for the past few months?”
 
 
As of this writing, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market are negatively reacting to the news with the price of top coins tumbling into critical support levels.

prosecutors are mulling over whether to initiate criminal charges against  
Binance, thereby turning the heat on 13 civil charges filed by the securities  
watchdog against the top crypto exchange earlier in June, Semafor reported today  
(Wednesday), citing insider sources. However, the Department of Justice (DOJ)  
is worried that such action could lead to a bank run, throwing the exchange  
into a position similar to that of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange, FTX.

This marks a substantial increase from the mere 1% chance they assigned to it a few months ago.
 
“Based on recent events and new information Eric Balchunas and I are officially increasing our spot Bitcoin ETF approval odds to 65%,” Seyffart remarked on Twitter, adding, “that’s from 50% a couple of weeks ago and 1% a few months ago.”
 
Driving this revised prediction are multiple factors, including recent statements from SEC chair Gary Gensler, developments from leading digital asset manager Grayscale, and the SEC’s perceived approval of Coinbase’s Bitcoin exchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon rebounded from a four-week low on Wednesday, as bulls rejected a breakout below a key support point. The wider market cap was mostly higher in today’s session, led by the optimism surrounding Microstrategy’s latest bitcoin investment. Chainlink also jumped higher after recent losses. 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) bounced back higher during Wednesday’s session, as the token moved away from a recent four-week low.
 
After plunging to a bottom $0.6751 on Tuesday, MATIC/USD rallied to a peak of $0.7022 earlier in the day.
 
The move came as bulls rejected a breakout below a recent price floor of $0.6750, which coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) pushing away from its own support level.
 
 
After racing from the aforementioned point at 43.00, the index made an attempt to reach resistance of 45.00.
 
However, at the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 44.06, with MATIC back below $0.7000.
 
Overall, momentum appears to be bearish, with the token falling for five of the last seven sessions.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
In addition to polygon, chainlink (LINK) rebounded from a recent losing streak which resulted in price hitting a one-week low.
 
LINK/USD leaped to an intraday high of $7.70 during today’s session, following a drop to a low of $7.40 the day prior.
 
Yesterday’s decline pushed chainlink below a support point of $7.50, and to its weakest level since July 26.
 
 
LINK has managed to recover from its earlier drop, as the RSI climbed away from its own floor at the 55.00 zone.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 56.78, and appears to be making a move towards a ceiling of 60.00.
 
In the event that this level is hit, there is a good chance that LINK moves above $7.80.
