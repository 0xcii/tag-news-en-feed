This is an opinion editorial by Imo Babics, CMO of Relai, a Swiss-based, bitcoin-only investment app.
Europeans are not taking advantage of their purchasing power and it’s hurting their pockets. It is estimated that the financial wealth of Europeans would be €1.2 trillion higher if savers had invested their money instead of keeping it in the bank.

And only 17% of Europeans reported that they owned bitcoin in 2021. Data suggests that the number is similar when it comes to investing in stocks, with only 15…]]></summary>

Crypto Market Recently Flipped From Seeing Outflows To Inflows
 
According to the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the sector had been seeing only outflows since April 2022 until very recently. The relevant indicator here is the “realized cap,” which is a capitalization model that calculates a kind of “true value” for any given asset.
 
The model puts the value of each token in the circulating supply at the price at which it was last moved (which is different from the usual market cap, which uses the same current price of the asset for the valuation of all the coins).
 
To assess the flow of capital into and out of the entire crypto market, Glassnode has consi…]]></summary>
