Bitcoin will revolutionize politics, not replace it. 
Even if hyperbitcoinization were to become a reality with Bitcoin at the center of the monetary system that emerges from the ruins of the current fiat system, the state would remain the dominus of international relations. It would rise from the ruins of its predecessors, like a phoenix from its ashes.
As Max Weber wrote over a hundred years ago in his famous essay "Economy and Society," the state will continue to utilize legal coercion and violence as its specific and distinctive means of action. This is due to its essence of being an aspiring monopolist of force internally and rex superiorem non recognoscentes externally.
Thanks to Bitcoin, the state will undergo new and diverse transformations, which are currently difficu…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Puell Multiple Has Plunged To Low Levels Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, BTC may be showing an opportunity that only comes once in a given bull cycle. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the “Puell Multiple,” which keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin miner revenue and the 365-day MA of the same.
 
 
The miners earn their income through two sources, block reward and transaction fee, but in the context of the Puell Multiple, only the block reward, which happens to make up for the majority of the mining revenue, is relevant.
 
The block reward here naturally refers to the BTC compensat…]]></summary>
