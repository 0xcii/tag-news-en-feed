The NFT market has seen so much come and go since this time, but the story of Squiggles has at least one more chapter left in it.
 
Reports have emerged on Thursday that a U.S. Federal Grand Jury is investigating the founders of the project, including reviewing the aforementioned manifesto document and social media posts.
 
Let’s dive into the latest in the ‘Squiggles saga.’

Speaking to CNBC, Dalio stated that what the crypto industry and Bitcoin have done over the past 12 years has been “amazing.” However, the hedge fund manager believes Bitcoin has “no relationship to anything.” For Dalio, Bitcoin is a “tiny” thing that gets “disproportionate attention.”
 
 
The price of Bitcoin moves on its own, while the value of Bitcoin is less than a third of the importance of Microsoft stock, Dalio said. For the Bridgewater hedge fund founder, there are more exciting assets in terms of value and storage of wealth.
