        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chelsea Football Club has closed a sleeve  
sponsorship deal with BingX, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange. This  
partnership will allow BingX's brand to appear on the club's kits for the  
remainder of this season.
Additionally, according to a report by The Athletic,  
there are plans to have the company's logo appear on the front of Chelsea's  
training kits in the upcoming 2024-25 season.
Sports Sponsorship in the Crypto Era
As the crypto world continues to gain traction,  
BingX, founded in 2018 and serving a colossal user base of over 10 million  
globally, aims to leverage this partnership to expand its brand presence.
Chelsea's constant pursuit of partnerships to  
enhance its commercial revenue stream reflects the competitive nature of modern  
football. With BingX on board, the English football club is embracing the world  
of cryptocurrency.
Currently, Infinite Athlete appears on Chelsea's  
front-of-shirt for this season. However, they will reportedly transition to  
adorning the club's training kit sleeve for the subsequent campaign. Notably,  
Chelsea is yet to finalize their front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024-25  
season.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Terraform Labs as a key precedent. This move is a strategic effort by the SEC to leverage the Terra ruling in its case against Binance, Binance.US, and former CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao.
 
SEC Modifies Legal Strategy Against Binance
 
The SEC’s argument hinges on the Terra case’s interpretation of the “investment contract” definition within the context of cryptocurrency offerings. The SEC posits that the court’s application of the Howey Test to classify UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR as investment contracts, and therefore as securities, is directly relevant to the products and services offered by the exchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Andrea Lerdo, a director at the art-supporting organization, Palm Foundation, Web3 enables creators and artists to not only exercise control over their content but to connect with their respective audiences in a way not possible on traditional platforms. For artists who have already carved out a niche in the Web2 space, “Web3 offers something Web2 can’t – true ownership.”
 
Barriers Blocking Creators From Entering Web3
 
Lerdo, however, acknowledged that many small creators seeking to unshackle themselves from the “constraints of algorithms and opaque platform policies” by venturing into Web3 might encounter significant challenges. For instance, artists attempting to dabble with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) may be overwhelmed by the tech’s complexity or the initial costs.

This move by the country’s top financial regulator targets a loophole that has allowed Korean citizens to circumvent existing regulations limiting cryptocurrency purchases using traditional credit cards.
 
 
The proposed amendment, if implemented, would further tighten South Korea’s grip on the burgeoning crypto market, raising questions about its potential impact on individual financial freedom and the broader adoption of digital assets within the country.
