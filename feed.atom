        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp rose for a fifth straight session on Thursday, as the token moved close to a two-week high. The rise comes as cryptocurrencies rebounded from recent losses, with the global market cap up 1.38% as of writing. Cardano also surged, hitting an 11-day peak.
 
XRP
 
Xrp, formerly ripple, was once again a big mover in cryptocurrency markets, climbing by as much as 5% on Thursday.
 
Following a low of $0.4389 on Wednesday, XRP/USD rose to a peak of $0.4713 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of this surge, the token moved to its strongest point since April 30, when price was above $0.4800.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that this latest rise comes as the relative strength index (RSI) moved beyond a key resistance level at 55.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is at the 55.71 mark, with the next visible ceiling at the 61.00 point.
 
If bulls were to take the RSI to this point, there is a good chance that XRP could recapture the $0.4800 level.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
In addition to XRP, cardano (ADA) also rose significantly, hitting an 11-day high in today’s session.
 
ADA/USD jumped to an intraday high of $0.3798 earlier today, which follows on from Wednesday’s low at $0.3658.
 
This has resulted in the token climbing for a third consecutive day, reaching its strongest level since May 7.
 
 
Overall, cardano is up by as much as 7% in the past week, this coming as the 10-day (red) moving average begins to gain momentum.
 
Should the trend line continue to climb in its current direction, a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart is highly likely.
 
For this to happen the RSI will need to break out of a ceiling at 47.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a report from The Block, Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency lending company that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year, had attempted to raise $1 billion for a project called Celsius Web Services (CWS).
 
 
CWS aimed to offer generic versions of Celsius’s yield and custody-focused products and was described as a “web3 toolbox for a New World” in pitch decks presented to Goldman Sachs and Abu Dhabi-backed fund ADQ May and June 2021, respectively.
 
 
Former Celsius CEO’s Plan
 
Celsius’s former CEO, Alex Mashinsky, spearheaded the CWS plan, but the project failed to get off the ground as investors, including Celsius’s board, chose not to participate. Mashinsky had hoped to pivot Celsius away from its core crypto lending business and create the “Amazon Web Services of crypto”…]]></summary>

Binance Proactively Withdraws Services To Canadians

According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, Lightspark aims to make the Lightning Network more accessible and mainstream, ensuring that payments are open, secure and instant.
The press release explained that the Lightspark Wallet SDK is the result of careful consideration of businesses' needs and feedback from customers. The SDK is tailored for seamless usage by businesses of all sizes and stages, the company stated, with easy integration and the ability to add unique UI and brand identity. It aims to simplify the complexity of Lightning payments, allowing businesses to focus on building exceptional user experiences without worrying about technical intricacies such as setting up channels and rebalancing liquidity.
The SDK also incorporates Lightspark Predict, which offers low latency, high payment success rates, and low costs, ensuring reliable and capital-efficient Lightning payments, according to the press release. By leveraging Lightspark Predict, the release explained, businesses gain better connectivity to the wider Lightning Network, enhancing reliability and certainty when sending and receiving Lightning payments.
Also highlighted by the company, were recent partnerships which proved the growing adoption of Lightning amongst businesses. Xapo Bank became the first bank to integrate with the Lightning Network via Lightspark, allowing its members to pay for small purchases with bitcoin directly, without converting to USD first. 
In addition, Lightspark highlighted partnerships with Rain, the largest crypto-asset platform in the MENA region, which is enabling its users to execute real-time bitcoin transactions using Lightspark, and Flexa, a digital commerce integration provider that has leveraged Lightspark “to help businesses navigate to the next era of commerce.”]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-sees-strong-rebound-as-biden-holds-debt-ceiling-talks/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-18T13:47:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded on Thursday, as markets responded to news that U.S. President Joe Biden held positive talks regarding the debt ceiling. Biden reportedly met with Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, in a bid to find an agreement. Ethereum also rose, moving back above $1,800.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded in today’s session, following news that Joe Biden had held positive talks with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, in regards to the debt ceiling.
 
Following a low of $26,600.14 on Wednesday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $27,465.93 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw bitcoin once again climb above a key level of resistance at the $27,300 mark, after a recent breakout.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge also coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moving beyond a ceiling at 42.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 44.58, and seems to be heading close to a higher resistance zone of 49.00.
 
In the event bulls take the index towards this point, there is a reasonable chance that BTC will move to $28,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) also trended higher, racing back over the $1,800 level in today’s session.
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,834.27 earlier today, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a bottom at $1,786.67.
 
This has resulted in the world’s second largest cryptocurrency bouncing from a support point at the $1,790 mark.
 
 
However, unlike bitcoin, the RSI on ethereum has still yet to move beyond its own resistance, which is at the 47.00 mark.
 
Price strength is currently at the 45.10 level, and should it cross the line of 47.00, more bulls will likely reenter the market.
