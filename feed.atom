The digital currency trades at around $71,000, a 50% increase since the ETFs’ inception but short of setting a new record high.
 
Charles Edwards, CEO of Capriole Investments, shared insights via a post on X addressing the community’s burning question: “Why aren’t we at $100,000 yet?” According to Edwards, the answer lies in several key factors beyond just the ETF inflows.
 
Why The Bitcoin Price Isn’t Rallying Higher
 
Edwards points out that US spot ETFs have absorbed 200% of the BTC mined since their launch in mid-January, a …]]></summary>

Then, quicker than a leg drop off the top turnbuckle, Hogan’s posts promoting HULK vanished into thin air, taking the token’s value with them. HULK crashed faster than a folding steel chair, plummeting to a measly $11,000. Investors were left reeling, their dreams of financial bliss shattered like …]]></summary>
