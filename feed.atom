The decision comes after judge John Dorsey postponed the ruling last week, citing concerns that the examiner could cost creditors tens of millions of dollars.
 
The U.S. Trustee’s Argument for an Independent Examiner Ultimately Overruled by the Court’s Authority
 
In the latest filing in the FTX bankruptcy case docket, judge John Dorsey has denied the appointment of an independent examiner. Dorsey stated that the current team, led by FTX CEO John J. Ray III, is “highly qualified” to handle the bankruptcy proceedings independently. The decision overrides the U.S. Trustee’s request to hire an independent examiner, which was said to be mandated…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are now more than 100,000 pieces of data inscribed directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain.
Just five days after reaching 50,000 inscriptions, Bitcoiners using the Ordinals protocol have now inscribed more than 100,000 pieces of data onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Since the project’s launch in January 2023, a seemingly endless stream of pictures, audio files and PDFs have been uploaded. 
As previously described, inscriptions, through the Ordinals protocol, allow users to embed data, usually images, directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, effectively enabling NFTs on Bitcoin. A full write-up on the technical ins-and-outs of the protocol can be found here. In addition, Matt Odell has recorded an episode of Citadel Dispatch with the creator of the protocol, Casey Rodarmor, which you can listen to here.
Prominent projects on Ordinals include Bitcoin Shrooms, Astral Babes and Bitcoin Punks, which are Bitcoin-based uploads of the original Ethereum CryptoPunks. One of these has now sold for as much as 9.5 BTC, or approximately $215,000 at the time of writing.

You can explore all of the various inscriptions via the inscriptions explorer. The platform has been rapidly adopted by a wide array of users, from artists to businesses. It has seen an explosion in usage in recent weeks, likely a result of the growing popularity of NFTs and the promise of a NFTs directly built onto the Bitcoin platform, inheriting all of the qualities that make Bitcoin the leading Layer 1 blockchain.]]></summary>

South Korea Follows Suit With SEC Crypto Staking Regulations 
 
This regulation implementation comes shortly after the crypto exchange Kraken’s case with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), whereby the U.S. regulator cracked down on the company’s staking program accusing the exchange of violating securities law.
 
The South Korean regulator’s latest move to examine staking services seems to be an aftermath of last week’s SEC crackdown on digital assets. According to the SEC, these services and products are considered unregistered securities.
