Scaramucci, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, shared his views in a recent interview with CNBC. He pointed to historical trends following halving events, which reduce the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation, as a reason for his bullish outlook.
 
 
Scaramucci predicts BTC price to reach at least $170,000 by the end of the current cycle, which aligns with past price surges after halvings. His long-term vision is even more ambitious, with a target of $400,000 – a price point that would represent half the market capitalization of gold.
