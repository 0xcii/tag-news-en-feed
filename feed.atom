        <updated>2023-02-27T11:07:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liquidators of the now defunct bitcoin trading platform, Mirror Trading International have so far used approximately $4.2 million on expenses such as lawyers’ or consultants’ fees. Between Jan. 23, 2023, and the date of their appointment, liquidators claimed to have recovered approximately $770,000 which belonged to MTI. 
 
Liquidators’ Fees
 
Liquidators of the collapsed bitcoin Ponzi scheme Mirror Trading International (MTI) have so far spent approximately $4.9 million (90.2 million rands) on lawyers and consultants since assuming control, a report has said. According to a Mybroadband report, a total of approximately $6.1 million has so far been disbursed while a further $7.3 million is earmarked for liquidators’ fees.
 
In April 2021, a Bitcoin.com News report said more than $70 million was raised from selling 1,281 bitcoins belonging to MTI. A few months later, another report said more than 8,000 BTC belonging to MTI had been “traced” and that investigators were on track to finding more.
 
 
However, according to the report, between Jan.23 and the day they took control of MTI assets, liquidators have so far recovered around $770,000. While liquidators are said to be expecting an “exponential increase in the amount recovered from the so-called net winners,” they are less certain about the growth rate of their expenditure.
 
According to the blockchain intelligence firm, Chainalysis, MTI was the biggest crypto scam in 2020 which netted more than $500 million for the scheme’s masterminds.

Mash, a monetization service powered by Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, has announced that people will no longer have to create an account on the service in order to utilize it.
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, “We’ve extended a large number of our widgets to allow users to donate and spend without creating an account on Mash. You have the additional option to scan and contribute with another lightning wallet for a donation, to purchase something and more. You can use any lightning powered wallet including CashApp, Strike, Blue Wallet, Breeze and XX.” 
 
         
         
         
         
    
Anyone can now go to sites that have Mash integrated and utilize the feature, by selecting "pay with another lightning wallet," scanning with a Lightning wallet, and then confirming the transaction.
The feature has also been extended to the Mash button so that you can donate easily without being logged in.
“There are multiple options immediately available, including a regular Lightning invoice, LN-URL QR code that you can and choose the amount in the other wallet, and a Lightning address that all creators and builders get,” describes the release.
Some of the benefits of integrating with Mash, according to the release, include one-click boosts and payments, a fluid mobile experience and auto-contributions.]]></summary>

Both sides have been relying on every available resource to support their military and humanitarian activities, and it seems that crypto assets and technology have become the latest tools in their arsenal.
 
A recent report by Elliptic, a blockchain forensics company, revealed that both countries have been accepting donations in the form of digital assets.
 
However, the report also showed that the targeted nation, Ukraine, has attracted more digital asset donations than its invader.
 
Since Russian forces attacked Ukraine on February 24th, 2022, both sides have been utilizing blockchain technology to obtain funding for their military campaigns, according to a rec…]]></summary>

Still, crypto investors should bear in mind some economic and financial data this trading week.
 
In particular, as Bitcoin has returned to its correlation with the U.S. stock indices and the dollar index (DXY), the price could be affected by this news.
 
Over the weekend, Bitcoin briefly corrected to a new 12-day low at $22,775, but still managed to end the week above $23,300. The new week will have to show whether the upward trend that has persisted since January will continue or whether there will be a deeper correction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin hardware company has begun manufacturing its own chip wrapper for the Trezor Model T.
Trezor, a Prague-based Bitcoin hardware company, has announced that it has taken control of its silicon chip supply chain.
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the company has achieved this by facilitating the manufacture of its own key component, the chip wrapper, for its flagship product, the Trezor Model T. The new chip wrapper “improves device security and significantly shortens lead times for mass production,” the release states.
With the silicon chip supply chain under constant geopolitical pressure, securing the manufacturing of this important component is a source of confidence in the ability for Trezor to continue producing its products. 
Štěpán Uherik, CFO at Trezor, commented that “The twists and turns in demand for hardware wallets and the silicon supply chain disruption that we’ve seen over the past few years was a problem that we needed to solve. By unpacking the process, identifying areas where we could take control, and collaborating with our partners in new ways, we’ve managed to make the manufacturing as agile as it can be.” 
He added that “It also adds more design freedom for future products, helping us to sustain our leadership in the increasingly competitive hardware wallet space.” 
SatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor, also announced last year the development of an open-source chip for usage in Bitcoin hardware. Just recently, the company detailed that the initial testing on the first chip, TROPIC01, had been completed, with expectations of continued testing throughout 2023.]]></summary>

According to on-chain data provider Lookonchain, two hours before press time, a “smart money” investor made a large Shiba Inu transfer. The whale just sent 182 billion SHIB, the equivalent of about $2.3 million to crypto exchanges Crypto.com and Gemini.
