This continuous decline has put the digital asset in a perilous position as it has dropped drastically on the list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.
 
Cardano Bows Out To Toncoin And Dogecoin
 
The first negative headwinds for Cardano began to blow when Toncoin, a cryptocurrency enjoy serious backing from Telegram, began to rise. As the Toncoin price rose, so did its market cap and in not time it was on its way to knocking a number of assets from their positions.
 
 
After beating Dogecoin, the Toncoin price continued to rise, reaching over $7. At this time, its market cap had jumped above $20 billion. This quickly placed it ahead of Cardano and then Dogecoin as it enjoye…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-awaited day of the 4th phase of Bitcoin's halving is looming in the cryptocurrency sector. The  
countdown to this event shows that it could happen around the final hours of Friday evening if  
you are located in the Americas or Saturday morning if you are in Asia or  
Europe.
According to the market metrics, the event is much anticipated and should be discounted well in advance of its actual occurrence. In contrast to unpredictable overnight barrages of rockets in the heat of the Middle East, the halving event has a clear outcome—the amount of BTC rewards  
that miners get for completing a block will be reduced in half to 3.125 BTC  
from the current 6.25.
This will inevitably lead to less supply from miners, but  
does it change the liquidity of the overall market? We will attem…]]></summary>

Everyone celebrates the halving each cycle as a moment where Bitcoin becomes a more scarce asset, an event where historically the price has skyrocketed in reaction to the change in the issuance schedule and everyone waits with bated breath for history to repeat itself. 
I’m sure everyone is all too familiar with these dynamics, so today as we all sit around waiting for block 840,000 to hit, let's look at a few lesser known facts about Bitcoin’s supply schedule and halvings:

Setting aside certain days for celebration, commemoration or remembrance is a nearly universal practice among humans. While different cultures and religions have their own unique customs and traditions, the entire human race seems to share an underlying propensity to recognize certain occasions as distinct from otherwise ordinary days. 
Finally, something we can all agree on! While the word “holiday” or Holy Day, literally means a day that is set apart, there are also examples of special occasions which extend beyond a 24 hour period such as Hanukkah, Ramadan or even the 12 days of Christmas.
