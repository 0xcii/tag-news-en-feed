In true millennial fashion, I consulted a handful of travel blogs to make sure I was well-prepared for the trip. 
A blog entry by a couple of tourists caught my attention. Be careful to avoid the advanced hike route, it read, as you might run into aggressive stray dogs.

Bitcoin Miner Revenue From Fees Has Dropped To Just 6% Now
 
At the end of 2022, a new application of the Bitcoin blockchain emerged: the “Inscriptions.” In simple terms, an Inscription is metadata “inscribed” onto the smallest unit of Bitcoin, the satoshis (sats).
 
Any data type can be attached with BTC transactions this way, as long as it abides by the block size limit of 4MB. Over 2023, applications of the technology like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and BRC-20 tokens gained life on the network.
