Taking to X on December 20, Kiepuszewski observed that some layer-2 solutions, such as Manta and Optimism, rely on sequencers to post data to Ethereum. However, without fraud-proofs, there is no way to verify that the data published by the Sequencer on the Ethereum mainnet is accurate or complete. 
 
In the co-founder’s view, whenever a sequencer posts the batch of transactions on the main net, there is no layer-1 state or event change. Per Kiepuszewski ‘s assessment, this is …]]></summary>

Before then, the legal expert had highlighted how XRP’s price action hasn’t been great, as it is down over 2% over the last month. Although the 2% drop seems to be significant to Morgan, he was choosi…]]></summary>
