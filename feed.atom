This initiative’s primary objective is to strengthen “market discipline” by providing investors with an all-encompassing insight into the digital currency holdings and activities of these financial institutions.
 
“Under the proposals, banks would be required to disclose qualitative information on their activities related to crypto assets and quantitative information on exposures to such assets and the associated capital and liquidity requirements,” The Basel Committee announced.

        <updated>2023-10-19T13:41:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin edged slightly higher on Thursday, following comments from the Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler. Gensler said the commission was currently reviewing eight to ten applications from firms looking to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded-fund (ETF).
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin snapped a two-day losing streak on Thursday, as markets reacted to comments on spot bitcoin ETFs from SEC Chair Gensler.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $28,566.75 on the news, following a low of $28,174.25 during Wednesday’s session.
 
Today’s move comes as bitcoin bulls pushed price back above a recent floor at the $28,200 level.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the bounce comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) jumped at a support point of its own at 63.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 64.35, which is marginally below the next point of resistance at 65.00.
 
In order for bullish momentum to intensify, this ceiling will first need to be broken in the coming hours or days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) on the other hand, fell for a third straight session, as the cryptocurrency collided with a long-term floor.
 
After hitting a high at $1,580.26 on Wednesday, ETH/USD plunged to an intraday low of $1,543.59 earlier today.
 
The move saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency close in on a support point at the $1,540 mark.
 
 
This comes as the 10-day (red) moving average continued to trend lower, and extend its downward cross with the 25-day (blue) trend line.
 
The last time bears forced a breakout below the aforementioned floor, ethereum went on to fall to a seven-month low.

Why Sam Bankman-Fried’s Lawyers May Be Indecisive On Next Step
 
According to a report by the Block, Sam Bankman-Fried’s lead counsel, Mark Cohen, had mentioned in court on October 18 that they were still considering whether or not to put up a case and if they do “of what nature.” Cohen’s statement is significant for several reasons.
