        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federal officials have initiated the process to transfer Sam  
Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX cryptocurrency exchange, to a new prison  
despite his preference to remain in New York to assist in preparing his appeal.  

Prison Transfer Despite New York Preference
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal today (Wednesday),  
this decision was made by overriding Bankman-Fried's request. Bankman-Fried,  
who was sentenced earlier this year to 25 years in prison for charges related  
to the collapse of FTX, including allegations of stealing $8 billion from  
customers, had expressed his desire to stay in New York to aid in his appeal  
process.
The transfer decision comes after Bankman-Fried was found  
guilty by a jury in November on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy, following  
the collapse of FTX in 2022. Prosecutors have labelled the collapse as one of  
the largest financial frauds in US history.

What The SEC’s Latest Filing Is About
 
The Commission filed a letter in opposition to Ripple’s motion to seal certain documents related to the remedies stage. In line with an earlier report, the SEC noted that they weren’t opposing Ripple’s requests in its entirety. For the opposed redactions, the Commission argued that the crypto firm had failed to “overcome the strong presumption that court filings should be public.”
 
 
The regulator mentioned that the materials they oppose a redaction are “fundamental to the rationale beh…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
You may have heard about re-enabling OP_CAT as a potential upgrade for bitcoin's script language. Depending on where you get your news OP_CAT has been called "only 10 lines of code", "the best way to enable experimentation with covenants", "too powerful", "dangerous and leading to miner centralization", or "guaranteed to lead to a contentious soft fork". I'm going to make the case that all of these perspectives are mistaken. OP_CAT is very useful, can be used as a covenant, and not (alone) the best next move for bitcoin. Nothing more, and nothing less.
To make that case, I'm going to explore several (apparently disjoint) topics, some of which were new to me a few short months ago. I'm going to try and arrange this in a way that provides the necessary background in one place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency exchange landscape is a battlefield of trust. With centralized platforms still reeling from high-profile scandals like FTX and Celsius, any misstep can send user loyalty plummeting. Nexo, a platform that had recently emerged relatively unscathed, now finds itself in hot water after a surprise fee increase sparked outrage amongst its customer base.
 
 
From Hero To Zero: Trust Eroded By Unannounced Fees
 
Nexo had managed to carve out a niche as a customer-centric exchange. Their ability to dodge legal troubles and a swift reversal of a disliked fee policy in April had painted a picture of a platform that listened. However, this carefully crafted image shattered on May 21st when users woke up to emails announcing a significant hike in bank transfer fees.
