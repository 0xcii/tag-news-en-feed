This meant that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did not agree with the ruling, and while the interlocutory appeal has been approved by the court, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has called the move laughable as he dismantles the SEC’s appeal.
 
Pro-XRP Lawyer Says Interlocutory Appeal Filing Is Ironic
 
In a post titled ‘The Irony of Interlocutory Appeal’, Deaton shared his thoughts on the SEC’s interlocutory appeal. The post which was published on Thursday, September 28, on the Crypto Law website explains how the appeal filing may end up being in favor of Ripple.

Fortress Trust, a subsidiary of Fortress Blockchain Technologies that offers  
wallet and payment services. Less than a month after announcing its intention  
to acquire the firm, Ripple has chosen to back out of the deal.
Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, said on X (formerly  
Twitter): "A few weeks ago, we signed a letter of intent to acquire  
Fortress Trust, we've since made the decision not to move forward with an  
outright acquisition, though Ripple will remain an investor in Fotress

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to trade above the $27,000 level on Friday, after a surge beyond this point towards the end of yesterday’s session. Ethereum rallied to a one-week high.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin remained above the $27,000 level on Friday, following a late rise in bullish sentiment towards the end of Thursday’s session.
 
Following a low of $26,424.95 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $27,259.50 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, bitcoin rose to its highest level since September 20, when price peaked at $27,393.00.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
However, earlier gains have since edged lower, largely due to a collision which took place on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Looking at the chart, the index was unable to push past a resistance level of 58.00, and has since fallen to a reading of 56.57.
 
Traders could be awaiting the release of this afternoon’s consumer sentiment report in the United States, prior to deciding their next move.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) continued to trend higher on Friday, breaking out of a key resistance level in the process.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,687.28 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after trading at a low of $1,620.68.
 
This surge has resulted in ethereum climbing over a long held ceiling at $1,670, hitting a one-month high in the process.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
The latest uptrend coincided with the relative strength index moving beyond a ceiling of its own at 57.00. It is now tracking at 58.61.
 
Bulls will likely remain unsatisfied until they take ethereum back above $1,700, which hasn’t happened since the end of August.
