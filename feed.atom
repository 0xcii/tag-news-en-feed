        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced that former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi and his brother, Nikhil Wahi, have settled insider trading charges. The SEC alleged that Ishan Wahi helped coordinate Coinbase’s public listing announcements, which included information about the crypto assets that would be available for trading.
 
Despite being warned not to trade based on this confidential information, Ishan repeatedly tipped off his brother and a friend, Sameer Ramani, about the timing and content of upcoming listing announcements. Ahead of these announcements, Nikhil Wahi and Ramani allegedly purchased at least 25 crypto assets, nine of which were securities, and sold them shortly after the announcements for a profit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paxful, a global peer-to-peer Bitcoin platform, has announced the appointment of Roshan Dharia as the new Interim Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. This comes after a brief shutdown period of the exchange prior to the departure of Co-Founder and former CEO Ray Youssef.
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, Dharia will be responsible for strengthening operations and exploring strategic alternatives for the company. With over eight years of experience, Dharia expressed his enthusiasm for the role, stating, "It's a great honor to become CEO of Paxful. Over the last eight years, Paxful has been a pioneer in establishing the real use cases of Bitcoin and helping millions of people in the process."
Previously a senior executive at TrustToken (now known as Archblock), Dharia led the DeFi institutional lending business. He also founded and built the investment platform PTHL Affiliates, specializing in distressed private company acquisitions and turnarounds. 
Srinivas Raju, the Custodian of Paxful, expressed his confidence in Dharia's leadership, stating, "I'm delighted that Roshan has joined Paxful and will take over day-to-day management of the company. I'm confident under his leadership the business will keep building a financial system that truly serves the 100%."
Youssef’s recent departure at Paxful was reportedly a result of a feud involving a myriad of accusations and legal disputes with co-founder Artur Schaback, who is currently the COO of the exchange.
Since its establishment in 2015, Paxful has experienced significant growth, attracting over 12 million users worldwide and facilitating billions of dollars in trades on its platform, according to the press release.]]></summary>
