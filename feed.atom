        <updated>2023-08-17T19:13:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an announcement today, Bitcoin hardware wallet company Trezor revealed the launch of the highly anticipated coinjoin feature for its Trezor Model One, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Building upon the success of the coinjoin implementation for the Trezor Model T in April 2023, this development empowers all Trezor users, regardless of their device, to fortify their bitcoin transactions with enhanced privacy.
Coinjoin enables users to send their bitcoin within a collaborative transaction, only to receive an equivalent amount back. This process obscures transaction history, making it much more difficult to track transactions and user balances on the transparent Bitcoin blockchain. Trezor's collaboration with Wasabi Wallet, a privacy-focused bitcoin wallet with coinjoin capability, made this feature's integration possible.
“Born in 2013, the Trezor Model One is the original hardware wallet and is widely used by Trezor fans in over 150 countries," said Matěj Žák, CEO at Trezor. "Giving those users the option of making their transactions private is just as important as it is with the Trezor Model T. Our extended coinjoin availability puts control, privacy and security in the pocket of every Trezor user.”
According to the release, Trezor has become the first hardware wallet to enable coinjoin transactions within a hardware wallet environment. In addition to coinjoin, Trezor also has a host of features on its devices for enhancing security and privacy, such as Tor, coin control, and Shamir backup.
For those seeking more insights into the coinjoin feature and its implications for bolstering transaction privacy, more information can be found at here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu fell lower for a fifth straight session on Thursday, resulting in the meme coin dropping to a 13-day low. Since hitting a four-month high last Saturday, SHIB has struggled to find a firm floor. On the other hand, Solana ended a recent losing streak.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was a notable gainer on Thursday, as the meme coin moved lower for a fifth consecutive day.
 
SHIB/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.000008543 earlier in today’s session, following a peak of $0.000009854 the day prior.
 
This decline pushed SHIB to its lowest point since August 4, when price traded at a low of $0.00000827.
 
 
The latest drop comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell below a support point of 50.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.31, with a floor of 39.00 the next possible target.
 
In the event it reaches this target, SHIB will likely be trading below $0.000008000.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
On the other hand, solana (SOL) returned to the green during today’s session, snapping a two-day losing streak in the process.
 
Following a low of $22.49 on Wednesday, SOL/USD climbed to an intraday high of $23.58 earlier in the day.
 
The move comes as bullish pressure resurfaced, following a marginal breakout below a support point at $22.50.
 
 
This rebound comes following a recent upward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving average.
 
Despite this, there is still a high level of market uncertainty, as price strength hovers close to a key floor at 44.00.
 
Should it break out of this point, SOL could move below $22.00.
