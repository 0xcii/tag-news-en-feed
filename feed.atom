Alex Blania, CEO and co-founder of Tools For Humanity, the company behind Worldcoin, stated that the next iteration would be akin to an “Apple product.”
 
Worldcoin Redesigns the Orb to Be “Much More Friendly”
 
Worldcoin, the biometric ID and wallet project, is making changes to the Orb, a device used to scan the irises of users wishing to prove their personhood, to make it less polarizing. Alex Blania, CEO of Tools for Humanity, explained that the current design of the Orb was agreed upon before he arrived at the company almost four years ago.
 
Blania hopes to tone down the device with a programmed upgrade, making it more appealing and adding personalization options. In a chat, Blania told Techcrunch more about this redesign. He explained:
 

The new Orb is coming and the next iterations will look quite different.
 
Furthermore, Blania clarified that this new version of the Orb will be more friendly and appealing, similar to an Apple product. He also acknowledged that the current design was polarizing, with some people loving it and some hating it due to its sci-fi-like appearance.
 
While there was no announcement of the precise date of the reveal of this upgraded Orb, Blania stated that it would be launched in the first half of 2024 and that it had already been field-tested.
 
The Wordcoin project, launched officially in June, already has more than 3 million unique users in 120 countries, registering more than 190,000 signups just in the last week. In July, Sam Altman, co-founder of the Worldcoin project, declared that the project was accelerating, reporting that there was one signup every eight seconds.
