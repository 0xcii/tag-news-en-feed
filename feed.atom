        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin network is set to record another meaningful difficulty increase on Sunday, Jan. 29, 2023, as current estimates expect it to rise 3.82% higher. The change follows the last difficulty retarget, which advanced by 10.26% to the current all-time high of 37.59 trillion.
 
Block Time Breakdown: How Faster Discovery is Impacting Bitcoin Difficulty
 
In just over a day, the Bitcoin network will see a difficulty increase of around 3.82%, according to current estimates. Right now, the mining difficulty is already at an all-time high (ATH) at 37.59 trillion, and with a 3.82% jump, it’s expected to be around 39.03 trillion. The number of hashes needed to mine a block is directly proportional to the difficulty level, which means each participating miner needs to perform 39.03 trillion hashes in order to mine a block at that level.
 
 
The average Bitcoin block time has been around 8:54 minutes to 9:31 minutes, which has been lower than the 10-minute average. This too is linearly related to the estimated increase expected on Jan. 29.
 
 
This is because when blocks are discovered faster than the 10-minute average, the 2,016 blocks in between difficulty retargets are also found faster than the two-week average. As a result, the Bitcoin protocol’s mining difficulty rises. With BTC’s price higher, a lot more hashrate has been dedicated to the blockchain.
 
 
Bitcoin’s hashrate is running high with an average of 278.2 exahash per second (EH/s) during the last 2,016 blocks. Foundry USA commands the top position in terms of mining pools with the most amount of dedicated SHA256 hashrate. Foundry has around 93.82 EH/s, over a three-day period, which accounts for 32.99% of the network’s computational power. The Bitcoin mining pool Antpool has dedicated 49.57 EH/s to the Bitcoin network over a three-day span, accounting for 17.43% of the hashpower.
 
What impact do you think this difficulty increase will have on the overall Bitcoin network and its miners? Share your thoughts in the comments below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated on Friday, as traders prepared for the release of the upcoming consumer sentiment figures from the United States. Following a move to a five-month high on Thursday, prices were once again below $23,000. Ethereum also slipped, moving below $1,600 in the process.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell back below $23,000 on Friday, as markets consolidated ahead of U.S. consumer sentiment data.
 
BTC/USD slipped to a bottom of $22,654.59 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $23,215.00.
 
The drop came ahead of this afternoon’s U.S. consumer sentiment report, which is expected to come in at a reading of 64.6.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) also edged closer to a floor of 78.00, leading to a slight shift in momentum.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average continues to move in an upward direction, however should the index move below 78.00, this trend will likely reverse.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 79.64, with BTC/USD trading at $22,965.60.
 
 
Ethereum
 
There was a slight shift in sentiment in ethereum (ETH), with prices moving below $1,600 during today’s session.
 
Following a high of $1,619.45 on Thursday, ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,565.25 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s move came as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency was unable to break out of a resistance level of $1,640 on Wednesday.
 
 
Since this time, prices have moved to lower lows in back-to-back sessions, with ethereum’s RSI also dropping below a key point of support.
 
The index is tracking at 61.94, which is marginally under its recent floor at 63.00, and its weakest level since January 8.
 
Should this bearish trend continue into the weekend, there is a strong possibility that ETH will hit a floor at $1,500.

This is an opinion editorial by Konstantin Rabin, a finance and technology writer.
I am one of those who was fortunate enough to find out about Bitcoin more than a decade ago before it gained mainstream attention. Sadly, I am also one of the morons who saw this opportunity, didn’t think too much of it at first and let it fly by. 
In this little story, I’d like to share the path that led me to pass on investing in bitcoin three different times before eventually giving in and becoming a HODLer. So, here are the key lessons I learned along this journey that are worth sharing with anyone who is still doubting BTC.

In a court filing, FTX attorneys requested that Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, testify under oath and produce financial papers regarding their personal fortune as part of the company’s effort to reclaim funds that may be used to repay creditors.
 
Gabriel, the brother of former FTX CEO Bankman-Fried, will also be questioned in court over any financial benefits he may have gotten from the company.
