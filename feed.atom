Current DCG chief financial officer Mark Shifke succeeds Silbert and is joined by Edward McGee and Matthew Kummell as members of the new look board. 
 
Preparing for Grayscale’s Next Chapter
 
Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, has resigned from his position as chairman of the digital asset management company Grayscale and will be replaced by Mark Shifke.
 
According to the company’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), starting Jan. 1, 2024, Grayscale’s board will be composed of Mark Shifke, Matthew Kummell, and Edward McGee. Current Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein is also a board member, while Mark Murphy, the president of Digital Currency Group (DCG), departs alongside Silbert.
 
Commenting on the changes to the board, an unidentified Grayscale spokeswoman reportedly said:
 
“Grayscale and our investors will benefit from their respective experiences in the financial services and asset management industries as we prepare for Grayscale’s next chapter.”
 
The changes to the Grayscale Investments board are coming at a time when the SEC is considering the company’s request to turn its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).
