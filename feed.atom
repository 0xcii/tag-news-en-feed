Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Dived Down Recently
 
As the Bitcoin network works on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, validators called miners have to compete with each other using computing power to get a chance to add the next block to the chain.
 
The total measure of this computing power that’s currently connected to the BTC blockchain is known as the “mining hashrate.” This metric can directly correlate to the security of the network, since if a malicious entity has to succeed in an attack, it has to take over at least 51% of the total computing power.
 
 
Naturally, when the hashrate goes up, so does the resistance of the blockchain, as there…]]></summary>
