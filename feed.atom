Retail Resurgence: Small-Scale Investors Propel Crypto Market Rally
 
The analysis conducted by JPMorgan’s research team, led by Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, revealed that the resurgence of “small-scale investors,” often referred to as ‘mom-and-pop’ traders, has been instrumental in propelling popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to two-year peak this month.

To them, Bitcoin represented a revolutionary challenge to State-controlled money and authority. As such, it has come to symbolize a disruptive shift toward greater freedom and autonomy for individuals in modern society.
Yet as Bitcoin gains mainstream traction, there are more and more signs it may be shedding its revolutionary roots. The exponential growth in users and market value has corresponded with a dilution of the liberty-oriented ethos that initially defined the technology. In a future hyperbitcoinized world, will Bitcoin still embody the libertarian ideals that sparked so much excitement among its…]]></summary>

Kraken Responds to The US SEC 
 
Bill Morgan, a legal expert, shared the information concerning the lawsuit on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on Friday. “It is interesting how Kraken summarises and references a significant portion of the Ripple case,” Morgan stated. 
 
 
Morgan highlighted that Kraken bases its stance on the claim that the SEC has not been able to develop a direct connection between the issuers of certain coins, which the commission calls “crypto asset securities.”

Bluntz hinted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that WIF’s next move to the upside could be the one that makes its price go “turbo parabolic.” He added that the meme coin would unlikely see any further pullback at the $0.50 resistance. From the accompanying chart the analyst shared, one could see that he was hinting at the meme coin hitting $1 when this parabolic move happened.
