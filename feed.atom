        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin slipped below the $34,000 level earlier in today’s session, ahead of the upcoming consumer sentiment report in the United States. Data on Thursday showed that the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 4.9% in Q3, largely driven by consumer spending. Ethereum moved below the $1,800 level to start the day.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin slipped below the $34,000 mark on Friday, as markets consolidated ahead of U.S. consumer sentiment figures.
 
BTC/USD fell to a low at $33,762.32 earlier in today’s session, which comes following a peak at $34,649.40 the day before.
 
As a result of the decline, bitcoin continued to pull away from a recent 18-month high, as bears began to gradually seize market sentiment.

This comes as the relative strength index (RSI) remained in overbought territory, with a current reading of 83.68.
 
Bulls in the market seem reluctant to let go of their positions, and have gone on to once again push BTC above $34,000.
 
Overall, BTC remains nearly 15% higher than at the same time last week, despite the recent price consolidation.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also edged lower in today’s session, falling below the $1,800 mark in the process.
 
After reaching a high of $1,857.81 on Thursday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,764.01 earlier in the day.
 
This decline has seen ETH snap a seven-day bull run, pushing the cryptocurrency away from a multi-month high in the process.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
The drop coincided with the RSI failing to breach a resistance level of 74.00, and it is now tracking at a reading of 71.13.
 
Traders who are holding onto their long positions may begin to reconsider this, should the index fall below the 70.00 mark.

negotiate the ever-changing crypto market landscape, it's worth looking for  
signs that another Bitcoin bull run is in the works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taiwan  
has taken its initial steps towards the regulation of digital assets by  
presenting a crypto bill to the Legislative Yuan for its first reading. The  
proposed legislation, known as the Virtual Asset Management Ordinance Draft  
bill, aims to define virtual assets, establish operational standards for asset operators,  
ensure customer protection, and mandate membership in industry associations and  
regulatory permissions.
Regulatory Drive in Taiwan:  
Fueled by FTX's Collapse
Taiwan  
has adopted a relatively hands-off approach to the cryptocurrency sector,  
primarily regulating it under existing know-your-customer and anti-money  
laundering laws. 
However,  
the regulatory process gained momentum following the collapse of the crypto

Noting that crypto accounts linked to Hamas have been seized or frozen, Elliptic says: “This illustrates the weakness of crypto as a terrorism fundraising tool. The transparency of the blockchain allows illicit funds to be traced, and in some cases linked to real-world identities.”

His testimony provided a glimpse of what line of argument is to be expected from the defense as the case progresses. As Bankman-Fried’s lawyers questioned him, they emphasized on a particular document that could be the key to exonerating the defendant. 
 
Why This FTX Document Is So Important
 
According to a post by Inner City Press, which live posted happenings at the trial, Bankman-Fried’s primary counsel, Mark Cohen, had questioned the defendant about a ‘Document Retention Policy.’ In reply, SBF mentioned that the policy had been drawn up by the law firm Fenwick and West and, more specifically, Dan Friedman.
