According to a survey carried out by Finder, a prominent fintech platform, 55 fintech specialists expect that Shiba Inu will rise to $0.00004930 by 2025. If that happens, it will represent a significant increase from its current price level, with the meme coin’s price currently one zero behind, trading at around $0.000008. 
 
 
One of the panelists, Alexander Kuptsikevich from FxPro, seemed cautious of SHIB’s future trajectory, considering its status as a meme coin. He stated how SHIB was “just one of many meme coins”…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of deliberation, Montenegrin  
authorities have extradited Han Chang-joon to South Korea, according to a notice by the Government of Montenegro. The move comes as  
both the U.S. and South Korea seek jurisdiction over Kwon to address criminal  
charges related to the collapse of Terraform Labs, a multibillion-dollar crypto  
enterprise, in May 2022.
Ongoing appeals
The extradition underscores the severity of the  
charges, as Han faces criminal proceedings in South Korea for various financial  
offenses. Meanwhile, Kwon's appeal regarding his extradition fate remains in  
the hands of Montenegro's appeals court, adding complexity to the legal matter.
Han Chang-joon and Terra co-founder Do Kwon faced  
arrest in March 2023 while attempting to travel with falsified documents.  
Subsequently, a Montenegro court sentenced them to four months in prison,  
sparking a contentious legal battle over their extradition.
The statement from the authorities, translated from  
Serbian, stated: "This person was deprived of his liberty in Montenegro on  
March 23, 2023, at Podgorica Airport, according to an international warrant  
issued for him by Interpol Seoul together with D.H.K., and after serving a  
four-month prison sentence in Montenegro for of the committed criminal offense  
of document forgery, extradited from Montenegro."
