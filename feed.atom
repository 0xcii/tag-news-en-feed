Schiff has always been supportive of gold. He talked about the recent rise in the price of the precious metal and said that it has now reached a new high of just under $2,450.
 
 
Schiff didn’t miss the chance to poke fun at Bitcoin by saying that it had dropped 30% since its record high in 2021. “Gold continues to show its worth as a stable and valuable product, while Bitcoin shines as a speculative bubble,” he said. His views come at a time when the price of Bitcoin is going through big changes, which adds to the fight between traditional assets and digital ones.
