Liquidators’ Fees
 

 
Liquidators of the collapsed bitcoin Ponzi scheme Mirror Trading International (MTI) have so far spent approximately $4.9 million (90.2 million rands) on lawyers and consultants since assuming control, a report has said. According to a Mybroadband report, a total of approximately $6.1 million has so far been disbursed while a further $7.3 million is earmarked for liquidators’ fees.
 

 
In April 2021, a Bitcoin.com News report said more than $70 million was raised from selling 1,281 bitcoins belonging to MTI. A few months later, another report said more than 8,000 BTC belonging to MTI had been “traced” and that investigators were on track to finding more.
 

 

 

 
However, according to the report, between Jan.23 and the day they took control of MTI assets, liquidators have so far recovered around $770,000. While liquidators are said to be expecting an “exponential increase in the amount recovered from the so-called net winners,” they are less certain about the growth rate of their expenditure.
 

 
According to the blockchain intelligence firm, Chainalysis, MTI was the biggest crypto scam in 2020 which netted more than $500 million for the scheme’s masterminds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Users will now be able to use the payment service to instantly support content sources using Bitcoin without registering an account.
Mash, a monetization service powered by Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, has announced that people will no longer have to create an account on the service in order to utilize it.
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, “We’ve extended a large number of our widgets to allow users to donate and spend without creating an account on Mash. You have the additional option to scan and contribute with another lightning wallet for a donation, to purchase something and more. You can use any lightning powered wallet including CashApp, Strike, Blue Wallet, Breeze and XX.” 
 
         
         
         
         
    
Anyone can now go to sites that have Mash integrated and utilize the feature, by selecting "pay with another lightning wallet," scanning with a Lightning wallet, and then confirming the transaction.
The feature has also been extended to the Mash button so that you can donate easily without being logged in.
“There are multiple options immediately available, including a regular Lightning invoice, LN-URL QR code that you can and choose the amount in the other wallet, and a Lightning address that all creators and builders get,” describes the release.
Some of the benefits of integrating with Mash, according to the release, include one-click boosts and payments, a fluid mobile experience and auto-contributions.]]></summary>
