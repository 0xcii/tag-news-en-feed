Polygon CEO Claims Layer 3 Devalues Ethereum

As a result, Boiron believes that layer 3 is not required to scale Ethereum. Since L3 networks are not required to scale current networks, Boiton has declared that Polygon Labs will not operate on the networks.

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tether-8888-btc-600-million-bitcoin-treasury-on-chain-data"/>
        <updated>2024-04-01T10:53:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stablecoin issuer Tether has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 8,888 BTC worth around $600 million. This latest purchase was revealed through on-chain data rather than an official announcement.
Tether has not publicly disclosed its Bitcoin addresses. However, transactions tracked on the blockchain show 8,888 BTC were recently sent from the crypto exchange Bitfinex to an undisclosed Tether wallet.
The recipient address now holds over 75,000 BTC worth $5.3 billion. In May 2023, Tether first revealed it was allocating a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin, with plans to invest up to 15% of quarterly profits.
"The decision to invest in bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset," Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, said in the statement when they announced their Bitcoin strategy.
While unconfirmed, analysts believe the identified wallet likely belongs to Tether. The amount perfectly matches its pledged buying strategy and claimed holdings in its latest financial reports.
Tether has emerged as a major player in Bitcoin markets and its accumulation race. The company is now estimated to be the seventh largest holder of BTC. Its steady purchases, combined with those of institutional investors like MicroStrategy, tighten supply.
Critics have raised concerns about Tether's lack of transparency and the potential market risks of its growing bitcoin stash. However, its embrace of Bitcoin also shows the asset's broadening mainstream acceptance.
Tether aims to capitalize on Bitcoin's growth while diversifying its reserves away from traditional assets like government debt. Tether is one of the world's largest holders of U.S. Treasuries. 
This latest $600 million acquisition is unlikely to be Tether's last. As the stablecoin leader continues executing its Bitcoin investment strategy, its influence over Bitcoin markets is only set to increase.]]></summary>

While the price recently surpassed its November 2021 peak, the true story might lie beneath the surface – a record-breaking surge in hashrate, the computational power securing the network. This unexpected development has analysts buzzing about potential bullish signals for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.
 
 
The hashrate, essentially the combined processing power of Bitcoin miners globally, has doubled in the past year. This stands in stark contrast to the price action, which has only marginally surpassed its previous all-time high.

This speculation comes in the wake of a divergent decision in the Coinbase vs. SEC lawsuit, where the SEC secured a pivotal victory, challenging the notion that digital assets can skirt securities laws—a decision that may have far-reaching consequences for the crypto industry at large.
 
Ripple Ruling To Be Overturned?
