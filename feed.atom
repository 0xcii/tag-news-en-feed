        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the midst of a tumultuous week, First Republic Bank is struggling to regain its footing in the financial world. Reports have surfaced that the bank is poised to enter government receivership due to a massive outflow of $100 billion in customer withdrawals last month. This has prompted investors to flee the bank, causing its shares to dive-bomb by over 50% on Tuesday.

The situation only worsened as pre-market trading began, and by 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday, First Republic Bank’s shares had fallen by over 30%.

Bitcoin Active Addresses Have Observed Constant Growth Recently
 
As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, there were concerns in February that the metric hadn’t been displaying any significant growth.

Naturally, this metric accounts for both senders and receivers in this measurement.

Recently, the country’s efforts have cleared their first hurdle as the National Assembly passed the first phase of the review of the cryptocurrency bill.
 
However, this is not the end of the process, as the Legislation and Judiciary Committee will still need to approve the bill. Assuming it gets the Committee’s nod, it will proceed to the final stage of approval, which is likely to happen later this year.
 
Once the bill becomes law, it will bring clarity and consistency to the country’s cryptocurrency market, which has been operating in a largely unregulated environment so far.

        <updated>2023-04-26T16:07:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano was one of Wednesday’s big movers, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. Spurred by an apparent collapse of First Republic Bank, the global crypto market cap moved 7% higher, as of writing. Solana was also in the green, rising by nearly 9%.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) rose by as much as 9% on Wednesday, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets.
 
Following a low of $0.38 on Tuesday, ADA/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4166 earlier in today’s session.
 
Today’s surge in price saw cardano climb to its highest point in six days, since when the token was trading above a ceiling at $0.4200.
 
 
Looking at the chart, Wednesday’s move came as the relative strength index (RSI) broke free of a resistance level at 53.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 55.12, with an upcoming ceiling of 58.00 a potential target for bulls.
 
Should this point be hit, there is a strong possibility that ADA will move back above its aforementioned point of resistance.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Additionally solana (SOL) was another notable mover on Wednesday, as the token was also nearly 9% higher.
 
SOL/USD rose to a peak of $22.92 earlier in the day, after almost breaking out of a floor at $20.00 the day prior.
 
As a result of today’s gains, solana is now on the cusp of colliding with its long-term ceiling at $23.00.
 
 
Although the RSI has risen above a ceiling at 50.00 in today’s session, it will need to move beyond the 55.00 mark in order to reach the above target.
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 52.97, with solana now trading at the $22.71 mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
