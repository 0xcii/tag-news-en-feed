Dogecoin Miners Sell $53 Million Worth Of Coins
 
The Dogecoin miner reserves saw a significant drop between August and October which suggests that this holder cohort is beginning to sell. And given the fact that DOGE miners are some of the largest holders, their selling can signal doom for the cryptocurrency.
 
 
As data from IntoTheBlock shows, Dogecoin miner numbers dropped from 4.67 billion DOGE to 4.35 billion DOGE. This means that between August and October, these miners reduced their balances by around 320 million. …]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-09T18:37:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain sleuths spotted the Ethereum Foundation trading 1,700 ETH for a hefty $2.76 million in USDC stablecoins. This comes hot on the heels of Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, transferring a cool $3.79 million in ether within a mere ten days.
 
Ethereum Foundation Parts With Ethereum in $2.76 Million Stablecoin Deal
 
Through the decentralized platform, Uniswap, the Ethereum Foundation executed the 1,700 ETH for $2.76 million USDC swap. Eagle-eyed observers and the sharp team at Scopescan didn’t miss a beat. “The Ethereum Foundation has just sold 1.7K ETH ($2.76M) for USDC,” announced Scopescan at a bright and early 4:25 a.m. Eastern Time on Monday. Naturally, this stirred some buzz in the crypto sphere.
 
“Ethereum Foundation sold 1,700 ETH for $2.7 million because: They are paying to their workers. They are building new projects. They’re supporting new devs and projects. Don’t panic,” advised a fervent ether enthusiast.
 
This transaction trails Buterin’s recent move of shipping $3.79 million in ether to centralized platforms within a span of ten days. Data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that the Ethereum Foundation’s coffers still boast a staggering 316,761 ether, valued at a whopping $501 million. Additionally, they’re sitting on a nest egg of around $49 million in wrapped ether (WETH).
 
 
Historically, the Ethereum Foundation has been transparent with its finances, releasing periodic reports. It’s anticipated that this latest trade might feature in their upcoming disclosure. Today, ETH’s value dipped by over 3%, seemingly influenced by tensions arising from the Israel-Hamas strife. The crypto giant, second only in market cap, has seen its value slide below the $1,600 mark, currently trading at $1,578 per token.

In a tweet, Hoskinson declared, “Looking at Michael Lewis’s dumpster fire of a book, there seems to be a group of people in the elite circles who desperately want to somehow get a public exoneration for SBF.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was a notable mover on Monday, as the meme coin fell by as much as 5% to start the week. Today’s decline comes as traders moved away from high-risk assets, in favor of safe-havens like gold. XRP also dropped in today’s session, hitting a three-week low in the process.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) fell to a multi-month low to start the week, as markets slipped due to growing tensions in the Middle East.
 
SHIB/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.000006894 on Monday, less than 24 hours after price peaked at $0.000007221.
 
Today’s decline saw the meme coin fall to its weakest point since June 16, which is the last time the cryptocurrency slipped below a floor at $0.00000690.
 
 
The relative strength index (RSI) also dropped below a support point of its own at the 37.00 mark.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 34.90, and appears to be moving towards the 30.00 region.
 
Should it drop below this point, SHIB will enter the oversold zone, which could then prompt bulls to potentially buy the dip.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was another notable mover on Monday, falling by over 4% in today’s session.
 
After reaching a high of $0.5218 on Sunday, XRP/USD plunged to a bottom at $0.4975 earlier in the day.
 
This resulted in the world’s fifth largest cryptocurrency moving to its weakest point since September 18.
 
 
Monday’s move occurred as the RSI retreated towards a support level at the 43.00 mark for the first time in three weeks.
 
As of writing, the index is now at a reading of 43.60, with ripple trading at $0.5014, following a three-day losing streak.
 
In the event that the RSI falls under 43.00, XRP will likely edge below $0.5000 in the upcoming days.
