judgment in a Texas federal court. 
Lejilex, which is part of the Crypto Freedom Alliance of  
Texas, filed its brief on October 3. The company argues that it intends to  
facilitate crypto transactions and not to sell securities. In its filing,  
Lejilex accuses the SEC of overstepping its regulatory authority. 
SEC Defends Stance on Securities
In its brief, Lejilex contends that the SEC seeks to broadly  
classify asset sales as security transactions. The company claims that the SEC  
has maintained an approach that allows for a "transformative  
expansion" of its reg…]]></summary>

The specific grounds of the SEC’s appeal remain undisclosed so far, leaving the XRP community in the dark. However, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has clarified via X that the secondary market status of XRP, e.g. its sale on crypto exchanges in the US, is not up for debate.
 
XRP Status On Secondary Market Is Safe
 
Morgan highlights the distinction between different types of sales, emphasizing the nature of those that were contested in court. “There is some confusion in this matter about the issue of secondary sales,” Morgan notes on X, explaining, “Some people treat Ripple’s sales by the programmatic means to retail investors via excha…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Has Plunged As Short-Term Holders Have Been Realizing Gains
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the short-term holders have started taking profits again recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Realized Profit/Loss Ratio,” which, as its name implies, tells us about how the profit and the loss volumes being moved by Bitcoin investors currently compare.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average holder on the network is moving their coins at a net profit. On the other hand, the indicator being under this threshold suggests loss-taking is the dominant form of selling in the market.

The broader crypto market, alongside traditional markets, has been experiencing heightened volatility, driven by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.

Amid this turbulence, many analysts focus on Bitcoin’s growing correlation with Gold as a key metric to watch. BTC, often called “digital gold,” has been showing an increasingly strong connection to the precious metal, especially in times of uncertainty.

This ruling also brings back on track Terpin’s lawsuit against the telecom company, and consequently, underlines important issues involving the different roles of telcos in protecting customer information.
