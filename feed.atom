        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, large Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin reported a significant security breach resulting in the loss of 4,502.9 BTC, currently valued at over $300 million. The incident occurred at approximately 1:26 p.m. and involved unauthorized access to the exchange's wallet.
In an official statement, DMM Bitcoin said that measures have been taken to prevent further unauthorized access by imposing restrictions on certain services in attempt to enhance security. These restrictions include suspending new account openings, processing cryptocurrency withdrawals, and accepting new buying orders for spot trading. However, existing limit orders and withdrawals of Japanese Yen may experience delays.
DMM Bitcoin said that it is committed to fully guaranteeing all customer Bitcoin deposits. "Please rest assured that all of your Bitcoin (BTC) deposits will be fully guaranteed as we will procure the equivalent amount of BTC that was leaked with support from our group companies," the announcement stated.
The exchange says they "deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused to our customers," and is actively investigating the details of the breach. DMM Bitcoin says it will provide updates as more information becomes available. 
For further inquiries and affected customers are encouraged to visit the DMM Bitcoin customer support page.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Charlie Shrem, once a rising star in the Bitcoin world, became the first prominent figure to face imprisonment due to his involvement in cryptocurrency. As the founder of BitInstant, one of the earliest and most influential Bitcoin exchanges, Shrem played a pivotal role in the early adoption of Bitcoin. However, his arrest in 2014 for money laundering linked to Silk Road transactions marked a significant turning point. 

The Rise of BitInstant
Charlie Shrem discovered Bitcoin during his senior year of college and quickly saw its potential as a revolutionary form of money that promised personal freedom, autonomy, and privacy. In 2011, he co-founded BitInstant with Gareth Nelson, creating a platform that made it easier for people to buy and sell Bitcoin during a time when such transactions w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, the Supreme Court of the United States issued two important cases which will likely have wide ranging impacts for Bitcoin and crypto. The decisions are National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo (NRA) and Cantero, et al. v. Bank of America, N. A. (Cantero).
In NRA, the Court addressed a critical issue impacting not only traditional advocacy groups but any disfavored, but legal, industry. This ruling draws parallels to Operation Choke Point 2.0, where U.S. regulators have allegedly been targeting crypto businesses through financial exclusion. Moreover, the recent Cantero decision sheds light on how this legal framework might impact Custodia Bank's appeal against the denial of their master account by the Federal Reserve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a blog post, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revisited the pivotal Bitcoin block size debate that starkly divided the Bitcoin community mainly from 2015 to 2017. Engaging deeply with two authoritative books, Buterin re-examined the historical nuances of this schism from his unique perspective as both a participant and a thought leader in the crypto space.
 
Buterin’s blog entry, entitled “Some reflections on the Bitcoin block size war,” unpacks the contrasting narratives provided by Jonathan Bier’s The Blocksize War and Roger Ver and Steve Patterson’s Hijacking Bitcoin. These books represent the pro-small-block and pro-big-block viewpoints, respectively, offering a lens into the ideological and technical divides that characterized the debate.

JUST IN: Legendary Trader Peter Brandt predicts the #Bitcoin price to rise 230% against Gold.

Brandt has over 50 years of trading experience and correctly called Bitcoin's parabolic bull market in 2017. His latest forecast says the bitcoin-to-gold ratio could reach 100 ounces after a consolidation period.
The veteran trader tweeted, "Since its inception, Bitcoin $BTC has gained against Gold. This chart shows the # oz. of $GC_F to buy one BTC. The ratio should chop for another 12 to 18 months -- then advance to 100 oz of GC to buy a BTC."

Currently, the BTC/GLD ratio sits around 29, meaning it takes 29 ounces of gold worth $68,000 to purchase one Bitcoin. But Brandt expects this ratio to triple to 100 ounces after Bitcoin's next consolidation phase ends.
At today's gold prices, 100 ounces would make one bitcoin worth over $234,000 - representing a 230% price increase.
Brandt has long been bullish on Bitcoin versus Gold. Since its creation in 2009, Bitcoin has massively outperformed the traditional haven asset, gaining over 375,000% against Gold in that time span.
The trader believes Bitcoin still has ample room to run versus Gold despite already seeing such enormous relative gains. The BTC/GLD ratio chart shows Bitcoin's long-term uptrend against Gold with room to advance.
Brandt expects Bitcoin to continue significantly outshining Gold in the years ahead. With the approval and successful launch of the US Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year, its reputation as a digital store of value continues to grow among institutions.]]></summary>
