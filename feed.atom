Japan was among over 100 affiliated entities included in the bankruptcy

Asset Segregation Raises Recovery Hopes
In contrast to its parent company, FTX Japan reported having  
more assets than liabilities, with approximately $134 million in user assets  
segregated from FTX Trading. This distinction raised hopes for the potential  
recovery of funds belonging to Japanese customers.
Bitcoin.com News reported over a year and five months ago

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin miners, the backbone of the world’s largest cryptocurrency, are experiencing a dramatic shift in their behavior. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a surprising trend: miner reserves have sunk to their lowest level in 14 years, raising concerns about the future of Bitcoin mining. However, a closer look suggests this might be a case of shrewd adaptation rather than a mass exodus.
 
 
Halving Headaches: Balancing Rewards And Risk
 
The culprit behind this shift is the recent Bitcoin halving event in April 2024. Roughly every four years, the number of Bitcoins awarded to miners for validating transactions is cut in half. This time around, the reward dropped from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. While this might seem like a minor decrease, it significantly impacts miner profitability.

“According to the Freedom in the World report, we have the very unfortunate label of being the country that over the last year has lost the most freedoms,” Maradiaga told Bitcoin Magazine.
“Imagine a country in which you could go to prison for raising the national flag, for tweeting, for receiving a remittance from an international donor or for expressing your opinions on social media,” he added.
“That's the situation in Nicaragua.”
