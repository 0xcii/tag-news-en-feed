        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin investors have recently seen the crypto stalling at the $0.2 mark as bullish sentiment amongst whales and other traders starts to falter. Interestingly, DOGE has yet to have a tangible breakout above the $0.2 mark since March 31. In fact, the crypto went on a decline in the first week of April to reach as low as $0.1719. 
 
Despite having reversed some of this decline at the time of writing, Dogecoin has yet to perform as many investors would expect. Furthermore, chart formation shows the cryptocurrency could be stuck in a bearish pattern and on-chain data indicates whales are selling their DOGE holdings. At the same time, short-term holders have seen their holdings increase, which makes them vulnerable to selloffs.
