A recent theory proposed by crypto researcher @BoringSleuth suggests that the elusive Ryoshi might be a combination of two individuals: Ryo Suzuki and Tsuyoshi Maruyama, both of whom have ties to the B2C2 Group.
 
“@BoringSleuth” tweeted, “Who do I believe Ryoshi, the anonymous Founder of $SHIB is? I believe it is a combo of 2 people: Ryo Suzuki & Tsuyoshi Maruyama – Both Advisors to B2C2 Group.” The researcher further pointed out a curious coincidence: “Ryo Suzuki resigned as an advisor from B2C2 Group on 4/27/21, the exact same day Tsuyoshi Maruyama was appointed as an advisor for B2C2 Group.”
