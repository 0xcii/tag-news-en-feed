As of January 17, FTX’s crypto holdings were estimated to include $685 million in locked Solana (SOL) tokens, $529 million in FTT tokens, $268 million in Bitcoin (BTC), $90 million in Ethereum (ETH), and various other assets including Aptos ($67 million), Dogecoin ($42 million), Polygon ($39 million), XRP ($29 million), and stablecoins. An additional $1.2 billion is held in crypto on third-party exchanges.
