Bitcoin Transaction Fees Has Observed A Sharp Increase Recently
 
As explained by analyst James V. Straten in a post on X, the Bitcoin fees have been greater than Ethereum’s recently.

The total fees earned by the validators in a single day depend on the blockchain conditions on that day. Whenever the network is congested (that is, a large amount of users are making transfers at once), the fees can spike up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitwise, the aspiring applicant for a spot Bitcoin ETF, has unveiled a captivating commercial aimed at advocating for it's upcoming Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
"A word to the wise, from a man of few words. #bitcoinisinteresting", Bitwise said.



The commercial, appears to be targeted towards the older generations like gen X and baby boomers, with a classy and sophisticated style that those generations are used to watching on the television in between their favorite shows and sports. "You know what's interesting these days? Bitcoin," said the actor in the commercial. "Look for Bitwise, my friends."
This release arrives at a interesting moment as the SEC continues to evaluate numerous applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitwise, along with several other financial firms, has persistently pursued the establishment of a spot Bitcoin ETF, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning Bitcoin market.
While the commercial aims to familiarize a wider audience with the concept of a spot Bitcoin ETF, it is also helping garner support for their application, potentially influencing public opinion and regulatory decisions regarding Bitcoin investment vehicles.
Bitwise remains hopeful that this latest promotional effort will contribute positively to the ongoing discourse surrounding the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, potentially marking a significant milestone in the adoption of Bitcoin within traditional investment portfolios.]]></summary>

While many people may feel like they are too late (why didn’t I buy it under $100?), like they missed the opportunity, it has likely never been a better time to jump in. More specifically, the ratio of potential rewards compared to the risks behind Bitcoin has never been more attractive. Demand, supply, awareness, narrative, fundamentals; all stars seem to align to give us a memorable year 2024.

The project which was titled BELLS was Markus’s brainchild before the idea for Dogecoin was born. However, he had abandoned the project and had not said anything about it until now.
 
The Resurrection Of BELLS Blockchain
 
Adam McBride took to X (formerly Twitter) last week to share a recent find that was connected to one of the Dogecoin founders, Bill Markus. According to McBride, the BELLS token was founded by Markus in 2013 but was abandoned. Following the 10th anniversary of DOGE when Markus talked about the beginning of Dogecoin, the crypto enthusiast had gone hunting for Markus’s other crypto project and they found it.

The surge is a response to the real estate market's upheaval, compelling investors to pivot their portfolios toward the better opportunities presented by Bitcoin. Leon Wankum, a Bitcoin expert specializing in real estate, explained, "Bitcoin, as an emerging asset class, potentially offers much higher growth potential for many investors, while the real estate market is in crisis and demand has died down."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto exchange platform OKX launched OKX  
Futures on December 15, 2023. This move, aimed at refining its derivatives  
trading platform, promised to streamline the exchange's offerings.
OKX's overhaul introduces two essential changes:  
Perpetual Futures, replacing the former Perpetual Swap Contracts, and Expiry  
Futures, formerly known as Future Contracts. 
According to the company, while these updates  
rebrand existing instruments, OKX has assured traders of continued access to  
familiar functionalities and trading pairs. Notably, OKX has revamped its interface within the  
futures trading section. The design aims to simplify navigation, providing  
traders with a more intuitive and accessible trading platform.
Transition and Market Adjustment Plans
Traders can transition to OKX Futures by accessing  
the Futures Trading option through the web and app (version 6.46.0) starting  
December 15, the company noted. While the trading process remains consistent, the updated naming  
convention aims to provide a more streamlined experience for users.
To maintain stability, OKX plans to ensure that there is no alteration to  
API parameters, which is crucial for automated trading systems. This  
decision aims to facilitate uninterrupted,  
efficient trading experiences for users relying on automation.
In a parallel initiative, OKX has scheduled an  
adjustment to position tiers of perpetual swaps and futures on December 18,  
aiming to fortify market liquidity and mitigate risks.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves...
