Bijan Alizadehfard described the collaboration with Microbt as a reflection of his company’s “strategic foresight.”
 
Microbt to Integrate Hydro-Cooling Miners
 
Phoenix Group PLC, a bitcoin mining company based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has signed an order worth more than $380 million with Microbt, a mining rig manufacturer. As part of the agreement, Phoenix Group PLC will receive mining equipment valued at $136 million, with an additional option worth $246 million.
 
The UAE-based bitcoin miner is also collaborating with Microbt to integrate hydro-cooling miners, which is a significant milestone towards Phoenix Group’s goal of creating High-Performance Computing (HPC) data centers. Bijan Alizadehfard, the co-founder and CEO of Phoenix Group PLC, described the collaboration with Microbt as a reflection of his company’s strategic foresight.
 
“This collaboration with Whatsminer [Microbt] is a milestone for Phoenix Group, reflecting our strategic foresight and commitment to pioneering in the tech industry. Our successful listing on the ADX has further empowered us to pursue such significant partnerships, enhancing our capabilities in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector,” Alizadehfard said.
 
 
Phoenix Group has announced a multi-million dollar deal with Microbt, coming just days after its highly successful initial public offering (IPO) which raised over $370 million.
 
The oversubscribed IPO and the deal with Microbt both signal a new era of growth and innovation for the UAE company. Phoenix Group PLC aims to leverage these advancements to reinforce its position as a leader in the global technology industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance, the largest crypto exchange in terms of trading volume, has withdrawn its bid for a collective investment fund applied with the financial market regulator in Abu Dhabi. The decision came as, according to Binance, it is reassessing its “global licensing needs.  

Is Binance Rethinking Its MENA Strategy?  

As seen on the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) register, Binance’s local subsidiary, BV Investment Management Limited, applied for the license on 15 November 2022 and withdrew the application on 7 November 2023. The license would have enabled the exchange to offer services to professional clients.  

Notably, during those decisions, Changpeng Zhao was still heading Binance as the CEO. Zhao stepped down last month, following his plea agreement with the US prosecutors, handing over …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, the founder of Binance, has recently grappled with significant legal hurdles in the U.S. His guilty plea in a notable case led a Seattle federal judge to impose movement restrictions on him.
 
Former Binance Boss CZ Restricted to U.S. Soil
 
As the pivotal figure of Binance, CZ admitted guilt for not establishing anti-money laundering measures and breaching U.S. sanctions. His plea, which included resigning as the CEO, brought considerable repercussions for both him and the crypto exchange firm.
 
U.S. District Judge Richard Jones, on Thursday, reversed a previous ruling that would have permitted Zhao to travel back to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Pointing to Zhao’s substantial assets and weak connections to the U.S., Judge Jones highlighted the flight risk he poses. This decision came after Jones consented to the plea agreement between the U.S. authorities and CZ, amid Binance’s settlement process.
 
Judge Jones expressed that the court wasn’t persuaded by assurances that CZ wouldn’t flee if allowed to go to the UAE, a country with which the U.S. lacks an extradition agreement. Consequently, he ordered CZ to remain within the mainland U.S. until his sentencing in February 2024. CZ could face up to 18 months in prison for these offenses.
 
 
Many speculate that CZ might avoid jail time, akin to Arthur Hayes, the ex-CEO of Bitmex. Hayes received a sentence of six months of house arrest and two years probation for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by not instituting an anti-money laundering (AML) system at Bitmex. Although Hayes faced a potential prison sentence, his guilty plea and the settlement of fines helped him evade incarceration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, must stay in the United States until his sentencing is scheduled in February, a US federal judge ruled on Thursday. The decision overruled Zhao's previous bail agreement that allowed him to visit his UAE residency but needed him to return to the US two weeks before his sentencing.  

The ruling came only a day after the court accepted Zhao's guilty plea for violating one count of one count of Bank Secrecy Act violation.  

Bail Agreement Does not Guarantee Free Movement  

Zhao entered the guilty plea last month and consecutively signed a $175 million bond agreement. He already put up about $15 million in an escrow account and found guarantors for the additional funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has warned that a soft landing for the U.S. economy is a fantasy, emphasizing that a crash landing is more likely. Noting that he already warned of this giant crash in his Rich Dad’s Prophecy book, the famous author stressed: “This next crash may turn into a depression.”
 
Robert Kiyosaki on Giant Crash and a Depression
 
The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has once again sounded the alarm about the U.S. economy. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.
 
Kiyosaki wrote on social media platform X Wednesday: “Soft landing is a fantasy. Crash landing more likely. I warned of this giant crash in my book Rich Dad’s Prophecy pub 2012.” He continued:
 

This next crash may turn into a depression.
 
The renowned author also shared in an X post on Sunday that the Israel-Hamas war has motivated him to buy an electric vehicle. “The war is about oil,” he said. “Higher gas prices will make the poor poorer.” He proceeded to reiterate his recommendation of buying gold, silver, and bitcoin, which he believes to be the best investment for unstable times.
 
 
The well-known author has repeatedly expressed concerns about challenging times ahead for the U.S. economy. Last week, he similarly cautioned about a possible next Great Depression and a war, predicting “really hard times ahead” for millions of people. Kiyosaki also previously warned of the “greatest real estate crash ever,” emphasizing that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes will also crash stocks, bonds, and the U.S. dollar.

As pointed out by analyst Ali in a new post on X, the BTC miner reserve has plunged during the last day. The “miner reserve” here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin that the miners as a whole are carrying in their wallets right now.
 
When the value of this metric declines, it means that the miners are taking out a net number of coins from their wallets. Generally, the main reason why these chain validators would withdraw from their reserve is for selling purposes, so this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the price.
