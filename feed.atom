        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The largest virtual bank in Hong Kong, ZA Bank, broke new ground earlier today by offering exclusive reserve bank services to stablecoin issuers, a move in line with Hong Kong’s recent regulatory advancements in cryptocurrency.
 
This initiative is part of the territory’s new stablecoin licensing regime, which requires crypto stablecoin operators to deposit reserve assets with local banks.
 
Notably, this rule appears to “strengthen the stability” and “security” of cryptocurrency in the region. It also reflects a general trend that fintech innovation continues to be interwoven with more traditional financial regulation.

Despite the recent contraction forcing the world’s most valuable coin to spot rates, exciting trends are developing, pointing to confidence, especially among whales.
 
Whales Rapidly Accumulating Bitcoin
 
According to the IntoTheBlock data on July 19, whales are doubling down. As data shows, the number of addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC are rapidly buying, scooping more coins and pushing the figure to a two-year high. This swell in buying pressure means that whales, mainly comprising institutions and deep-pocketed investors, are confident of Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.

Regarded as an “emergency” measure, the sales had a connection to a continuing criminal probe. But both politicians and business executives have expressed strong disagreement and disapproval over the extensive liquidation.
 
The government promised that the sales were carried out in a way that supported the market, yet during the sale period, the value of Bitcoin fell by more than 22%, from $65,695 to $53,717.
 
Even with the purported prudence, many have begun to doubt the actual market impact of such a big sell-off in light of the recent precipitous decrease.

On July 17, 2024, a well-known community member by the name labib_co shib, known as Labib, started the proposal.
 
Can The Shiba Inu Army Convince Binance?
 
The petition outlines the Shiba Inu community’s unequivocal request to Binance to implement a token burn mechanism, which would systematically remove 1% of SHIB tokens used in daily exchange transactions. The petition states that the goal of this burn is to decrease the amount of SHIB in circulation, which could raise the token’s scarcity and value.
