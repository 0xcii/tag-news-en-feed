years, cryptocurrency, a digital form of currency that runs independently of  
central banks, has received a lot of attention and appeal. While the impact of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rise of  
cryptocurrencies in recent years has resulted in the emergence of novel  
financial services that use the potential of digital assets. Crypto-backed  
loans, which allow individuals to unlock the value of their cryptocurrencies  
without having to sell them, are one such business that is growing popularity. 
These loans are  
made possible through lending platforms, which connect borrowers and lenders in  
a decentralized fashion. This article delves into the concept of crypto-backed  
loans, their advantages, and how lending platforms are changing the financial  
environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin remained close to the $31,000 level on Friday, as momentum in the market continued to be bullish heading into the weekend. This comes ahead of the anticipated consumer sentiment report from the United States, which is expected to show an increase in overall consumer confidence. Ethereum also edged higher today, climbing above $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) remained close to $31,000 in today’s session, as traders prepared for the consumer sentiment report from the United States.
 
After dropping to a low of $30,273.22 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $31,256.86 earlier today.
 
As a result of the move, bitcoin neared a recent one-year high at $31,443, which was last Friday’s high.

Friday’s surge also led to a breakout of a key price ceiling at $30,800.
 
This appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI) running into its own resistance level at the 70.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $30,831.12.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) climbed above the $1,900 mark earlier in the day, however traders have already moved to consolidate gains.
 
ETH/USD briefly rose to an intraday high of $1,906.37 on Friday, but has since tailed off, and is now trading at $1,891.36.
 
Friday’s peak saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency come close to a collision with the resistance level at $1,910.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Looking at the chart, the RSI also neared a ceiling of its own, as it approached the 58.00 point of resistance.
 
In the event this level is broken, there is a strong possibility that ethereum could move beyond $1,930.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bill that aims to regulate cryptocurrencies and  
stablecoins in the UK has been approved by King Charles. Dubbed the Financial  
Services and Markets Act 2023, the new law classifies the trading of

of payment rules.
The Financial Services

including the digital assets. The bill, which got the approval of the upper house  
last week, permits the regulators, including the Financial

The law has been enacted as a response to a series of scandals that rocked the crypto market, including the implosion of coins created by Korean tech entrepreneur Do Kwon that aggravated a $2 trillion crypto-market downturn.
 
The landmark legislation, approved on Friday, is South Korea’s first comprehensive crypto regulation framework. It was formulated by integrating 19 pre-existing crypto-related bills. The law formally characterizes digital assets and sets out punitive measures for various offenses, including insider trading, market manipulation, and illicit trading practices.
