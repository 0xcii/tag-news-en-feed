        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the cryptocurrency industry has been on regulators’ radar over the past years, including major exchanges like Binance, the most targeted aspect is stablecoins. Following the recent saga between Paxos, the issuer of the Binance branded stablecoin BUSD, and the Security Exchange Commission (SEC), the stablecoin market has been bewildered. Investors sought the safest-backed stablecoin to save their funds. 
 
According to Binance Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as “CZ,”  the cryptocurrency industry may soon evolve away from the ubiquitous dollar-backed stablecoin era to stablecoins that are algorithmically backed by other assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Blur non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace launched its native token this week, and users who were awarded token allotments received “care packages.” Blur tokens began trading at noon on Feb. 14, reaching a high of $5.02 per token. However, the coin has since dropped more than 85% against the U.S. dollar.
 
BLUR Token Launch Records an 85% Drop on Its First Day of Trading
 
On Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2023, which is Valentine’s Day, the NFT marketplace Blur announced the launch of its token and airdrop. Blur gave away “care packages” to users who conducted trades on a competing NFT market, listed NFTs on the Blur marketplace, and those who participated in Blur market bidding, according to the allotment cycles.
 
“It’s time for BLUR,” the market tweeted the day prior. “Care Packages can be opened on Feb 14 at 12PM EST, 1AM HKG, 6PM CET. Make sure the launch announcement comes from our official Blur.io account tomorrow and double check all URLs before claiming.”
 
 
BLUR has started trading, with Kucoin being the most active exchange on Tuesday, and the most active trading pair being BLUR/USDT. As of 2:05 p.m. (ET), BLUR had a market capitalization of approximately $176 million, with a global trade volume of about $12 million. At 2:10 p.m., BLUR dropped to $0.458 per coin, and statistics indicate that there are 360,000,000 BLUR tokens in circulation.
 
 
As of 2:10 p.m. (ET) on Tuesday, there were 8,798 unique addresses holding BLUR tokens, with approximately 18,900 transfers having taken place. The Blur marketplace has emerged as a top NFT market in recent months, competing with Opensea, the largest NFT market.
 
However, Looksrare, another competing NFT market, also garnered attention with an airdrop of its market’s token called LOOKS, but volumes have subsided since then. By 2:33 p.m. on Tuesday, BLUR rebounded and hit the $0.602 per unit range.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-sol-rebounds-trx-up-for-fifth-straight-session/"/>
        <updated>2023-02-14T16:42:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana was one of Tuesday’s notable movers, as the token rebounded from losses to start the week. The move comes despite U.S. inflation figures missing expectations. Consumer prices came in at 6.4%, higher than the 6.2% many had forecasted. Tron rose for a fifth consecutive session on Tuesday.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rose by as much as 5% on Tuesday, as prices climbed back above a recent support level.
 
SOL/USD surged to an intraday high of $21.70 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after trading at a bottom of $19.87.
 
Today’s move saw the token reenter its $20.00 price floor, after a failed breakout attempt to start the week.
 
 
Recent momentum in solana has been largely bearish, and comes following a downwards crossover of the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
However, bulls have moved to halt any further sell-offs, as the relative strength index (RSI) maintained a floor at 42.00
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 47.46, with the 50.00 mark the next visible point of resistance.
 
 
Tron (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) climbed higher for a fifth straight session on Tuesday, breaking out of a recent ceiling in the process.
 
Following a low of $0.06414 to start the week, TRX/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.06638 earlier in the day.
 
Tuesday’s surge pushed tron to its highest point since last Thursday, which comes after prices broke out of a ceiling at $0.06565.
 
 
Looking at the chart, overall sentiment in TRX has largely been bullish in recent weeks, with moving averages trending upwards.
 
This may be tested in upcoming days, with the RSI, which is currently tracking at 61.53, edging close to a ceiling at 63.00.
 
Previous bulls could look to secure gains as we approach this point, in turn giving way for sellers to re-enter the market.
