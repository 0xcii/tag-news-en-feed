Following a high of $0.3218 on Friday, ADA/USD slipped to a bottom at $0.2304 to start the weekend.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) plunged below a floor at the 30.00 mark, entering oversold territory.
 
At the time of writing, the index is currently tracking at 17.75.
 
ADA is currently trading at $0.2509, down 22% from yesterday’s peak.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Additionally, polygon (MATIC) lost a significant amount of its value to start the weekend, nearing a one-year low in the process.
 
MATIC/USD sank to a bottom at $0.5605 on Saturday, as prices dropped by nearly 30% from yesterday’s high.
 
As a result of this decline, the world’s twelfth-largest cryptocurrency moved to its lowest point since last July.
 
 
Overall, the token is now down close to 40% in the last seven-days, after breaking out of a support point at $0.75.
 
This has also led to the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) extending a downwards crossover versus the 25-day (blue) MA.
 
Price strength is also deeply oversold with a reading of 16.22, which is an all-time low point.
