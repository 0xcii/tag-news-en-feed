        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana surged 10% on June 29, after it was confirmed that a new cross-chain bridge will allow users easier access to other blockchains. The update from Debridge will reportedly enable solana users to access ethereum’s virtual machine for the first time. Bitcoin cash extended its own gains on Thursday.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was a notable mover in today’s session, as the price rose by over 10%.
 
Following a low of $15.75 during Wednesday’s session, SOL/USD jumped to a peak of $18.20 earlier in the day.
 
This resulted in the world’s ninth largest cryptocurrency climbing to its highest point in the past 20 days.
 
 
As a result of the rally, the 10-day (red) moving average is now on the cusp of an upward crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) appears to be nearing a breakout of a resistance point around the 51.00 level.
 
The index is currently tracking at 50.87, with SOL at $17.35, after giving up earlier gains.
 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was in the green on Thursday, racing to a fresh multi-month high in the process.
 
BCH/USD surged to an intraday high of $247.64 earlier in the day, a day after dropping to a bottom at $223.50.
 
As a result of this latest rally, BCH moved to its strongest point since May 11 last year, when price peaked at $249.00.
 
 
This latest move comes as the RSI once again broke out of a ceiling at the 80.00 level, after dropping below this point the day prior.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 81.72, which remains deep in overbought territory, and could prompt bears to reenter the market.
 
Despite this, traders will likely attempt to reach a target at $250.00 first, before any inevitable sell-offs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency  
exchange Coinbase has filed its first legal response to the Securities  
and Exchange Commission's (SEC) allegations, saying the claims “lack all  
merit.” It also argued that were SEC’s assertion of regulatory power over its cryptocurrency  
services correct, the watchdog’s action violates its “due process rights and  
constitutes an extraordinary abuse of process.”
Coinbase  
Slams SEC over ‘Securities’ Claims
In early  
June, the SEC filed a lawsuit against  
Coinbase, alleging  
that the largest crypto exchange in the United States, is operating with an  
unauthorized trading platform and offers unregistered securities. The financial  
watchdog also accused Coinbase of running a digital asset staking-as-a-service  
programme without permission. 
However, in  
its 177-page-long response submitted to the district court  
in New York yesterday (Wednesday), Coinbase  
said it is not and has never been a securities exchange, broker or clearing  
agency.  It also argued that cryptocurrencies traded on its platform fall  
outside the SEC’s authority because they are not ‘investment contracts’ or assets  
pooled from investors to engage in businesses and pay them with profits. Without  
this obligation, Coinbase’s listed crypto are not ‘securities’ but ‘just an  
asset sale,’ the exchange contended.

Each ruling has the potential to influence other pending matters, making it an intense period for crypto litigation.
 
Attorney James Murphy aka “MetaLawMan” has therefore compiled the most important deadlines over the next few months in the most relevant cases in a Twitter thread.
 
Probably the most important case, which could have a massive impact on all other crypto vs. SEC cases, is the Ripple lawsuit. Almost four months after the ruling on the Daubert motions, the XRP community is eagerly awaiting a summary judgement from Analisa Torres.

Italy’s prominent banking authority has raised concerns about the instability of these supposedly pegged stablecoins and emphasized the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework to mitigate potential risks. 
 
In their latest report titled “Markets, Infrastructures and Payment Systems,” the country’s central bank has urged regulators to impose robust and risk-based regulations on stablecoin issuers. The call for greater oversight aims to avert a worst-case scenario and ensure the stability and integrity of the digital currency landscape.

        <updated>2023-06-29T13:09:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded on Thursday, as markets reacted to the news that Microstrategy bought an additional $374 million worth of the cryptocurrency. Michael Saylor’s firm now has 152,333 bitcoin, worth roughly $4.52 billion. Ethereum moved closer to $1,900 on the news.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) edged higher in today’s session, after it was confirmed that Michael Saylor’s Microstrategy purchased 12,333 BTC.
 
Following the news, BTC/USD hit a high of $30,740.79, which comes after the price bottomed out at $29,921.82 the day prior.
 
Today’s rally has seen BTC briefly break out of a resistance level at the $30,700 mark, however bulls are struggling to sustain this.
 
 
At the the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $30,678.73, with the relative strength index (RSI) nearing a ceiling of its own at 68.00.
 
Price strength is now at 67.02, with earlier bulls seemingly opting to secure some gains as the aforementioned resistance looms.
 
In the event this zone is breached, there is a good chance the price will rise over the $31,000 mark.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) marginally rose on Thursday, after bouncing from a key support point.
 
ETH/USD jumped to an intraday peak at $1,874.01 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after settling at a low of $1,822.10.
 
Bulls rejected a breakout below a floor at $1,820, and have now instead begun to push price towards the $1,900 mark.
 
 
This started after the RSI rose above a resistance level at 53.00. It is currently tracking at 54.81.
 
As a result, bullish momentum has also heightened, with the 10-day (red) moving average extending its upward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
If this trend continues, ETH will likely hit $1,930 momentarily.
