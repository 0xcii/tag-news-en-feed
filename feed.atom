        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cboe Australia has listed new exchange-traded funds  
(ETFs) from iShares by BlackRock. This step marks BlackRock as the first asset  
manager to list its iShares ETFs on each of Cboe's listing exchanges worldwide.
Dave Howson, the Executive Vice President and Global  
President at Cboe Global Markets, mentioned: "This latest listing of  
iShares ETFs on Cboe Australia is a major milestone and a significant step  
forward to deliver on Cboe's global listings vision. Cboe is the only exchange network in the world  
facilitating access to global capital and secondary liquidity by offering an  
efficient path for asset managers to list across our five listings  
exchanges."
iShares ETFs Enter the Australian Market
The newly listed iShares ETFs on Cboe Australia  
include iShares MSCI World ex Australia Momentum ETF (Ticker: IMTM), iShares  
MSCI World ex Australia Quality ETF (Ticker: IQLT), and iShares MSCI World ex  
Australia Value ETF (Ticker: IVLU). Cboe is one of the largest ETF listing venues in the  
US, hosting over 680 ETF listings. According to the press release, Cboe  
Australia accounts for up to 40% of the Australian ETF daily trading volume.
Last month, The US Securities and Exchange  
Commission approved the applications of 11 firms for spot Bitcoin ETFs. These  
ETFs were authorized to be listed on US stock exchanges, including NYSE Arca,  
Nasdaq, and Cboe BZX, and are available for trading starting today.
The approved issuers are ARK 21Shares, Invesco  
Galaxy, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, Valkyrie, BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise,  
Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton.
Bitcoin ETFs Poised for Record Inflows
Analysts speculate significant inflows into Bitcoin  
ETFs, estimating between $50 billion and $100 billion in the first year.  
However, the SEC’s Chief Gary Gensler clarified the approval’s scope,  
emphasizing it does not reflect approval for crypto asset securities.

These products were approved and launched in January, which is significant in itself, but what has followed is a hugely impressive start, which has seen net flows for all BTC ETFs cumulatively surpass $3 billion, while two of the funds (IBIT and FBTC) are already–despite being only around a month old–in the top ten funds for year-to-date flows.
The ETFs are center stage and demand has been relentless, but there are further indicators suggesting that crypto is coming in from the cold, with a series of recent announcements regarding tie-ups between crypto products and mainstream, well-known companies.
