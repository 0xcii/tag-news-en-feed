Gary Gensler, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appointed by US President Joe Biden, has been a vocal critic of cryptocurrency. He strongly opposed the FIT21 bill after it passed in the House, reflecting his cautious stance on crypto regulation. Industry lobbyists argue that Gensler’s influence has swayed many Democratic lawmakers, who often rely on party-appointed regulators for expertise on complex financial issues.
