According to a report released by Ark Invest, the NFT market has gone through a shift in the bear market. For tracking how the sector has been changing, the report has used the data for the NFT mints taking place in each quarter of the year.
 
The share of the total mints contributed by each of the different project types is considered here. The “project types” are made up of art, avatar, collectibles, gaming, utility, and virtual worlds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin surged above $24,000 on Feb. 02, as markets continued to react to the latest U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision. On Wednesday, the central bank moved to increase rates by 25 basis points, while signaling that further hikes could be on the cards. Ethereum also rallied, with prices nearing $1,700. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rose to a six-month high on Thursday, with prices climbing above $24,000 for the first time since August.
 
The move came as the Federal Reserve opted to increase interest rates by 25 basis points in its latest policy meeting.
 
As a result, BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $24,167.21, less than 24-hours after it was trading at a low of $22,877.75.
 
 
Thursday’s surge saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency climb to its strongest point since August 16, when prices reached a peak of $24,448.
 
This took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved away from a recent floor at 68.00, and is now tracking at 74.10.
 
Should price strength continue on this course, a resistance level of 77.00 will likely be a target for current bulls.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also made significant gains in the last 24 hours, as traders pushed prices close to the $1,700 mark.
 
Following a low of $1,566.86 on Wednesday, ETH/USD raced to a peak of $1,689.07 earlier in today’s session.
 
This rally in price saw ethereum move to its highest mark since September 12, when ETH reached a top at $1,761.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s five-month high came as ETH broke out of its long-term price ceiling at $1,670.
 
Although one point of resistance has been broken, ethereum bulls are fast approaching another, with the relative strength index (RSI) nearing a ceiling at 68.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 65.19, with earlier bulls likely to consider taking profits before a full collision occurs.

Bitcoin’s prominent memetic narrative as “digital gold” begs a comparison to the real yellow metal. But since the advent of Bitcoin, comparative perspectives of the mining sectors underlying both assets are too often missing.
In May 2022, this author published data on the gold/bitcoin mining contrast as digital gold producers were significantly underperforming ore miners. Now, the time seems right to provide a follow-up overview of some recent market data for bitcoin and gold miners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After consolidating above $22.600, Bitcoin has now broken its $23k resistance level after the US Federal Reserve announced the start of the disinflationary process of the US economy, raising the interest rate by another 25 base points. This acknowledgement has also led to the broader financial market to rise in the face of such dovish remarks. 
 
According to Coingecko, Bitcoin rose 3.2% in the last 24 hours as the announcement of the rate hike hits the markets. However, the central bank is still not optimistic about their future moves this year with Federal Reserve chairman James Powell eyeing more rate hikes in the near future. 
 
At a press conference, Powell indicated that the Fed may be winding down its rate hikes because of the slowdown in inflation.

In the legal battle between blockchain-based content sharing and publishing platform LBRY and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Deaton and LBRY scored a major victory for the entire crypto industry. As Bitcoinist reported, the lawyer participated as an amicus of tech journalist Naomi Brockwell in the hearing on remedies in the case LBRY v. SEC.
 
LBRY’s legal team and Deaton succeeded in getting the SEC to confirm on the record that secondary market sales of cryptocurrencies, for example by exchanges, do not constitute securities transactions.
