        Bitcoin volatility returns with an exchange rate crash. 
    
Aug. 17, marked the return of the much-awaited and notorious bitcoin volatility. After several months of consolidating around the $30,000 level with historically low realized and implied volatility in the bitcoin market, the price finally awakened, bringing about the biggest liquidation event bitcoin has seen in years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data shows the Bitcoin open interest has continued to climb recently, a sign that another violent move may be brewing for the asset.
 
Bitcoin Open Interest Is Steadily Going Up Right Now
 
In a new post on X, Maartunn, the community manager at CryptoQuant Netherlands, has looked into how the derivative metrics for Bitcoin right now compare against those seen before the recent crash.
 
There are mainly two indicators of interest here: the open interest and the funding rate. The former measures the total number of BTC positions on the derivative platforms.
 
When this metric’s value goes up, investors are opening up new market positions. Generally, such a trend leads to higher volatility for the cryptocurrency, as the total leverage in the market also increases with the indicator’s rise.

Gemini Moves to Dismiss SEC Claims, Advocates for Oral Argument
 
Earlier this year, the SEC accused Gemini and its associate, Genesis Global Capital, of illicitly offering and vending unregistered securities via the Gemini Earn program. According to the SEC, both the program’s Master Digital Asset Loan Agreement and the program itself were unregistered securities unlawfully offered and sold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin was back in the green to start the week, despite the crypto market continuing to trend mostly lower. At the time of writing, the global market cap is down 0.59%, following a recent red wave. Ethereum classic also climbed higher on Monday, hitting a four-day high in the process.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) rose for a third consecutive session on Monday, as the token continued to move away from a recent nine-month low.
 
Following a bottom at $64.33 on Sunday, LTC/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $66.70 earlier in the day.
 
LTC has mostly been in the green since falling to its lowest point since November, during last week’s session.
 
 
As a result of recent bearish momentum, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) dropped below the 20.00 mark.
 
Currently, the index is at a reading of 21.13, which is marginally below an upcoming resistance level of 23.00.
 
If litecoin were to break out of this level, the next price target will likely be $70.00.
 
 
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
 
Additionally, ethereum classic also moved higher to start the week, following a recent drop below a floor at $15.00.
 
ETC/USD rose to a high of $15.90 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $15.38.
 
 
Today’s peak sees ethereum classic trade at its highest point since last Thursday, when price was over $16.00.
 
Price strength on ETC is now hovering around 28.00, with a ceiling of 29.00 the next obstacle to overcome.
 
Should it rise beyond this hurdle, there is a good chance that ETC will be above $16.00.

        <updated>2023-08-21T14:55:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genesis Digital Assets (GDA), one of the worlds largest Bitcoin miners in terms of hash rate, has announced the inauguration of its new mining facility situated in the northern reaches of Sweden, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. The data center's capacity is currently 8 megawatts (MW), with plans for further expansion "in the near future," and has been operational since June 2023.
The new facility is strategically located near the 417 MW Porjus Hydroelectric Power Station, known for its carbon-free electricity production. GDA aims to take advantage of this renewable energy source for its Bitcoin mining operations.
"With abundant energy sources, a pro-innovation environment, and a strong educational system that results in a great culture of innovation, we believe that Sweden is one of the best countries in the world where to mine bitcoin and expect to further invest in this beautiful region moving forward," commented Tim Carra, Head of Nordic Operations at GDA.
GDA has collaborated with a local company help to oversee the day-to-day operations of the new facility. The facility, which was once a conventional data center, marks GDA's third venture in Sweden within a three-year span, including a greenhouse data center pilot introduced in 2020.
"Our expansion of facilities in the Nordics is a testament to our unwavering commitment to utilizing green energy sources," said Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, Executive President and Co-Founder of GDA. "We aim to lead the bitcoin mining industry by setting an example for other players by minimizing our environmental impact."]]></summary>
