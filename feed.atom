At the time of writing, the soaring trajectory of Bitcoin’s price took a sudden nosedive over the past 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency’s value plummeting by 3.88.% to a disappointing $29,901 according to CoinMarketCap. 
 

 
 
Adding to its woes, Bitcoin also experienced a seven-day slump of 4.03%, causing investors to question whether the digital asset’s once-meteoric rise has come to a screeching halt.

Cross-border payments with and without XRP are known to be the core business of Ripple, with only one line of business really making money, the one with XRP, according to Hyatt. Because of this, the company is keen on good marketing that sells the rapid growth of its XRP-based On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) payment technology.
