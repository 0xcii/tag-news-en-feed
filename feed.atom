This speculative notion suggests that bitcoin often performs exceptionally well during the December festive season, although this isn’t a consistent trend. Nevertheless, this hypothesized event is gaining traction across social media platforms and discussion forums.
 
Will Bitcoin See a Festive Santa Rally?
