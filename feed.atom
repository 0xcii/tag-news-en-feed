Bitcoin To Hit $156,000 By May 2025

Instead, BTC is known to have made significant price increases a year after each halving. 
 
 
Bitcoin is said to have recorded an 8,296% price gain a year after the first halving in 2012, a 288% price gain a year after the second halving in 2016, and…]]></summary>

a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following
