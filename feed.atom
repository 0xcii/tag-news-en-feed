        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bottlepay, a popular consumer app for Bitcoin transactions, has announced its closure on Monday, July 24, 2023, leaving users with the task of withdrawing their funds. The company stated that all accounts will be closed, and users are urged to withdraw their funds either as Bitcoin or fiat currency (GBP/EUR) from the Bottlepay app before the closure date. 
Failure to withdraw funds by the closure date will result in Bitcoin being converted to fiat currency and returned to the nominated bank account, while any fiat left in the account will be returned to the nominated bank account as well.
In a statement, Bottlepay advised users to utilize the app's downloads feature to save transaction statements before the closure date. The company emphasized that Bitcoin transactions can have tax implications, making the downloaded information valuable for future reference. As the closure date approaches, Bottlepay may contact users who still have Bitcoin or fiat currency in their accounts, either through the app or via email. However, the company cautioned users to be aware of potential scams and never initiate an offboarding process outside of the app.
Regarding the next steps, users are advised to download their transaction history and close their Bottlepay accounts. Instructions on how to withdraw funds from Bitcoin and fiat accounts, as well as how to download transaction history and close accounts, can be found on the app.
In a closing note, Bottlepay expressed gratitude to its customers and apologized for the inconvenience caused by the closure. While the company refrained from making specific recommendations about what to do with Bitcoin funds, users were encouraged to exercise due diligence when selecting alternative custodial wallets or converting Bitcoin to fiat currency. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) register can be consulted for information on other FCA-registered cryptoasset businesses operating in the UK.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is still in a bearish trend even after US inflation data came out as expected. The uncertainty that looms over the market this time around is tied to the US debt ceiling which is reportedly reaching its limit. As it draws near, it is increasingly negative for risk assets, which might see BTC drop back to $25,000.
 
US Debt Ceiling Looms Over Bitcoin
 
The effect of the climbing US debt ceiling is showing prominently in not only the crypto market but in the stock market as well. In fact, it is Bitcoin’s high correlation with the stock market that has seen it go down as well in such market conditions.
 
 
According to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the US will hit its debt ceiling as early as June 1. This only leaves around two weeks before then, and investors are understandably wa…]]></summary>

The SEC sued Ripple in 2020, alleging that the company failed to register the XRP cryptocurrency as a security and raised over $1.3 billion through unregistered, ongoing digital asset sales. The company has denied the SEC’s allegations and has argued that XRP is a currency, not a security.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tron was a notable gainer on Thursday, as the token edged closer to a fresh one-year high in today’s session. This came despite the global cryptocurrency market cap mostly trading lower, falling by 1% as of writing. Polygon also rebounded today.
 
Tron (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) was marginally higher on Thursday, as the token moved back towards a one-year high.
 
Following a low of $0.07651 on Wednesday, TRX/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.07819 earlier today.
 
The move came as prices rebounded following a drop which took place yesterday, which came as a result of profit taking.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the bounce occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) found a support point.
 
This aforementioned floor was at the 70.00 level, which is already deep in overbought territory
 
Price strength is now tracking at 70.42, with bears likely to attempt to send the token lower in the coming days.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was another notable mover on Thursday, as the token also rebounded today.
 
MATIC/USD hit a peak of $0.8895 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $0.8591.
 
As a result of today’s surge, MATIC rose by as much as 3%, moving away from a recent floor at $0.8390 in the process
 
 
Earlier gains have somewhat eased however, which comes as the RSI collided with a ceiling at 45.00
 
The index has since slipped, and as of writing, is tracking at 44.06, with TRX at $0.07758.
