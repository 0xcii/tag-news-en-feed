From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin miner profit/loss sustainability had been at positive levels earlier when the rally towards the new all-time high had occurred.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently suggested that the worst might be over for Bitcoin. If so, the flagship crypto may be primed for a move to the upside, rising to as high as $100,000, which some other crypto analysts have predicted would be the case. 
 
Bitcoin Is Out Of The “Danger Zone”
 
Rekt Capital mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Bitcoin Post-Halving “Danger Zone” is officially over. He added that Bitcoin is “celebrating with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support.” The crypto analyst had previously explained that the danger zone was the downside wick that Bitcoin experienced 21 days after the halving in 2016.

The cryptomining facility, operated by MineOne Partners Limited and related MineOne entities registered in Delaware, was flagged as a potential security risk due to its proximity to sensitive military installations and a nearby Microsoft data center that supports the Pentagon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alexey Pertsev, a developer for the Ethereum-based crypto mixer Tornado Cash, has been sentenced to 64 months in prison after a Dutch court found him guilty of money laundering charges on Tuesday.
The judge stated that the platform was "intended for criminals" and that Pertsev should have been suspicious of the criminal origins of transactions.
The closely-watched case marks a major blow to financial privacy advocates. Many critics argue that Pertsev is being unfairly targeted as the developer of an open-source platform. 
Further, they say he did not have control over how users chose to employ Tornado Cash to obscure transaction histories on the public blockchain.
Nonetheless, prosecutors successfully argued that Pertsev did too little to prevent the mixer from being utilized for money laundering. 
They rejected claims that his obligations were lessened due to the decentralized nature of the platform's operations.
Experts predict it will have a chilling effect on development of open-source tools that enable anonymity on Bitcoin and other blockchains. They argue it sets a precedent for holding developers liable for the actions of anonymous users.
Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in 2022 over allegations it obscured funds stolen by North Korean state hackers. Pertsev was arrested days later, dealing a major blow to the embryonic crypto privacy sector.]]></summary>
