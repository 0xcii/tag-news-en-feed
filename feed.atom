        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VanEck CEO Jan van Eck has disclosed on CNBC’s “ETF Edge” that the much-awaited spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are set to commence trading on Thursday, January 11. This follows yesterday evening’s last minute request from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for additional comments on the S-1 filings from all applicants.
 
Despite initial concerns about potential delays, as reported by Bitcoinist, reassurances were offered by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart and Davis Polk’s Scott Johnsson, which have alleviated such fears. Seyffart predicted that the amendments will drop today. “I don’t think this is necessarily a delay signal. Really this just shows how quickly the SEC is turning these things around,” he remarked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of Jan. 9, 2024, fewer than 15,000 blocks remain before the fourth Bitcoin halving event. This milestone will halve the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins per block. Expected to occur in April 2024, this event will render bitcoin increasingly scarce. However, it may exert considerable pressure on miners, seeing their earnings cut by 50% following the halving.

The Bitcoin halving event is approaching and is estimated to be just over 100 days away, assuming block times maintain their average of ten minutes. Current statistics, as of this writing, indicate that 14,981 blocks remain until the halving.
 
This upcoming event marks the fourth halving; the first occurred on Nov. 28, 2012, followed by the second on July 9, 2016, and the …]]></summary>
