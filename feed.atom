The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has revealed intentions to compel cryptocurrency enterprises, including exchanges, to seek financial services licenses under the Corporations Act.
 
This decision comes amid growing worries about frauds and the need for an extensive monitoring of the fast changing digital asset sector.
 
 
 Australia will require crypto firms to obtain financial licenses as ASIC plans to update guidance on crypto assets, now seen as financial products, by November.https://t.co/z78kPXIw54

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is firm, adding nearly 30% after sinking to as low as $49,000 in early August. As bulls strengthen and fundamental factors swing in favor of the world’s most valuable coin, prices remain below $65,000. Looking at the daily chart, this reaction level coincides with August highs. 
 
Technically, if buyers find the required momentum, breaking above this level, it could soar to as high as $70,000, a psychological level, and even break $72,000. If this happens, it will mark the first time since June that bulls have overcome the resistance at their reaction level.

Coinbase contended that the SEC's current regulatory
