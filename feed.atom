        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below the $27,000 level on Thursday, as markets reacted to the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision. As expected, the Fed opted to keep rates unchanged at 5.5%, whilst hinting at one additional raise in the current cycle. The dollar strengthened across the board following the decision. Ethereum is on the cusp of a drop under $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin fell for a second consecutive day, in the aftermath of the U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision.
 
Following a high of $27,289.77 on Wednesday, BTC/USD dropped to a low of $26,703.77 earlier in today’s session.
 
The Fed’s decision to pause has led to dollar strength, with USD hitting its strongest level since April versus the British pound.
 
 
As a result of the BTC drop, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell below a support point at the 55.00 level.
 
Price strength now stands at a reading of 52.45, and appears to be heading for a lower floor near the 45.00 region.
 
Should the index fall to this floor, there is a good chance that bitcoin could be hovering near $26,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) neared a drop below a key price level in today’s session, hitting a one-week low in the process.
 
ETH/USD slipped to an intraday low of $1,606.18 earlier in the day, following Wednesday’s peak at $1,639.35.
 
Thursday’s decline pushed ethereum to its weakest point since September 13, which is the last time price was below $1,600.
 
 
Since failing to break out of a ceiling at 49.00, the RSI has moved closer into oversold territory, and now tracks at 41.52.
 
Bears seem to be looking to land at a point of support at 35.00, which could lead ETH to hitting the $1,575 floor.
 
Bulls are possibly still waiting in the wings, as the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages have still not crossed.

Bitcoin Shorters Take Center Stage
 
As shown in a report that was shared by on-chain data tracker Santiment, crypto investors are becoming increasingly short on Bitcoin. The chart that was posted on X (formerly Twitter) shows short positions completely overwhelming the long positions for now.
 
 
Now, in times where long positions are dominating, it means that long traders are paying shorts, and in this case, prices are more likely to drop. Likewise, when short positions dominate the market…]]></summary>
