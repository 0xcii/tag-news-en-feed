        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The extradition of Kwon Do-hyung, also known as Do Kwon,  
from Montenegro to South Korea has been postponed once again. This decision was  
made by the Supreme Court of Montenegro yesterday (Thursday). The court will  
review the legality of the extradition request from South Korea before making a  
final decision, expected early next week.
Legal Battle Continues
Last Thursday, an  
appeals court upheld a previous ruling to extradite Kwon to South Korea, as  
reported by Finance Magnates.  
This decision rejected a request to extradite him to the United States instead.  
The appeals court's ruling confirmed an earlier decision by a lower court.
Kwon has been involved in a lengthy legal battle over his  
extradition. The South Korean charges against him are not publicly known, but US

Solana Facing New Transaction Processing Challenges
 
Taking to X, one user said the network has alarmingly high transaction failure rates. This performance problem, the analyst added, tends to significantly impact user experience, watering down the network’s benefits, mostly centered on low gas fees and high scalability. 
 
 
Sharing transaction data from Jupiter, a DEX aggregator on Solana, paints a worrying reality. For every 24 hours, the analyst noted, only 35% of all transactions posted go through. This means that a majority, roughly 65%, are not processed.

Crypto ETF Expansion Faces Headwinds In Japan
 
Hideki Ito, commissioner of Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), emphasized the need for “cautious consideration” when greenlighting crypto-linked ETFs in the country. Ito expressed concerns that crypto assets “do not necessarily contribute to the wealth creation of the Japanese people in a stable and long-term manner.”
 
 
Hideki Ito’s comments come from global regulators who have softened their stance on ETFs that invest directly in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).
