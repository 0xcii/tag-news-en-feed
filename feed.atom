        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Dec. 24, 2023, Bitcoin shattered yet another daily transaction milestone, with miners confirming 723,459 transfers in a single day. The transaction rate on Christmas Eve exceeded the former peak of 710,579 verifications on Nov. 19, 2023.
 
Bitcoin’s Festive Feat — Record Transactions and Hashrate Soar on Christmas Eve
 
Throughout the festive weekend, the Bitcoin network set two fresh records. On Christmas Eve, the network achieved a historic high with 723,459 bitcoin transactions confirmed by miners in a single day. It surpassed the previous high of 710,579 set 36 days earlier by an impressive margin of 12,880 transactions. The marked surge in daily transactions on Dec. 24 primarily stemmed from Ordinal inscriptions, contributing a considerable volume of the day’s transfers.
 

 
Dune Analytics data indicates that about 439,505 Ordinal inscriptions were verified on Sunday. Consequently, inscriptions outpaced traditional financial transfers, making up 60.75% of all transactions on Christmas Eve 2023. The previous record from Nov. 19 now ranks as the second highest, with Dec. 3, 2023, trailing as the third with 707,876 transfers.
 
 
Beyond setting a daily transaction record on Christmas Eve, bitcoin (BTC) miners also achieved a new pinnacle in the network’s total hashrate. The cumulative hashrate soared to 546 exahash per second (EH/s) on Dec. 24, climbing from 538 EH/s the previous day as network difficulty breached 72 trillion. This rate translates to 546 quintillion hashes per second (H/s) or 0.546 zettahash per second (ZH/s). From Jan. 1, 2023, to date, the hashrate has escalated by 311 EH/s.

At the same time, during his reign, engineers worked arduously on a chess engine. Convinced they were, that one day, the computer would defeat even the greatest player of all time.

As pointed out by analyst Ali in a new post on X, a large amount of Shiba Inu has left exchanges since November. The relevant metric here is the “Balance on Exchanges,” which keeps track of the total amount of SHIB that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that the investors are depositing a net number of coins to these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons why investors would make such transfers is for selling purposes, this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the asset’s price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Japanese government has approved a tax reform that removes some crypto taxes for corporations and conglomerates. The reform, discussed since early December, removes the unrealized gains taxes on crypto holdings for companies, paving the way for them to hold crypto assets more consistently.
Japanese Government Approves Tax Reform to Eliminate Unrealized Gains Tax
The Japanese cabinet convened to approve the FY2018 tax reform, which includes a series of modifications to rules affecting companies in the cryptocurrency area. The reform included a change that removed the “unrealized gains” crypto tax that mandated companies to pay tribute based on the price change of crypto assets each fiscal year.
A change that eliminated this tax for companies’ self-issued cryptocurrencies had already been approved earlier this year, but with this modification, crypto companies can now hold crypto issued by third parties without paying the unrealized gains taxes.
However, cryptocurrency sales and purchases will continue to be taxed. This opposes the petition of the Japan Crypto Asset Business Association, which asked for eliminating the tax on crypto exchanges. According to local media, the measure will contribute to a general reduction in tax-derived income for June 2024, expected to be the largest since 1989.
The reform, which had been in discussion since early December, is directed to make it easier for corporations to add crypto to their treasury without paying for simply holding it. Japan is one of the few countries that applies this unrealized crypto gains tax, prompting companies to hold these assets in other countries.
Nonetheless, even after this approval, the tax reform will have to be presented to the Diet next year and will have to be passed by both houses.
