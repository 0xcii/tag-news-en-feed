        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/breaking-sec-greenlights-ether-etfs-issuers-await-final-approval/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US securities regulator has approved proposals from Nasdaq, Cboe, and NYSE to list ether  
exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking a major regulatory win in the cryptocurrency  
space. Recently, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent a positive signal regarding Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), sparking a surge  
in Ether prices.
Optimism about the SEC's approval of Ether ETF pushed the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by 25% in the  
past week. Earlier, a flurry of filings and rule change requests by the  
regulator pointed towards a potential approval.
Ether Price Surges
Recently, the SEC requested updates to filings from  
the New York Stock Exchange and Cboe Global Markets, a move the crypto industry interpreted as  
a sign of rising prospects of a possible approval, Bloomberg reported. Besides  
that, Fidelity Investments updated its registration statement for a proposed ether ETF. 
Notably, the asset management firm plans to avoid  
staking and derivatives to address regulatory  
concerns. Similar activities by the SEC preceded the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in  
January, which became a record-breaking product launch. 
Following the regulatory win, the expectation is that  
Ether ETFs could follow a similar path, bringing a massive influx of capital  
and potentially propelling Ether prices even higher. Elsewhere, Grayscale  
Ethereum Trust aims to convert into an ETF.
Expect ongoing updates as this article evolves.

Ethereum To Rise To $100,000
 
In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Markus raised the possibility of Ethereum rising to $100,000, remarking that he needs the crypto token to reach this price level so he can finally purchase a house in Los Angeles. Markus’ prediction for ETH is undoubtedly one of the most ultra-bullish predictions for the crypto token and ETH reaching this price mark will be huge.
 
 
For one, Ethereum rising to $100,000 will give it a market cap of $12 trillion based on its current circulating supply. That will place the crypto tok…]]></summary>
