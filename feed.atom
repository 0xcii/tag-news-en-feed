        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the countdown to the fourth Bitcoin halving approaches, scheduled around April 19th, 2024, miners are bracing for significant changes in their operations. The halving, which occurs approximately every four years, marks a pivotal event in Bitcoin’s economic landscape, impacting both miners’ revenues and the network’s security.
 
Currently, miners receive 6.25 bitcoins as a reward for each validated block. However, with the upcoming halving, this reward will be slashed by half, dropping to 3.125 bitcoins per block. This abrupt reduction in revenue poses challenges for miners, particularly those operating on narrow profit margins.
 
 
According to a report by cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, The halving’s immediate effect is a 50% decline in miners’ income, which could render some operati…]]></summary>

How Bankman-Fried Intended To Avoid Prison
 
As part of his plans to avoid a jail term, Sam Bankman-Fried included going on Tucker Carlson and coming out as a Republican. This formed part of what Sam Bankman-Fried had termed “probably bad ideas” in the Google doc, which contained a long list of things he planned to do to save face.

Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Dived Down Recently
 
As the Bitcoin network works on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, validators called miners have to compete with each other using computing power to get a chance to add the next block to the chain.
 
The total measure of this computing power that’s currently connected to the BTC blockchain is known as the “mining hashrate.” This metric can directly correlate to the security of the network, since if a malicious entity has to succeed in an attack, it has to take over at least 51% of the total computing power.
 
 
Naturally, when the hashrate goes up, so does the resistance of the blockchain, as there…]]></summary>
