Despite the contraction, traders are confident of what lies ahead, expecting the coin to turn the corner and print higher. In a post on X, one analyst predicts Bitcoin will reach $90,000 in the next two months, especially if it continues tracking the global M2 money supply trend. 
 
 
In the analyst’s findings, the global M2 money supply directly correlates to Bitcoin prices. That means whenever there is an uptick in global money supply, BTC’s prices also edge higher.
