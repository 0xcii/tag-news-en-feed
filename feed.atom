Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin remained above the $30,000 level on Friday, as traders attempted to keep sentiment bullish heading into the weekend.
 
Following a low of $29,679.16 earlier in the day, BTC/USD moved to a peak of $30,334.40 as the day progressed.
 
Price has since gone on to fall from its previous high, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) encountered a point of resistance.

To accomplish this, the financial powerhouse will utilize its Progmat platform for minting these coins.
 
Since the beginning of June, Japan has implemented a new law, allowing licensed banks, trust companies, and registered money transfer agents in the country to legally issue these cryptocurrencies. By establishing itself as a global hub for stablecoin issuance, Japan has positioned itself to support the expansion of decentralized internet and web3 companies.

Death is not something that many people like talking about all too much, but it is crucial to sit and have a good think about what will happen to all of your earthly belongings when the inevitable eventually happens. 
Despite its importance, a 2021 study found that less than half of all adults in the U.S. have a will set up at all. While many are too scared of thinking about it, a large number of people simply feel that they lack the know-how for setting one up or want to wait until they have children before they feel the need to sort out their afterlives.
Over the last year or so, I decided to have this “will” discussion with myself, and after much thinking and many hours of research, the answer for the bes…]]></summary>

The origin of the rumor is popular XRP army member @NFAdotcrypto. The user shared a video clip from Fed chairman Jerome Powell’s semi-annual testimony before the US Congress yesterday. Congressman Wiley Nickel asks the Fed chairman how he liked the recent concert by the Grateful Dead, an American rock band founded in 1965.
 
Powell replied that he had been a “Grateful Dead fan” for 50 years, whereupon Congressman Wiley Nickel replied, “I found a universal truth, I like people who like the Grateful Dead.” And here comes the connection …]]></summary>
