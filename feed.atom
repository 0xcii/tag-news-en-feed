Bailey, who is serving as one of Trump’s closed Bitcoin advisors, boldly asserted that multiple central banks globally are actively acquiring Bitcoin.
 
Central Banks Are Buying Bitcoin
 
“David Bailey just claimed — without any evidence in Dylan LeClair ‘s space with Matthew Pines that central banks are buying Bitcoin,” stated Joe Carlasare, a partner at Amundsen Davis LLC. In a follow-up post on X, Bailey specifically pointed to lesser-known global players like Bhutan and Venezuela, as well as Iran, as early adopters in the central banking space.

Ripple’s lawyers argued that the penalty proposed against the blockchain company by the regulator was “unreasonable” when compared to the civil penalty sought against Terraform Labs.
