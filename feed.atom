The investigation, led by Representatives Jim Jordan, Patrick McHenry, and James Comer, centers on allegations of political favoritism in the SEC’s hiring practices.
 
SEC Hiring Scandal
 
In the letter addressed to Gensler, the lawmakers highlighted an email correspondence made public in an SEC rulemaking comment, which suggested that the hiring of Dr. Haoxiang Zhu, the SEC Director of Trading and Markets, may have been influenced by his political affiliation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The prices of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE have been on the come-up as the Bitcoin price has recovered. However, at this time, all of their profitability levels remain different, meaning investors in these meme coins are seeing varying levels of profit and losses. In this report, we compare the profitability levels of these three meme coins, in a bid to figure out which has been the best investment based on return on investment.
 
Dogecoin Profitability Remains Highest
 
As the largest meme coin in the market, the Dogecoin price has often set the tone for how investors are looking at meme coins. This often means a rally for Dogecoin can often spread to the other meme coins and trigger a market-wide meme coin rally. As a result, it remains the top choice for meme coin investors.

With tokens like GoodEgg (GEGG), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE) reigniting investor confidence, the meme coin sector is positioning itself for a monumental comeback. The question on everyone’s mind is, can GoodEgg, SHIB, and DOGE each reach the coveted $0.5 mark, and how are they reshaping the meme coin landscape?
 
Dogecoin (DOGE): The Comeback King 
When it comes to meme coins, Dogecoin (DOGE) is undoubtedly the king. Originally launched in 2013 as a joke, Dogecoin quickly built a devoted community and became synonymous with internet culture. The coin’s popularity soared in 2021, largely thanks to tweets from tech billionaire Elon Musk, which sent DOGE to all-time highs. However…]]></summary>

Despite this recent uptick, large investors, also known as whales, are shifting their focus towards a new contender in the meme coin space: GoodEgg (GEGG), a Play-to-Date token that has been gaining traction.
 
Pepecoin (PEPE) has long been a favorite in the meme coin sector. Since its inception, it has captured the attention of retail and institutional investors alike. However, despite this week’s price increase, market indicators suggest that Pepecoin (PEPE) may be in a phase of overvaluation. The MVRV ratio, currently sitting at 1.34, hints at the possibility that many investors are sitting on unrealized gains, which could lead to profit-taking and, potentially, downward price press…]]></summary>

Pepe ($PEPE): A Struggle for Stability

While these advancements were driven by better chip technology, we're now reaching the limits of silicon-based semiconductors. As further efficiency gains plateau, the focus must shift to optimizing other aspects of mining operations—particularly the power setup.
Three-phase power has emerged as a superior alternative to single-phase power in bitcoin mining. With more ASICs being designed for three-phase voltage input, future mining infrastructure should consider adopting a uniform 480v three-phase system, especially given its abundance and scalability across North America.
