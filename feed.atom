This move is part of Custodia’s continued efforts to secure direct access to the Kansas City Fed’s payment systems, which it deems crucial for the growth of its operations. 
 
 
Custodia’s Legal Struggle With The Federal Reserve
 
The appeal by Custodia marks the latest development in a prolonged legal battle that began when the Wyoming-based crypto bank first applied for a master account with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in 2022. This account would enable Custodia to bypass intermediary banks, positioning it directly within the federal financial network.

Bloomberg has reported that the profitability of Bitcoin mining is nearing a record low, not seen since the days following the collapse of FTX, posing significant challenges for those securing the network.
 
The data indicates that the “hashprice,” a metric that gauges the revenue a miner earns daily for each petahash of computing power, has dipped alarmingly close to its all-time low.
 
This decrease is notable, considering it came after the recent Bitcoin halving event on April 20, which traditionally boosted the cryptocurrency’s value but, this time, failed to counteract the bearish pressures from global economic uncertainties.
