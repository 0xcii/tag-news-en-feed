Last week, a federal court mandated the SEC to revisit its prior rejection of Grayscale’s bid to convert its BTC Trust (GBTC) into an spot ETF. The court’s decision was rooted in the SEC’s “arbitrary and capricious” stance, where it failed to elucidate its differential treatment of futures-based ETFs and spot-based Bitcoin ETFs.
