        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-moves-to-5-month-high-as-eth-nears-1700/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-21T13:09:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin surged to a five-month high to start the weekend, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. Prices of the world’s largest digital currency rose above $23,000, rebounding from a recent drop towards $20,000. Ethereum also rallied, as it hit its strongest point since September.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) raced past the $23,000 level to start the weekend, with prices climbing to a multi-month high.
 
Following a low of $20,961.21 on Friday, BTC/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $23,249.89 earlier today.
 
Today’s rally saw bitcoin jump to its highest level since August 24, when price at the time was trading at a top of $23,600.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved back towards a ceiling of 90.00.
 
Currently, the index is at the 86.30 level, with earlier gains somewhat fading, as traders move to secure profits.
 
As of writing, BTC is trading at $22,902.03, which is still roughly 9.27% higher than yesterday’s low.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Like bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also surged on Saturday, as it climbed to its highest mark in the last four months.
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,674.18 earlier in the day, which comes following a bottom of $1,550.03 on Friday.
 
As a result of the move, ethereum recaptured a high not seen since September 13, which is the last time it traded over $1,700.
 
 
Although prices are currently below this threshold, the resurgence of bullish momentum on Saturday could lead to further surges this weekend.
 
The surge has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average back into an uptrend, extending its distance from its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Overall, ethereum is up 6.28% as of writing.

According to Yahoo! Finance, Hoskinson’s reasoning as to why he has shown strong interest in buying up DCG’s media unit is that he believes journalism integrity should be restored. The Cardano co-founder’s interest was made known after CoinDesk announced its exploration of a possible sale.
 
Hoskinson disclosed in a video livestream in the U.S., last week:
 

“My interest on the media side is more broad… I would like to figure out how to get to journalistic integrity again.”

Crypto Valley in Switzerland Maintains Number of Residents Despite Crypto Winter
 
The market downturn and the collapse of platforms like cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the Terra-luna ecosystem sent shockwaves through the industry. The negative events of 2022 led to losses for investors, customers, and companies while major players like Coinbase and Genesis announced layoffs.

Speaking with Bloomberg Television in Davos, Switzerland – where the World Economic Forum is currently being held – UAE’s minister of state for foreign trade, Thani Al-Zeyoudi, made some positive statements on the potential role of cryptocurrency in the economy of the gulf nation.
 
“Crypto will play a major role for UAE trade going forward,” said Al-Zeyoudi. For years now, the UAE government has been working on transforming the nation into a global crypto hub, mainly by implementing crypto-friendly policies with the goal of attracting the big guns in the $1 trillion industry.

After a dismal 2022, the price of Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, has been inching upward over the past few weeks.
 
According to data from Coingecko, Bitcoin is trading at $22,709 at the time of writing, an increase of 15% over the past week.
 
However, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon remains unconvinced of the crypto’s performance. In fact, he has always been.
 
As far back September 2017, the chief executive had maintained an antagonistic stance against Bitcoin.

He minced no words during the time about the crypto by saying Bitcoin “is a fraud” and will “blow up.”

Chainalysis Registers Significant Decline in Revenue From Ransomware Attacks
 
Over the course of 2022, ransomware actors have managed to extort at least $456.8 million from victims, Chainalysis revealed in a report published Thursday. The estimated amount is down from $765.6 million the year before, the analytics company pointed out, noting that the true total is likely much higher, as many crypto addresses controlled by attackers have yet to be identified.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An Indian government official says that there is currently nothing that outlaws crypto in India “as long as you follow the legal process.” Meanwhile, the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has stressed that “cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value.”
 
Indian Government Official on Crypto
 
Indian government official Rajeev Chandrasekhar talked about cryptocurrency Thursday at an event in Bengaluru. Chandrasekhar currently serves as both India’s Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology and Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. He is also a member of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament.
 
He explained that India has no issue with cryptocurrencies if all laws are followed, Reuters reported, quoting him as saying:
 

There is nothing today that outlaws crypto as long as you follow the legal process.
 
The Indian government has not yet established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. In December last year, the government told parliament that crypto legislation “can be effective only with significant international collaboration.” Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said the government plans to discuss crypto regulations with the G20 countries.
 
However, crypto income is already taxed at 30% in India, and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) is levied on crypto transactions. Earlier this month, the government revealed that it is launching a crypto awareness campaign.
 
Meanwhile, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has recommended a complete ban on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week that “Cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value,” warning that “it will undermine the authority of the RBI and lead to the dollarization of the economy.” He even expects crypto to cause the next financial crisis if it is not banned.
