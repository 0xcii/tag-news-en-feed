        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin raced to a ten-day high to start the week, as markets returned from the Christmas holiday weekend. The token extended recent gains to start the week, and neared a key resistance point in the process. Xrp was also higher, as it also collided with a price ceiling.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was one of the notable gainers on Monday, as the token raced to a ten-day high.
 
LTC/USD rose to a high of $70.83 to start the week, which comes less than a day after hitting a low of $65.54.
 
Today’s surge has taken litecoin to its highest point since December 16, and closer to a key resistance level of $72.00.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, Monday’s move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose above its own ceiling at 45.00.
 
The index is currently tracking at 51.79, with the next visible point of support at the 54.00 level.
 
Should the RSI reach this point, it is highly likely that prices will also collide with a ceiling of $72.00.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, also moved higher to start the week, as the token collided with a key resistance point.
 
Following a low of $0.3447, XRP/USD hit a high of $0.356 earlier in today’s session, which is also a recent price ceiling.
 
Monday’s gain is the highest point that XRP has hit since December 18, and comes as traders returned from the Christmas holiday weekend.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this move accompanied a recent move beyond a ceiling on the RSI of 42.00.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 43.45, which is its strongest point since December 15.
 
Ultimately, should this trend continue, XRP could continue to move towards the $0.4000 mark.

Time To Sell Bitcoin
 
Taking to Twitter, Peter Schiff posted what he called his “Christmas gift” to bitcoin investors. The post followed the usual trend of bashing BTC, with a chart that he used to support his claim. The chart which shows the trend of the digital asset over the last six months pointed out that a support level had been turned into resistance.
 
 
Schiff said the chart shows that “bitcoin is much closer to its ceiling than it is to its floor.” As such, he believes that there is…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like most crypto projects this year, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) felt the pain of 2022’s crypto winter as sales are down a great deal and blue-chip NFTs have been slashed in value. For instance, last month, there was roughly $534 million in NFT sales compared to the $2.77 billion in NFT sales sold in Dec. 2021.
 
The NFT Industry Takes a Hit in 2022 — Sales and Google Searches Down Significantly
 
2022 hasn’t been kind to non-fungible token (NFT) holders, and statistics show that interest in the subject has dropped a great deal this year. Google Trends (GT) data shows that the search term “NFT” had a score of around 52 during the week of Dec. 26, 2021 – Jan. 1, 2022. The term also skyrocketed to the highest score of 100 on Jan. 16 – Jan. 22, 2022.
