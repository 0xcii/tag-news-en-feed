Cochran’s claims are based on a detailed analysis of Huobi’s balance sheets and the recent activities of Justin Sun, the founder of Tron.

The bad perception of the sector is one of the main causes of the diminishing interest in cryptocurrencies. A lack of trust and faith in digital assets has been exacerbated by instances of fraud and insolvency among significant market participants.
