North Korean Hackers Potentially Net $95M in a Week
 
On Tuesday, Coinex was hacked, losing about $54 million, which included 231 BTC, 6,559 ETH, 137.128 million TRX, and several million in assorted ERC20 tokens and stablecoins. Coinex informed the community about the hack after blockchain monitoring firms detected that the wallets were being drained. New findings suggest the hackers are likely from the North Korean hacking syndicate Lazarus Group.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ton-closes-in-on-2-after-news-of-telegram-partnership/"/>
        <updated>2023-09-13T15:37:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin moved closer to the $2.00 level on Wednesday, as markets reacted to the protocol’s partnership with Telegram. The agreement will see the token made available to over 800 million Telegram Wallet users. Stellar, on the other hand, was significantly lower, falling by nearly 8% today.
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was one of today’s biggest movers, as markets were buoyed by the news that it was partnering with Telegram.
 
Following a low of $1.73 on Tuesday, TON/USD rose to an intraday peak of $1.95 earlier in the day.
 
This surge resulted in toncoin rising by as much as 13%, nearing a recent high of $2.05 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move led to the relative strength index (RSI) colliding with a ceiling at the 66.00 level.
 
Earlier gains have since faded as a result of a failed breakout beyond this point, leading to TON now trading at $1.93.
 
In order to move above $2.00, the aforementioned ceiling on the RSI must first be broken.
 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
On the other side of the spectrum was stellar (XLM), which dropped by over 8% in today’s session.
 
XLM/USD bottomed out at $0.1195 on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after residing at a high of $0.1318.
 
This drop in price sees the token fall for a third consecutive day, falling below a floor at $0.1200 in the process.
 
 
It appears that today’s sell-off coincided with the RSI failing to remain above a point of support at 49.00.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 44.53, with the next visible zone of stability around the 37.00 region.
 
In the event that this level is reached, XLM will likely be trading under $0.1100.

Still, the remarks are notable given Dorsey's public role in Bitcoin's journey, leading to his current role as the CEO of Block, a company dedicated to advancing the adoption and technology of Bitcoin. Formerly called Square, the company is a longstanding payments innovator, one whose support buoys Bitcoin in the mainstream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved above the $26,000 level on Wednesday, ahead of the upcoming inflation report in the United States. Consumer prices for August are expected to come in at 3.6%, up from 0.4% the month prior. Core inflation on the other hand is forecasted to fall to 4.3%, from 4.7% in July. Ethereum was back above $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was once again trading above the $26,000 level in today’s session, as markets prepared for the upcoming U.S. inflation report.
 
Following a low of $25,781.12 on Tuesday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak of $26,451.94 earlier in the day.
 
The move comes as the world’s largest cryptocurrency continued to move away from a recent three-month low.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, Wednesday’s surge in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) jumped past a ceiling of 44.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 47.23, with the next visible point of resistance at the 50.00 mark.
 
In the case that this level is reached, there is a good chance that BTC will be trading closer to $27,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) moved away from Tuesday’s six-month low, climbing back above $1,600 in the process.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,616.54 in today’s session, following a bottom at $1,582.22 less than 24 hours before.
 
As a result of the rebound in price, the RSI has now moved out of oversold territory, and is hovering below a key ceiling.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Currently, the aforementioned resistance sits at 40.00, with price strength currently residing at 39.40.
 
Should this zone be broken, then there will likely be a push above the $1,620 support point.
