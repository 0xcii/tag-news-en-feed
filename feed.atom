Despite this correction, experts are optimistic about BTC’s future, suggesting that the current bull run is far from over. 
 
Bitcoin Price Surge Shows No Signs Of Stopping
 
According to Matrixport researcher Markus Thielen, 2023 is turning out exactly as they had envisioned it, and more Bitcoin gains are to come. 
 
This sentiment is based on a series of predictions made by the research firm, which have proved accurate so far. In December 2022, Matrixport predicted that BTC could reach $29,000 by 2023, based on its inflation model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The parallel market exchange rate of the Cuban peso versus the greenback recently dropped to CUP200 per dollar, a level last seen in Oct. 2022, a report has said. Pavel Vidal, a former economist at the Cuban central bank, said the peso’s depreciation has caused the “impoverishment of the economy and families in dollar terms.”
 
Peso Down by More Than 20% in 2023
 
According to data provided by El Toque, the Cuban peso’s exchange rate on the parallel market recently matched an all-time low of 200 per dollar last seen in Oct. 2022. The peso’s latest plunge means the currency, which is officially pegged at CUP25:USD1, has now depreciated by over 20% in 2023 alone and by more than 50% in under 12 months.
 
As per a report, the peso’s latest plunge has further eroded the purchasing power of Cuban salaries which rarely exceed an equivalent of $25 or 5,000 pesos per month. The currency’s accelerated depreciation is coming at a time when the country’s leader, Miguel Diaz-Canel, has joined other world leaders in advocating for an alternative to the U.S. dollar.
 

 
Commenting on the likely impact of the Central American state’s ongoing currency woes on the population, Pavel Vidal, a former economist at the Cuban central bank, said the peso’s depreciation has left many residents worse off.
 
“The exchange rate shows the impoverishment of the economy and families in dollar terms,” Vidal, a tutor at Colombia’s Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali, said.
 
Although Cuba is reported to have carried out some market reforms, Vidal insisted that such reforms have failed to boost domestic production. The tutor also argued that the market reforms had failed to contain inflation.
 
However, Cuban officials including President Diaz-Canel have consistently blamed the country’s economic woes on sanctions imposed by the U.S. in the 1960s.

Now, the New York Federal Prosecutors Office and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have reportedly requested Swiss prosecutors to freeze cryptocurrency assets and fiat currency associated with Terraform Labs.
 
Allegedly, the assets in question were stored at Sygnum Bank, a bank that positions itself as the world’s inaugural digital assets bank and operates branches in Switzerland, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi.
 
The US SEC claims that Do Kwon had utilized a Swiss banking institution to convert 10,000 BTC into cash following the collapse of LUNA/UST in 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong's leading financial institution, HSBC, has made a significant move by allowing its customers to trade Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This development marks a notable shift in the stance of traditional banks towards bitcoin, as HSBC has previously been cautious in embracing it.
Reporting by CoinDesk highlighted that HSBC's decision to enable bitcoin ETF trading for its customers comes after several prior developments that saw other banks also allow such activity. Notably, Samsung Asset Management launched the Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prior to that, the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF launched on the same platform, receiving approximately $53 million in initial investments. 
The decision by HSBC to allow its customers to trade bitcoin ETFs comes amidst a surge of institutional interest in bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., potentially igniting a race between countries to attract capital with these products. 
The developments are also indicative of the evolving attitudes towards bitcoin among financial institutions. As traditional banks begin to embrace bitcoin, it signals a potential shift towards wider adoption and integration of bitcoin into the mainstream financial system. The merits of this are debatable, but on the surface, that appears to be what these moves signify.
ETFs are popular investment vehicles, and the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs would open up new opportunities for institutional investors to participate in the bitcoin market within a regulated framework. While this comes at the cost of many of the inherent properties that make bitcoin valuable, institutions prefer the rails of regulation and are more likely to be trusting of firms like BlackRock. There are, of course, exceptions to this such as MicroStrategy, a company that holds its own bitcoin.]]></summary>

As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a correction may soon be coming for the cryptocurrency. The “exchange inflow mean” is an indicator that measures the mean amount of Bitcoin that’s currently being deposited into the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
This metric isn’t to be confused with the “exchange inflow,” which tells us the total amount of BTC going to these platforms. While the exchange inflow is useful, it may not provide an accurate picture of the trend being followed across the market, as only a few whales, who transfer huge amounts, can easily skew the metri…]]></summary>
