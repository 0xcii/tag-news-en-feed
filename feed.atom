According to Schiff, the current surge in BTC price is merely a temporary thing, and he believes that “the party” will soon come to an end.
 
Schiff’s skepticism stems from his belief that cryptocurrency lacks intrinsic value and is merely a speculative asset. As a gold bug, he advocates for investing in precious metals like gold, which he considers to be a more stable and reliable store of value. 
 
He often points out the historical significance and enduring value of gold, contrasting it with what he perceives as the volatility and u…]]></summary>
