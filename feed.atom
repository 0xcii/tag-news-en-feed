        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Judge Lewis Kaplan, the presiding judge in Sam  
Bankman-Fried’s case, has unveiled a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates who  
will be sworn in, marking the beginning of a trial that has garnered  
significant attention. 
The U.S. Prosecutors have filed multiple charges of fraud  
and conspiracy against Bankman-Fried following the collapse of his  
crypto-trading platform, FTX. Prosecutors allege that the 31-year-old  
entrepreneur misappropriated approximately $8 billion in customer funds. These  
funds were purportedly used to cover high-risk bets made by his crypto hedge  
fund, acquire luxury real estate in the Bahamas, and make substantial  
contributions to U.S. political campaigns.

While the current SHIB price, standing at $0.00000726 according to CoinGecko, might seem far away from this dream, the community remains steadfast in its hope.
 
A quick glance at the recent price trends reveals SHIB’s uphill battle. Over the last 24 hours, the token has experienced a minor decline of 0.4%, despite a modest seven-day price gain of 0.6%. The question looms large: how can SHIB traverse the monumental gap between its current value and the coveted one-cent milestone?
 
 
To reach $0.01, SHIB would need an astronomical surge. The exponential price increase required underscores the enormous challenge ahead. The community’s determination to achieve this re…]]></summary>

They also argued he can’t use his compliance with U.S. laws as proof of good faith.

In the Wednesday letter, federal prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan to reconsider or clarify a recent order limiting trial evidence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon surged to its strongest level since the end of August, as the token extended recent gains. The rally comes despite cryptocurrencies mostly consolidating on Wednesday, following recent declines. XRP was another notable gainer today.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) rose for a back-to-back session on Wednesday, hitting a multi-week high in the process.
 
MATIC/USD moved to an intraday high of $0.5937 in today’s session, which comes following a low of $0.5523 the day before.
 
This resulted in polygon climbing to its highest point since August 29, when the price peaked at $0.6355.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge saw the relative strength index (RSI) rise past a ceiling at the 62.00 zone.
 
Currently, the index is now at a reading of 62.76, with an upcoming resistance level at the 70.00 point.
 
A crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages also seems to be one of the reasons for today’s rally.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP was another big mover on Wednesday, as the price attempted to break out of a key resistance level.
 
After Tuesday’s low at $0.5075, XRP/USD rallied to an intraday high of $0.5449 during today’s session.
 
As a result of this surge, the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency briefly rose past a ceiling at $0.5400.
 
 
Earlier gains have since edged lower, which comes as the RSI fell below a ceiling at the 62.00 mark.
 
The index has since dropped further, and is now tracking at 56.57, and seems to be heading towards a floor of 51.00.
