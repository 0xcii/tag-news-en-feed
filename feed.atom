Hashrate Index has released its 2022 Bitcoin Mining Year In Review, an extensive report on the mining industry and markets surrounding it. 

2022 was a difficult year for Bitcoin mining, with the bear market leading to a hashprice all-time low, bankruptcies and losses for miners. Despite this, hash rate still grew 41%, and Bitcoin mining still generated nearly double the rewards compared to the previous three years. The report covers all of these topics and more in detail.
One of the main focuses of the report is the growth of hash rate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, a counsel for the bankrupt crypto trading venue FTX, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, stated that the company recovered more than $5 billion. However, the magnitude of consumer losses in its collapse was still unknown.
 
U.S. authorities have accused Bankman-Fried of organizing an “epic” scam that may have cost investors, clients, and lenders billions of dollars; the company’s valuation was $32 billion a year ago, but it filed for bankruptcy in November.
 
 
Andy Dietderich, an attorney for the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, says that the company has “recovered $5 billion in cash and liquid coins.” The full extent of the exchange’s client deficit is “still unclear” as they continue “working to rebuild transaction histories.”

Large Cap And Small Cap Altcoins Saw Flat Returns In The Past Month
 
According to the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, several alts have seen large short squeezes in recent days. The “altcoin indexes” here refer to groups of coins clubbed together on the criteria of market cap. The benefit of these indexes is that the performance of the different market sectors can be easily tracked using them.
 
There are three main indexes: the “small caps,” the “mid caps,” and the “large caps.” As their names already suggest, each of these represents the three major sizes of altcoins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the FTX bankruptcy case and fraud charges against co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried continue to unfold, the value of the exchange’s token, FTX Token (FTT), has seen significant growth. Since Jan. 9, 2023, FTT has risen 28.42% and currently sits above the $1 range, following a dip below that threshold.
 
FTT Token Jumps 28% Rising Above the $1 Threshold
 
The value of FTX’s exchange token, FTT, has seen a marked increase over the past two days. On Jan. 9, 2023, the coin reached $1.36 per unit. While some of those gains have been lost, FTT is currently holding above the $1 range at $1.22 per coin as of 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 11, 2023. The reason for this surge in value is uncertain, as FTT’s tokenomics are tied to the now-defunct FTX exchange and its potential future growth.

Most concerns were raised around the collateral used to back the coin and Binance itself has admitted to some flaws in the way that the peg was maintained.
 
Raising The Issues Around BUSD Peg
 
Questions around the pegging to the Binance BUSD first arose following the publication of an analysis of the Binance Smart Chain. In the section that touched on BUSD, Patrick Tan revealed that there were times in the past, when BUSD – specifically the BUSD on BSC, was not backed by an equivalent amount in dollars.

This follows the country’s commitment to becoming the world’s crypto hub.
 
With the UK increasing crypto adoption, the launch of a stablecoin appears to be an effort to further boost the adoption of crypto in the region. Andrew Griffith stated that the UK government has long been considering the establishment of a “regime for the wholesale use, for payment purposes, of stablecoins.”

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-atom-hits-2-month-high-as-xrp-extends-recent-gains/"/>
        <updated>2023-01-11T16:13:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cosmos rallied to a two-month high on Thursday, as cryptocurrency prices rebounded following Wednesday’s decline. Xrp was also mostly in the green in today’s session, extending recent gains in the process. The global crypto market cap is trading 0.17% higher as of writing.
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Cosmos (ATOM) raced to a two-month high on Wednesday, as the token climbed to its strongest point since November.
 
Following a low of $11.10, ATOM/USD raced to a peak of $11.44 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of this latest surge in price, cosmos moved to its highest point since Nov. 12.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s rally occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) ventured deeper into overbought territory.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average (MA), continued its upward ascent versus the 25-day (blue) MA.
 
However, sentiment could soon be shifting, with bears looking to re-enter the market as the RSI is now tracking at a level not seen since last January.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP (formerly ripple) was another big mover in today’s session, extending recent gains to a fourth consecutive day.
 
So far on Thursday, XRP/USD has risen to an intraday high of $0.3691, which comes less than a day after hitting a bottom of $0.348.
 
Following this rally, xrp neared a four-week high, as prices moved to their highest point since December 16.
 
 
This latest price surge comes as the RSI moved beyond a resistance point at 57.00, and it is currently tracking at 59.41.
 
As a result of this move, the 10-day (red) moving average is now close to a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should this upwards cross occur, it is likely that XRP will continue to move towards its long-term target of $0.40.
