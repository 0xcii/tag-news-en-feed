As a result, these vital network participants are being forced to offload their BTC holdings to offset the increasing operational costs.
 
Interestingly, the latest on-chain data shows that the Bitcoin market is experiencing a wave of capitulation from miners that is reminiscent of December 2022, barely a month after the FTX collapse. The question now is — what happened the last time and how could it impact the current cycle?

In May, the SEC abruptly approved the 19b-4 filings from eight prospective issuers of the Ethereum spot ETF, clearing the first step for the eventual introduction of these investment funds. In line with US regulations, the Commission is also expected to greenlight the S-1 forms of these proposed ETFs before trading can commence. For context, the S-1 forms contain information on an ETF’s investment objectives, strategies, risks, fees, etc.
