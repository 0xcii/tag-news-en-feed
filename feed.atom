One of them happens to be a common negative narrative that has plagued the Cardano network for some time now. 
 
Why ADA Holders Should Sell Their Tokens  
 
According to the report written by K33’s Head of Research, Anders Helseth, ADA holders should offload their ADA tokens because there is no “proof of Cardano being used for anything.” This, the report claims, is something that will, in the long run, affect ADA’s utility. 
 
 
Helseth noted that Cardano supporters may want to counter his assertion with an argument about how the network sees an average of around 90,000 daily transactions. However, he suggested this argumen…]]></summary>

As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, a large movement of dormant tokens has occurred on the Bitcoin blockchain during the past day.
 
The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Age Bands” (SOAB), which basically tells us about the amount of Bitcoin that each age band is transferring on the blockchain right now.
 
 
The age bands refer to groups of coins or investors divided based on the total time that they have been dormant. Coins that haven’t moved on the network since between six and 12 months ago, for example, would belong in the 6-month to 12-month a…]]></summary>
