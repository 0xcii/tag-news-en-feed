        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cosmos raced higher for a second straight session, after recently snapping a four-day losing streak. Friday’s move saw the token move closer to a key resistance level of $12.50. Solana also moved higher earlier in the day, as price bounced from a key support point. 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Cosmos (ATOM), was one of Friday’s notable gainers, as the token moved closer to a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $11.70 on Thursday, ATOM/USD raced to an intraday peak of $12.38 earlier today.
 
As a result of this move, cosmos moved towards a resistance point at the $12.50 level, which was last hit on Monday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also hovering near a ceiling of its own, at 66.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 65.85, which could lead to marginal consolidation, with earlier bulls opting to liquidate their positions.
 
However, should this aforementioned ceiling be broken, then it is likely that ATOM could move towards $13.00.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Like ATOM, solana (SOL) also edged higher, as the token continued to move away from a support point at $20.00.
 
SOL/USD rose to a high of $21.77 earlier in the session, and followed on from a low of $20.53 the day prior.
 
Today’s rally sees solana in a bullish attempt to regain market momentum, following recent declines in price.
 
 
As can be seen on the chart, the move took place despite the RSI remaining below its own ceiling at 68.00.
 
Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as traders seemed to be preparing for another reversal.
 
Currently solana is trading at $21.43, with longer-term bulls still likely targeting an exit at the $24.00 mark.

Robinhood Wallet Will Support Shiba Inu
 
On Thursday, the General Manager of Crypto for Robinhood, Johannn Kerbrat, took to Twitter to provide an update on the much-anticipated Robinhood Wallet. According to Kerbrat, the trading platform had begun rolling out the wallet to its over one million users on the waitlist.

Crypto undoubtedly had its worst year in 2022, with the overall global ownership increasing from just 36% to 39% in a quarter, despite that, the adoption of this particular asset class grew substantially among women.
