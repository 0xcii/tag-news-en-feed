        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e74f1b118de</id>
        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/ftxs-1-billion-sell-off-prompts-outflows-from-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-report/"/>
        <updated>2024-01-22T16:54:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the  
crypto market witnessed a surprising downturn after FTX unloaded a staggering  
$1 billion worth of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares. 
This unprecedented sell-off, primarily attributed to  
FTX's bankruptcy estate, now raises questions about the broader implications  
for the crypto landscape. According to a report by Coindesk, FTX is a significant  
contributor to the outflows amounting to more than $2 billion reported by the  
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).
Navigating Bitcoin ETF Space
CoinDesk's private data review unveiled that FTX  
disposed of 22 million shares, accounting for nearly $1 billion of the overall  
outflow. Despite high expectations surrounding the approval of Bitcoin ETFs,  
the market witnessed a decline in Bitcoin's price. 
FTX leveraged the price difference between GBTC and  
the value of the underlying Bitcoins. Holding 22.3 million GBTC valued at $597  
million in October 2023, FTX's move to liquidate its stake at $900 million  
coincided with Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF launch on January 11.
The aftermath saw a drop in Bitcoin's value,  
prompting a reevaluation of the impact of the approval of the ETFs.

However, recent weeks have seen a reduction of $960 million in the overall worth of the AI crypto sector.

AI Crypto Market Contracts
 
Since last year, the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency technologies has emerged as a significant trend. On Jan. 2, 2024, the market encompassing 82 AI-related crypto tokens attained a collective worth of $7.04 billion.

As of Jan. 22, 2024, ether has shown a notable decrease, registering a 3.3% drop in 24 hours and a 5.7% decline over the past week.
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum’s (ETH) market capitalization stands at $287 billion, a reflection of its significant presence in the crypto market. However, its 24-hour trading range of $2,364 to $2,479 and a 24-hour trade volume of $9.84 billion indicate a period of heightened volatility and trader caution. This is underscored by the current price of $2,380 per ETH, which is down from recent highs, suggesting a bearish sentiment among traders.

Bitcoin has come a dramatically long way, and with that comes a somewhat earned sense of optimism for those who have invested their time, money, and enthusiasm. 
Unfortunately this optimism, and sense of “inevitability” I have previously written on, has contributed to a culture of complacency.

As bitcoin hovers around $41,088, a meticulous analysis of its 1-hour, 4-hour, and daily chart unveils a predominantly bearish trend.
 
Bitcoin
 
Oscillators, key indicators of bitcoin’s momentum, and potential trend reversals present a mixed signal. The relative strength index (RSI) at 40 suggests a neutral to bearish stance, while the Stochastic at 12 and commodity channel index (CCI) at -120 also show a balancing act. However, the momentum indicator points to positivity at -2054, contrasting with the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) level at -484, which indicates a bearish outlook.

ETH Outperforms ETH Beta Tokens
 
According to an analysis carried out by Kaiko Research, the potential approval of a spot-based ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) is likely to be the crypto asset’s current “strongest narrative.” To support this assertion, the analysis points to bitcoin’s performance before the SEC approved a spot bitcoin ETF.

Potential Bitcoin Sellers
 
First, Hossainpour drew attention to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has seen its holdings reduce from 621,000 BTC to just under 580,000 BTC since the launch of their spot ETF. The trust’s high annual fee of 1.5 % compared to other providers such as Bitwise (0.2 %) and BlackRock (0.25 %) as well as Grayscale’s history are currently causing a massive sell-off, which is probably responsible for the current downward trend.

Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin has experienced a downward trend, with its value plummeting below the $42,000 mark after briefly touching $48,000 on January 11th.
 
Caution Signals Flash As Crypto Metrics Shift
 
One of the prominent metrics signaling caution is the Fear and Greed Index, which currently stands at 52, reflecting a neutral sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. However, historical patterns indicate that when the index enters the greed zone, a price correction often follows.
