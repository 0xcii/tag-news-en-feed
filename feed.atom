        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Bitcoin rocketing in value and Wall Street circling like a hawk, the US crypto industry is holding its breath as a crucial vote approaches in Washington next week. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or Fit21, could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets, potentially welcoming the industry into the fold or slamming the brakes on its recent growth spurt.
 
 
Fit21: A Lifeline Or A Leash?
 
Fit21 proposes a major shift in how the US government handles digital currencies. Currently, the regulatory landscape is fragmented, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) both having a say.
 
Fit21 would establish the CFTC as the primary regulator for crypto, giving the industry a clearer pictur…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heading into the year 2024, Bitcoin spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and the halving event were arguably the biggest narratives in the crypto space. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first BTC spot products in the US early on, driving the coin’s price to a new all-time high.
 
The halving event, on the other hand, has not exactly led to the highly-anticipated positive run for the Bitcoin price, which has rather struggled over the past few weeks. The premier cryptocurrency has witnessed a steady increase in its value over the past few days, slightly nullifying the period of stagnation seen in the past month.
