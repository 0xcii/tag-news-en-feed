The BALD memecoin, humorously named after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, launched on July 30 and took off on an unbelievable 290,000% gain within its first 24 hours. However, it wasn’t long before the euphoria turned sour as the anonymous deployer of BALD withdrew 10,705 ETH ($20 million) and 224.6 million BALD from liquidity, causing the token’s price to plummet by over 90%. Despite allegations of a ‘rug pull’, the deployer denied these accusations.
