Under the direction of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and the Frankfurt am Main Public Prosecutor’s Office, this operation emphasizes the continuous fight against financial crime in the digital world.
 
The supposedly anonymous transactions carried out by the exchanges enabled cybercriminals to hide dirty money with minimal oversight.
 
Significant Crackdown On Illegal Trade
 
Dubbed “Operation Final Exchange,” the crackdown exposes the degree to which these websites operated outside the bounds of law. Many of them disregarded required “Know Your Customer” (KYC) rules, which demand companies to confirm client identities.

Why Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Prices Are Up
 
Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have experienced a significant surge due to the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point (bps) interest rate cut. This has provided bullish momentum for risk assets, including these meme coins, as investors are now more confident in allocating more capital to them. 
 
 
Before now, the price of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu had stagnated due to a lack of significant demand for these coins. This was also evident in the broader crypto market, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which failed to hold above $60,…]]></summary>
