        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The hallowed halls of academia are embracing the digital age, with the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Business Administration (HWZ) announcing a one-of-its-kind Bitcoin course.
 
Launching in March 2025, this program promises to be the first of its kind in Europe, offering a comprehensive exploration of Bitcoin for business professionals. However, the hefty price tag of the course has left some members of the cryptocurrency community feeling more like spectators at a “fiat faucet failure” than potential enrollees.
