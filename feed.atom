The suit claims that Musk operated a pyramid scheme, following his endorsements of dogecoin. Litecoin was another token to climb on Saturday. 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) climbed higher on Saturday after lawyers for Elon Musk requested that a lawsuit filed against him by investors in the meme coin be dropped.
 
In a statement, Musk’s lawyers said, “There is nothing unlawful about tweeting words of support for, or funny pictures about, a legitimate cryptocurrency that continues to hold a market cap of nearly $10 billion.”
 
Following a low of $0.07456 on Friday, DOGE/USD rose to a peak of $0.07841 to start the weekend.
 
 
As a result of the move, the meme coin marginally breakout of a long-term ceiling of $0.0780.
 
This came as the relative strength index (RSI) also briefly moved beyond a resistance of its own at 52.00
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 51.99, with earlier gains in DOGE mostly easing.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was another notable gainer to start the weekend, as the token also neared a one-week high.
 
LTC/USD surged to an intraday high of $93.85, less than 24 hours after prices were trading at a low of $88.34.
 
This rally sent litecoin to its strongest point since last Sunday, March 26, when it rose to a peak at $94.92.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s gain pushed LTC close to a point of resistance at $94.00, however, bulls have so far been unable to force a breakout.
 
This is likely due to the 14-day RSI hovering close to a ceiling of its own, at the 57.00 mark.
 
Should bulls move beyond this point, then there is a good chance that LTC will move beyond $94.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was back in the green on Saturday, as prices moved close to the $29,000 level to start the weekend. Following a volatile session on Friday, cryptocurrency markets were mostly higher entering April. Ethereum moved back above the $1,800 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rose towards $29,000 on Saturday, as markets continued to react to yesterday’s personal consumption expenditure (PCE) figures in the United States.
 
PCE climbed to 0.3% in March, less than the 0.4% markets were expecting, showing that inflation was slowing.
 
BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $28,802.46 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after trading at a low of $27,854.63.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move saw BTC briefly breakout of a long-term resistance level of $28,500.
 
Earlier gains have since declined, which comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failed to move beyond a ceiling at 65.00.
 
As of writing this, the index is now tracking at 63.65, with a floor at 62.00 a possible target for sellers.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also higher to start the weekend, with prices once again climbing above teh $1,800 level.
 
Following a low of $1,789.76 on Friday, ETH/USD raced to a peak at $1,844.68 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency jumped over a ceiling at the $1,825 zone.
 
 
From the chart, this seemingly coincided with the RSI breaking free of a resistance of its own at 59.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now at the 60.15 mark, with the next visible ceiling around the 62.00 region.
 
Should the RSI move closer to this point, ethereum bulls will send prices towards a long-term target of $1,900.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP, the cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, has experienced significant price growth in recent weeks, registering an increase of 14% in the last week alone. This marks an appreciation of over 40% for the asset in the last 30 days, positioning it as the cryptocurrency that has seen the highest increase in price across the entire market in the last seven days. 
 
 
According to the CoinMarketCap, XRP rose from $0.44 to $0.54 during this period, partly driven by increased trading on South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly Korbit and Bithumb, where XRP was the most traded crypto asset on the platforms in the last 24 hours. This positive trend has been linked to increased confidence from investors amid the backdrop of the current lawsuit with the SEC.

According to a post via their official Twitter handle, Bittrex states that this move comes as a result of the ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding the U.S. crypto space.
 
Ironically, Bittrex’s sad announcement comes amidst the company’s celebration of its ninth anniversary. The crypto exchange has assured its U.S. customers that all funds are safe and immediately available for withdrawal. 
 
Trading is expected to continue until April 14, 2023, although users are advised to have fully withdrawn their assets from the platform by April 30, 2023. It is worth stating that this closure is restricted to the U.S. alone as Bittrex operations will cont…]]></summary>

Lueth argues that instead of “locking users in,” the metaverse should usher in “a future where they are free to move between platforms and can easily take their assets and identity with them.”
 
‘Walled Garden Systems’ Not Sustainable
 
While interest in the metaverse has seemingly dissipated as evidenced by Meta’s decision to focus on artificial intelligence (AI), Dirk Lueth argues that AI tools can still “provide very interesting enhancements for the metaverse in general.” The Upland co-founder also told Bitcoin.com News what he thinks about “infinite land” metaverses and scarcity.
