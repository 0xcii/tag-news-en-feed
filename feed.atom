        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana rose by as much as 20% Saturday, as crypto markets came alive to start the weekend. The token hit a 12-week high in today’s session, breaking out of a key price ceiling in the process. Cardano also rose to its strongest point since November, with the global cryptocurrency market cap up 6.86% as of writing.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL), was one of Saturday’s notable gainers, as the token rose by as much as 20% in today’s session.
 
SOL/USD hit a high of $26.41 to start the weekend, which follows on from Friday’s low at $21.27.
 
As a result of this move, solana broke out of a key resistance level of $25.00, hitting its strongest point since November 8 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also broke out of a ceiling of its own at the 73.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 73.84, with the next visible resistance at the 81.00 zone.
 
If bulls were to collide with this wall, then it is likely that solana could move above the $30.00 point.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Another big mover on the weekend was cardano (ADA), which also moved to its strongest point since November.
 
Following a low of $0.3364 on Saturday, ADA/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.3726 earlier today.
 
This surge saw cardano jump to its strongest point in the past 12 weeks, breaking out of a resistance of $0.3650 in the process.
 
 
As can be seen on the chart, the move took price strength to a ceiling of 73.00, however, it has so far failed to overcome this hurdle.
 
Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as traders moved to secure gains, leading to ADA currently trading at $0.366.
 
Should this obstacle be eventually overcome, the next target for ADA bulls will likely be $0.40.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin surged to a five-month high to start the weekend, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. Prices of the world’s largest digital currency rose above $23,000, rebounding from a recent drop towards $20,000. Ethereum also rallied, as it hit its strongest point since September.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) raced past the $23,000 level to start the weekend, with prices climbing to a multi-month high.
 
Following a low of $20,961.21 on Friday, BTC/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $23,249.89 earlier today.
 
Today’s rally saw bitcoin jump to its highest level since August 24, when price at the time was trading at a top of $23,600.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved back towards a ceiling of 90.00.
 
Currently, the index is at the 86.30 level, with earlier gains somewhat fading, as traders move to secure profits.
 
As of writing, BTC is trading at $22,902.03, which is still roughly 9.27% higher than yesterday’s low.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Like bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also surged on Saturday, as it climbed to its highest mark in the last four months.
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,674.18 earlier in the day, which comes following a bottom of $1,550.03 on Friday.
 
As a result of the move, ethereum recaptured a high not seen since September 13, which is the last time it traded over $1,700.
 
 
Although prices are currently below this threshold, the resurgence of bullish momentum on Saturday could lead to further surges this weekend.
 
The surge has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average back into an uptrend, extending its distance from its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Overall, ethereum is up 6.28% as of writing.
