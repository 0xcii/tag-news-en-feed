        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the last crypto bull market, Dogecoin was a clear leader among altcoins and beat Bitcoin by miles in terms of return on investment (ROI).
 
Could this old dog be up to it’s same tricks? The meme coin is mere pennies away from triggering a “parabolic” signal that the last time around resulted in a 25,000% gain.
 
Why Dogecoin Could Become A Bull-Dog
 
Dogecoin has lost a large share of its former value alongside the rest of the crypto industry. This is common during a bear market. But during a bull market, the returns have historically been shocking.
 
 
The meme coin became the poster child of the last crypto bull run, famously being mentioned numerous times during Elon Musk’s Saturday Night Live performance.
 
That event was close to the peak of the previous cycle, and since then has been rolling over and playing dead. Soon, it could bite back. That is according to the Parabolic SAR indicator on the 1M DOGEUSD chart.
 

 
 
DOGE Closes In On Parabolic Buy Trigger
 
The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator created by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. who also created such tools as the Relative Strength Index, the Average Directional Index, and Average True Range.
 
The tool is used to tell a trader or investor that the trend has “stopped and reversed”. If DOGEUSD can tag the Parabolic SAR on the 1M timeframe, it could tell the market that the trend has officially changed.
 
 
The reason this is important, is because Dogecoin is typically an indication that altcoin season is approaching. When it begins to take off, so does the rest of the altcoin market. At least it has always historically done so.
 
A buy signal has only been triggered three times in the past, causing a 500%, 225%, and 25,000% rally, respectively. Will this signal once again prove as reliable as man’s best friend?

Stablecoin Regulatory Framework
 
Singapore’s Central Bank has released a finalized regulatory framework that will regulate stablecoin issuers in the country. This latest regulation stipulates key requirements for entities regulated in the country to perform stablecoin-related services such as issuance and custody. 
 
 
In October 2022, the regulator released a consultation paper on its proposed framework to regulate stablecoin issuers and intermediaries in the country. As part of efforts to develop an all-encompassing framework, it invited comments from the relevant stakeholders and …]]></summary>

During the latest bitcoin bull market, prices for bitcoin mining machines, otherwise known as ASICs, witnessed a significant surge. This was followed by a major crash, bottoming in December 2022. The value of ASICs tend to have a pattern: They seem to be undervalued during bear markets, while enjoying outperformance during bull runs. This pattern points to a potential profit shift when measured in bitcoin terms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin mostly consolidated on Tuesday, as traders anticipated the release of July’s retail sales data from the United States. Sales rose by 0.7%, better than the 0.4% expected, and this comes following a 0.2% increase in June. Ethereum also remained unchanged prior to the data.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was trading in the red for the majority of the day, as price consolidated prior to the release of U.S. retail sales data.
 
After peaking at $29,660.25 to start the week, BTC/USD fell to a low of $29,272.35 earlier in today’s session.
 
Since moving above $30,000 on August 8, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has mostly trended sideways.
 
 
One reason for a lack of direction appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI) tracking between a support and resistance of its own.
 
The index is currently at a reading of 47.57, and has mostly moved between a floor at 47.00, and ceiling at 49.00 in recent days.
 
For bulls, a breakout above the 49.00 zone will also likely be the straw needed to break the camel’s back.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) has remained largely unchanged in the past few days, rising by 0.11% in the past week.
 
ETH/USD bottomed out at $1,837.21 so far during today’s session, which is almost $20.00 lower than Monday’s high.
 
Price has mostly consolidated around a support point of $1,830 in recent days, however the prospect of a moving average crossover is keeping bullish hopes alive.
 
 
The 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages are on the cusp of an upwards crossover, which could likely send prices above $1,900.
 
Similar to BTC, there will first need to be a breakout above a ceiling on the RSI indicator for this to take place.
 
On this occasion the resistance point is at 47.00, and the index is currently tracking at 45.23.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Trust, a prominent name in the world of crypto custodial services, has taken the unexpected step of filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware. This move comes after the company encountered a significant shortfall in customer funds.
 
In the filing made on August 15, Prime Trust, LLC, Prime Core Technologies Inc., Prime Digital LLC, and Prime IRA LLC were named as the entities seeking Chapter 11 relief. 
 
 
The company’s decision was prompted by its recognition of a distressing reality: liabilities ranging between $100 million to $500 million, compared to assets estimated at $50 million to $100 million. 
 
This substantial gap underlines the severity of the financial challenges the company is currently facing.

Throughout American economic history, there has been a constant drive toward centralization, as evidenced by the many attempts to establish a central bank in the United States. From Alexander Hamilton's “Federalist Papers” to President Andrew Jackson's fierce battle against the Second Bank of the United States and the ultimate creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, the allure of consolidating financial power has shaped the nation's monetary landscape. 
However, amid the fervor for a centralized monetary authority, there is a cautionary note: Be wary of the erosion of financial privacy. The concentration of financial control leads to less individual sovereignty, as the watchful ey…]]></summary>
