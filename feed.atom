Market volume was relatively low in today’s session, as a result of the U.S. Labor Day celebration. Ethereum was slightly higher, as the price managed to remain above $1,600. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was trading below $26,000 on Labor Day, as volume in the cryptocurrency market was mostly lower.
 
BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $25,817.03 to start the week, following a high of $26,087.15 the day prior.
 
The decline pushed bitcoin closer to a collision with support at $25,600, however bulls have so far rejected this retracement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, appears to be on shaky ground as it heads into September, historically a challenging month for the digital asset. 
 
The uncertainty stems from a combination of factors, including the latest decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and broader macroeconomic concerns.
 
August concluded with Bitcoin experiencing a setback as it relinquished its gains following the SEC’s decision to delay its ruling on a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). 
 
This regulatory delay has raised questions about the timing of potential mainstream adoption of Bitcoin investment vehicles.

In a world where technological progress has sprinted from hard industries to consumer-facing revolutions, it’s now in the hands of service-oriented high-tech sectors like robotics, advanced software, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing.
 
OpenAI’s ChatGPT recently made headlines, reaching 100 million users in just two months, even outpacing TikTok’s adoption rate record of nine months. Yet, challenges faced by crypto, Web3, and blockchain technologies in 2022 prompted the need for fresh perspectives and strategies to clarify and elevate their value proposition to the real economy.
 
The solution? The Hourglass Collective.

Both crypto related events as well as notable macro data are very scarce this week. The most important macro data are the ISM Services PMI (on Wednesday 10:00 am EST) and the initial jobless claims (on Thursday at 8:30 am EST). However, neither event is likely to have a significant impact on the dollar index (DXY) and thus Bitcoin and crypto.
 
Due to this, we are making an exception this Monday and looking at the entire month of September rather than the upcoming seven days in our weekly preview. September holds several extremely important events in store, and could also provide a few surprises.

According to the court filing dated September 1, Ripple stated that the SEC doesn’t have the right to an appeal as the “exceptional circumstances” required for it are absent. 
 
The SEC had earlier argued that an appeal was necessary because it involved controlling questions of law. The regulator also cited how Judge Torres’ ruling could affect its case against Terraform, Coinbase, and Binance.
