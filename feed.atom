        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ava Labs, the primary developer behind the Avalanche blockchain, recently announced a significant reduction in its workforce, affecting approximately 12% of its employees.

I have taught teenagers mathematics for my entire career. More recently, I also found great joy in teaching people about Bitcoin. Among the lessons I have learned through the years is that in order for a student to truly learn a new and challenging concept, they need to feel comfortable and have a voice in their learning process. Today, the most effective teachers are able to foster a dynamic community of engaged students that have agency in what and how they learn. But this wasn’t always so.

Bitcoin Hashrate Rise May Suggest Miners Are Gearing Up For Next Bull Run
 
The “mining hashrate” is a metric that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that’s connected to the Bitcoin blockchain right now. The metric is measured in terms of “hashes per second” (H/s), where a “hash” is basically a function the BTC miners have to perform on the network.
 
As the cryptocurrency’s hashrate has grown quite large by now, much larger units like terahashes per second (TH/s) or exahashes per second (EH/s) are used instead these days.
