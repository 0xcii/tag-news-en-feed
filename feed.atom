From the start, Samourai Wallet have been transparent about their services. They provided their code fully open sourced and explained every public service they ran. All of this was done in public for everyone to see as they, ironically enough, had nothing to hide.
As will be detailed below, they followed the law to the letter as was laid out in government legislation and guidelines. The key point was that Samourai Wallet's code allowed users to make transactions as they saw fit, without ever holding so much as a single sat of the user in their own possession.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia's largest stock market, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), approved listing the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on its platform on June 20. The issuer will be VanEck, and the instrument will be dubbed the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (VBTC).

BREAKING: 🇦🇺 Australia’s largest stock exchange, ASX has approved its first spot #Bitcoin ETF. pic.twitter.com/M4kApaqfhW
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 17, 2024
  
  
  
The decision of the leading Australian stock exchange came after the success of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, where 11 such instruments have been listed since January. Hong Kong also launched Bitcoin ETFs following the US.
Arian Neiron, CEO and Managing Director at VanEck Asia Pacific, said, "The demand for access to Bitcoin via a listed vehicle traded on ASX has been increasing, and many of our clients have told us that their clients are already positioned to have an allocation ready to invest."
Australia already had spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the first to debut in Australia was the Global X 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (EBTC), which launched in April 2022. Most recently, the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) was approved and began trading on June 4 on Australia's second-largest stock exchange, the Cboe Australia exchange.
The arrival of a Bitcoin ETF on Australia's main exchange is a significant milestone. As the country's largest stock exchange, the ASX brings greater visibility, credibility, and access to Bitcoin exposure for both institutional and retail investors.
These approvals indicate a growing acceptance and interest in Bitcoin investment products within the Australian market and worldwide, and most countries will likely follow suit.]]></summary>

The renowned finance author is known to be a huge advocate of digital assets and again made a case for them while making this revelation. 
 
The “Easiest Way” To Become A Millionaire
 
Kiyosaki mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin is the easiest way to become a millionaire. He highlighted how making millions as an entrepreneur can be. The renowned finance author noted that one has to be “really smart, dedicated, and lucky” to become a millionaire while starting their own business. As such, Kiyosaki claims he saves BTC instead because the flagship crypto does the hard work for him, which is why he loves Bitcoin.
