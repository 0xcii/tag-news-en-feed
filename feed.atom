        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has partnered with  
CoinDesk to track spot Bitcoin  
prices. This collaboration aims to bridge traditional finance with  
cryptocurrency and offer investors ways to engage with digital assets. The partnership involves cash-settled index options tracking the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX). 
Introducing Bitcoin Index Options
Jon Herrick, the Chief Product Officer of the New York  
Stock Exchange, mentioned: "As traditional institutions and everyday  
investors are demonstrating their wide-ranging enthusiasm for the recent  
approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, the New York Stock Exchange is excited to  
announce its collaboration with CoinDesk Indices. Upon regulatory approval,  
these options contracts will offer investors access to an important liquid and  
transparent risk-management tool."
Options contracts tied to the XBX enable investors to access an avenue for managing risk and exposure  
to Bitcoin's price movements. While the development of these options contracts  
is underway, they are subject to regulatory approvals. It aims to ensure  
compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
XBX is a benchmark for tracking Bitcoin's spot price.  
With approximately $20 billion in ETF assets under management tied to XBX, the  
benchmark shows Bitcoin's value in real-time across various cryptocurrency  
exchanges. Its continuous calculation and publication occur once per second.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Deaton has been a vocal critic of the SEC’s strategy, particularly highlighting its actions against companies like Ripple, LBRY, and Coinbase. He contends that the SEC’s relentless pursuit of Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen exemplifies a harmful and antagonistic regulatory stance that could have long-lasting negative impacts on the industry.

BREAKING: 🇺🇸 New York Stock Exchange to launch financial products tracking spot #Bitcoin prices. pic.twitter.com/mhPECUZAsW
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 29, 2024
 
 
 
The XBX is a real-time spot price index for Bitcoin calculated across major crypto exchanges. It has been operating for over 10 years and is currently the benchmark for $20 billion worth of Bitcoin ETF assets.
By developing options contracts based on the XBX, the NYSE aims to provide investors with a new tool to manage risk as interest in Bitcoin continues growing. The products would be subject to regulatory approval.
NYSE Chief Product Officer Jon Herrick said these new options contracts will give investors "access to an important liquid and transparent risk-management tool" amid surging demand for Bitcoin.
The collaboration brings another major traditional finance player into Bitcoin. The NYSE said it shows the "wide-ranging enthusiasm" for the recent spot bitcoin ETF approvals drawing institutions into the asset class.

Currently, the CME and a handful of other mainstream entities offer Bitcoin derivatives products. The NYSE entering the mix provides additional credibility and signals growing acceptance of Bitcoin in traditional finance circles.
With $25 trillion in market capitalization, the NYSE brings extensive reach, distribution and influence to the table. Its entrance into Bitcoin indexing and derivatives reflects the asset class going increasingly mainstream in 2024.]]></summary>
