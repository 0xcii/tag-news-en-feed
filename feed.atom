There have been three waves of layoffs at Meta, the most recent of which occurred in May. There have been two prior waves of layoffs, the first in November when 11,000 people were affected and the second in December when another 10,000 people lost their jobs.
 
Reduced advertising income and a precipitous drop in stock price necessitated these terminations. It has been reported that an internal corporate memo stated that the company has informed managers to be ready to announce the retrenchments.

Bowman’s Privacy Concerns Over Digital Dollar 
 
Privacy concerns surrounding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) like the digital dollar remain contentious. Experts suggest that a CBDC would leave a trail of records similar to those left by digital payment systems, leaving users vulnerable to surveillance. 
 
Speaking on this topic during a recent speech at Georgetown University, Bowman stressed the need to ensure that consumer data privacy protections remain in place when transitioning to future payment systems. 
 
 
However, some industry experts argue that privacy concerns around CBDCs are unfounded. Dur…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin saw a five-day winning streak snapped on Wednesday, with today’s drop engulfing recent gains. The meme coin fell by as much as 6% in today’s session, as sentiment in the crypto market shifted. Solana was also lower, plunging by 9%.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) plunged on Wednesday, as bears entered the market, snapping a five-day win streak in the process.
 
Following a low of $0.0853 last Friday, DOGE/USD surged to a peak of $0.0950 during yesterday’s session.
 
These gains were wiped today, as the meme coin fell to a low of $0.0851 earlier in the day.
 
 
One of the main catalysts for the drop seems to be a breakout on the relative strength index (RSI), which fell below a floor at 60.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 54.98, which is marginally higher than a floor at 53.00.
 
DOGE has since rebounded, and is currently at $0.08815, however should the RSI continue to fall, the coin could move below $0.0850.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Another notable mover on Wednesday was solana (SOL), which fell by as much as 9% today.
 
SOL/USD dropped to a bottom at $22.27 earlier in the day, which comes following Tuesday’s peak at $25.22.
 
As a result of the decline, solana fell to its weakest point since last Tuesday, when the token traded at a low of $20.83.
 
 
Like with dogecoin, today’s drop seems to have coincided with a breakout on the RSI indicator, which moved below 57.00.
 
Price strength is currently at a reading of 53.36, and is fast approaching a lower point of support at 51.00.
 
If this downturn continues for the remainder of the week, there is a strong possibility that SOL will move below $20.00.

Crypto Futures Market Has Seen Liquidations Of Around $236 Million In Last 24 Hours
 
A “liquidation” occurs when a futures contract holder’s bet fails and the price moves in the loss direction just enough that a certain percentage of the margin (the initial collateral) is drained, leading to the derivative exchange to forcibly close or “liquidate” the position.
 
One factor that can significantly increase the risk of a contract getting liquidated is the degree of leverage the investor has opted for. “Leverage” here refers to a loan amount that’s often many times the initial position itself.
