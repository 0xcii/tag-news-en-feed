        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the time of writing, we are now less than 80 days away from Bitcoin’s fourth halving event, where the block reward will decrease from 6.25 bitcoins per block to 3.125 bitcoins per block post-halving. As is customary, market expectations have swelled, fueling speculation about whether the 2024 halving will diverge from its predecessors.
 
Anticipation for the Next Bitcoin Halving Grows
 
Based on current statistics and utilizing Bitcoin’s intended ten-minute block average, the fourth Bitcoin halving is just 78 days from today, scheduled for around April 21, 2024. However, the exact date remains elusive due to the variable nature of block times, which can either accelerate or decelerate the process.

The new Qtum roadmap for 2024 will pioneer Qtum’s first USDC token swaps with a token bridge, support for Bitcoin Ordinals, and upstream support to Qtum Core. These new features are likely to open the DeFi floodgates, significantly increase chain volume, and attract developers.
 
Nearly one decade ago, Qtum began its journey to merge the advantages of the two biggest blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, Qtum, an open-source blockchain platform, offers robust tools for building and deploying decentralized applications while ensuring high-quality security using the energy-efficient, proof-of-stake consensus model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a surprising move, the upcoming Super Bowl LVIII is set to showcase a lineup of commercials that veer away from the tech-focused ads that have dominated recent years. Instead, viewers can expect a return to traditional themes of amusement and comedy during the highly anticipated event where the Kansas City Chiefs will face off against the San Francisco 49ers on February 11.
 
Renowned companies such as BMW, DoorDash, Budweiser, State Farm, and Oreo have secured slots for the big game, opting to tap into the broader appeal of traditional Super Bowl ad themes.
 
 
Super Bowl: Tech Exit, Brands Persist
 
This shift marks a departure from the sporadic presence of emerging technology sectors like cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence in previous years, except for 2023.
