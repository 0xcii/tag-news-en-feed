        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-shib-slip-on-monday-as-traders-capture-recent-gains/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-26T15:35:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin dropped by nearly 3% on Monday, as traders began to take profits following last week’s gains. Cryptocurrency largely consolidated to start the week, with the global market cap down 0.64% as of writing. Shiba inu was another coin to move lower today.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was in the red to start the week, as traders seemingly secured gains following a recent bull run.
 
DOGE/USD rose to a two-week high at $0.0704 last Thursday, however it has since gone on to record consecutive declines.
 
The latest drop pushed the meme coin to an intraday low of $0.06557, which is its weakest point since Saturday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s sell-off comes as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a support point at 50.70.
 
Since the decline, the index is now tracking at 48.55, with the next visible floor being at the 46.00 mark.
 
In the event that this level gets breached, there is a strong chance that DOGE will drop below $0.0640.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Another meme coin to fall lower on Monday was shiba inu (SHIB), which slipped following its own recent rally.
 
Following a high of $0.000007907 on Sunday, SHIB/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.000007684 in today’s session.
 
Like with dogecoin, shiba inu also captured a multi-week high last week, however, sentiment shifted after the RSI hit a hurdle.
 
 
Price strength failed to break out of a resistance level of 54.00, and as of writing is currently tracking at 50.43.
 
Despite this bearish signal, a potential upwards crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages is on the cusp of occurring.
 
Should this take place, it is likely that SHIB gains further in the upcoming week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HSBC, Hong Kong’s largest bank, has made a historic move by opening its doors to cryptocurrency investments. The bank has reportedly started offering its customers access to Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) listed on the Hong Kong exchange. 
 
This marks the first time a bank in Hong Kong has permitted such transactions, broadening the scope of cryptocurrency exposure for its local clients. As reported by Asian reporter Wu Blockchain, HSBC’s move is poised to have a significant impact on crypto accessibility within the Hong Kong financial market. 
 
Notably, this is a clear signal that traditional banking institutions are increasingly acknowledging the viability of digital currencies as part of a comprehensive investment portfolio.

So far this year, a total of eight block rewards from the 2010 era have been transferred out of wallets for the first time in more than 12 years. Two of them occurred on Monday, June 26, 2023, after the blockchain parser Btcparser.com detected the movements. Both block rewards were obtained on July 12, 2010, suggesting that the two block subsidies were owned by the same individual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Analysts foresee a potential breakout as Bitcoin (BTC) grabs the positive market sentiment generated from BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF filing. This comes as the BTC price has remained above $30,000 despite a slight correction in the crypto market over the past few days. 
 
A notable crypto market analyst, Aksel Kabir, predicts a significant price surge for the number one crypto asset is imminent. According to Kabir, BTC will hit a target price of $34,000 after conquering the short-term resistance at $31,000.
 
 
Kabir based his analysis on the head and shoulders (H&S) pattern. It indicated a strong bullish sentiment in the market, which could see BTC reaching the $34,000 target after the breakout from the channel.

It was revealed that Kim Nam-kuk possessed approximately 800,000 Wemix coins in 2021, valued at approximately 6 billion won ($4.5 million). 
 
This substantial amount of wealth appeared incongruous with his reputation for being frugal, raising suspicions about the source of the funds and the possibility of insider trading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The National Tax Agency of Japan released an updated version of its corporate tax guidelines, introducing significant changes to the crypto taxation rules for digital token issuers. This revision focuses explicitly on eliminating taxes on unrealized gains derived from crypto assets issued by companies. And the tax exemption is set to take effect nearly six months later.
 
Since August of the previous year, legislators in Japan have engaged in discussions regarding new tax regulations for digital assets. These discussions were part of a wider tax reform agenda for 2023. However, only this week did the tax authority finally approve the new crypto tax rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below $31,000 to start the week, as traders seemingly moved to secure gains, as the cryptocurrency became overbought. The relative strength index (RSI) rose to its highest point since January, prompting bears to reenter the market. Ethereum also declined, falling below $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved marginally lower to start the week, as price fell below the $31,000 mark on Monday.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $30,042.38 earlier in the day, which comes after price peaked above $31,000 on Sunday.
 
Today’s slippage sees bitcoin decline for a third straight day, and comes as the relative strength index (RSI) moved into overbought territory.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Over the weekend, the index hit a peak of 72.92, which was not only near a ceiling of 73.00, but also its highest point since late January.
 
This reading prompted bears to once again enter the market, pushing the RSI down to a current reading of 68.81.
 
The next visible floor appears to be at 68.00, and in the event this support point is broken, there is a good chance that BTC slips below $30,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH), for its part, was unable to remain above a key price level of $1,900 during Monday’s session.
 
Following a high of $1,920.08 on Sunday, ETH/USD dropped by 2% today, hitting a bottom of $1,870.30 in the process.
 
The cryptocurrency has since marginally rebounded, and as of writing is trading at $1,882.04.

A key reason for the turbulence remains the fact that price strength has been unable to move past a ceiling at 61.00.
 
Overall, momentum in ethereum has turned bearish following a failed attempt to move above a ceiling at $1,930.
 
In addition to this, the RSI fell below a floor at 58.00, with a current reading at 57.75.

And one more disclaimer: I have not been to many Bitcoin conferences, so my takes and impressions from BTC Prague might be old news for some of you. However, I do believe that it was the first “huge” Bitcoin conference not only for myself, but also for countless others from Central Europe, so it might be nice to sum up the whole experience.

Bitcoin Rally Has Taken A Large Number Of Short-Term Holders Into Profit
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, 2.6 million coins held by the short-term holders are now carrying some unrealized profit. The “short-term holders” (STHs) here refer to all those investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago.
 
Statistically, the longer an investor holds their coins, the less likely they become to sell said coins at any point. Thus, since the STHs haven’t been holding their coins since that long ago, they are the weak hands of the market who may easily sell at the sight of FUD or profit-taking opportun…]]></summary>
