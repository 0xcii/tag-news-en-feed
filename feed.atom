Bitcoin MVRV Momentum Could Reveal Buying Opportunity For BTC
 
As analyst Ali explained in a new post on X, the MVRV Momentum has been pointing out buying opportunities for the cryptocurrency since the current bull run started.
 
The MVRV ratio is a popular Bitcoin on-chain indicator that compares the asset’s market cap against its realized cap. The realized cap refers to a capitalization model for the asset that, in short, keeps track of the actual capital the holders as a whole have used to buy their coins.
 
As such, one way to look at the MVRV ratio is to compare the value the holders are carrying right now (that is, the market cap) with what …]]></summary>
