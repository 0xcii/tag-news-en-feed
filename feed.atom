On May 7, 2023, the number of unconfirmed transactions reached an all-time high of over 500,000 transfers, causing a major backlog. However, as of today, that number has been reduced to 263,406. Currently, 184 blocks need to be cleared to process the majority of transactions that are still stuck in the network’s mempool. 
 
Congestion Woes Ease on Bitcoin Network
 
The long queue of transactions is finally starting to subside as bitcoin miners have started catching up with some of the backlog. As we reported three days ago, Bitcoin.com News noted the beginning of the congestion-clearing process, with unconfirmed transactions dropping from over 500,000 on May 7 to just above 300,000 on Thursday, May …]]></summary>

Author’s note: This is a politically-incorrect article because I’m about to make gross generalizations about men and women. If you are easily offended, you probably shouldn’t read on.
When I first entered the Bitcoin space, I met a woman who asked me if I was interested in starting a woman’s Bitcoin meetup. 
“I wish there was one,” she said. 
At the time, I was a bit offended by the idea. 
“Bitcoin is already a small space, why would we want to separate men and women?” I wondered. 
Since then, I’ve had a change of heart.

For merchants, Web3 payments come with the added benefit of what Miller called protection from “fraudulent chargebacks.”
 
Crypto Payments Trump Traditional Payment Methods
 
To back his assertions, Miller claimed many of the merchants that are presently experimenting with or encouraging their customers to use Web3 payments are doing so because they are seeking a better deal than what they are getting from traditional payment providers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana rose by as much as 5% in today’s session, as cryptocurrencies began to recover from Friday’s red wave. The global market cap was up by nearly 2% at the time of writing. Chainlink also rose, moving back above a key resistance level.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) moved back above the $20.00 mark to start the weekend, as the token rose by as much as 5% today.
 
Following a low of $19.81 on Friday, SOL/USD jumped to an intraday peak at $21.25 on Saturday.
 
The rebound came as solana collided with an interim floor at $19.90, which has acted as the last line of defense following breakout below $20.00.
 
 
Looking at the chart, there was a similar rebound at the same point on April 10, which then led SOL to going on a six-day win streak.
 
Saturday’s rally also came as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped beyond a ceiling at the 45.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 46.49, with the next visible point of resistance at 50.00.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) also moved higher in today’s session, with price breaking out of a key price point.
 
LINK/USD raced to a high of $6.63 to start the weekend, hours after falling to a low of $6.37.
 
Today’s jump in price has seen chainlink move above a long-term ceiling of $6.50, after trading above this mark for the last two-months.
 
 
From the chart, the rise has seen price strength rise to a ceiling of its own at 42.00, however it has so far failed to move beyond this level.
 
Price strength is now at a reading of 41.20, with a support point at 40.00, in the event momentum begins to shift.
 
A slight shift has already occurred, with LINK now trading at $6.58, which is marginally below earlier highs.

Then, Former President Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy are on the other side of the aisle.
If you have been following the race so far, you might know that Trump seems to be walking away with the nomination before the process even starts next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin bounced back from a near two-month low on Saturday, as bulls moved in to buy the recent dip in price. Saturday’s move came as the cryptocurrency rebounded from a recent support point, after yesterday’s breakout. Ethereum was also higher, climbing above $1,800.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved away from a recent two-month low on Saturday, as bulls opted to buy the recent dip.
 
After falling to a low of $25,878.43 on Friday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $26,989.07 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s rebound sees bitcoin jump back above a key support point at $26,500, following Friday’s breakout.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that this took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) found a floor of its own at 36.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 37.99, with a ceiling at 43.00 a possible target.
 
Should bulls lead the charge to this point, it is likely that bitcoin will be back above the $27,000 level this weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was back above a key price level to start the weekend, as it once again rose above the $1,800 mark.
 
ETH/USD hit a peak of $1,816.06 in today’s session, less than 24 hours after declining to a low at $1,747.94.
 
Bulls have seemingly taken yesterday’s move to a multi-week low as an opportune moment to increase position sizes in ETH.
 
 
Like with BTC, this was helped by the fact that RSI found a stable point of support, which in the case of ethereum was at the 41.00 zone.
 
From the floor, price strength is now tracking close to a ceiling at 45.00, and should this be broken, ETH will possibly move back above a key point at $1,830.
