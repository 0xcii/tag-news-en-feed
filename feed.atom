IRS Temporarily Halts Enforcement of Digital Asset Reporting
 
The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have announced a temporary reprieve for businesses in reporting certain digital asset transactions. The latest guidance, outlined in Announcement 2024-4, comes as a relief to many in the digital currency space.
 
As reported earlier, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which recently revised the rules for taxpayers engaged in trade or business, had expanded the definition of cash to include digital assets. This meant businesses were required to report any receipt of digital asse…]]></summary>
