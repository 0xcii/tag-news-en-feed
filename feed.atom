Keanu Reeves Praises Crypto
 
Famous actor Keanu Reeves talked about cryptocurrency in an interview with Wired, published Tuesday. The Matrix and John Wick star opined:
 

I think the principle, the ideas behind an independent currency are amazing. These are amazing tools for exchanges and distribution of resources.
 
“So, to pooh-pooh crypto, or the volatility of cryptocurrency, it’s only going to make it better in terms of how it’s safeguarded,” he added without providing further details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last bull run, and even into this year, meme coins have shown themselves to be formidable contenders in the crypto market. The gains from these digital assets with seemingly no utility have created their own fair share of millionaires. Now, while these assets are riskier to invest in due to their much higher volatility, they still get a lot of attention from investors. So here are five meme coins to keep an eye on going into the next bull run.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) 
Dogecoin (DOGE) is the OG meme coin. Without DOGE, the whole idea of meme coins would not exist, and neither would they be seeing as many gains as they have. Dogecoin caught the eye of billionaire and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk who said it was his favorite cryptocurrency.

Terraform Labs once operated what was considered the dominant decentralized stablecoin UST – and was building a robust defi ecosystem before the cards collapsed in the first half of 2022. While Terraform Labs co-founder and CEO Do Kwon maintained his innocence on public platforms, crediting Terra’s downfall to that of a targeted attack on the network, the SEC will look to present a formidable challenge for Kwon and company to present their case – arguably for the first time yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new miners will contribute to CleanSpark’s ongoing expansion, just as the Bitcoin market ramps up.
CleanSpark Inc. has purchased 20,000 brand new Antminer S19j Pro+ units, the latest generation of Bitmain’s bitcoin mining machines, for $43.6 million. After coupons, the company will pay $32.3 million, according to the press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.
This purchase is expected to expand the company's bitcoin production capacity by 37%, adding 2.44 exahashes per second (EH/s) once installed. CleanSpark plans to deploy the fleet of new machines at its wholly-owned bitcoin mining locations in the USA with 15,000 of them planned for its Washington, Georgia, facility. There may be changes to that allocation, depending on the state of development of the site and the pace of order fulfillment by the manufacturer, the release states.
Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, said, "Building and owning our mining campuses at multiple locations provides us with a level of agility and reliability that cannot be achieved otherwise. As machines are delivered to us, we will have rackspace waiting for them at one of our sites. This is the advantage of proprietary mining or the 'prop mining' model. We exercise tremendous control over our infrastructure and, therefore, our ability to be highly efficient in the way we allocate our resources."
CleanSpark's capital management strategy includes selling a major portion of its mined bitcoins to reinvest in growth, manifesting in the form of these expansions. The Pro+ is more power-efficient and 22% more productive than the popular Antminer S19j Pro model and will be shipped in batches, with deliveries starting as early as next month. All batches are expected to be delivered to the company's mining campuses by the end of May 2023.]]></summary>

It doesn’t just stop and start with OpenSea, either: the once Solana-dedicated NFT marketplace Magic Eden has been branching out, including support for Polygon NFTs. While not cross-chain (at least, yet), Ethereum-dedicated no-fee platform Blur has launched it’s own Ethereum-based platform token, causing quite a stir this week.
 
And now Rarible, another major longtime NFT marketplace, is expanding to a more multi-chain future as well – announcing new tools of support for Tezos and Polygon NFTs this week.
