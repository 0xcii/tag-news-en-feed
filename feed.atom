Several applications have already been rejected by the SEC citing concerns over the nascent market being too risky for investors. However, the applications have gained momentum in recent months, with many now expecting a green light from the SEC.
 
Bitcoin Price Could Jump 500%
 
While speaking in an interview with CNBC, Fundstrat co-founder Tom Fundstrat shared his optimistic prediction regarding Bitcoin. According to the company’s head of research, spot ETFs could increase BTC’s demand in relation to its supply, pushing it to $150,000 or maybe even further by the end of next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu fell lower for a fifth straight session on Thursday, resulting in the meme coin dropping to a 13-day low. Since hitting a four-month high last Saturday, SHIB has struggled to find a firm floor. On the other hand, Solana ended a recent losing streak.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was a notable gainer on Thursday, as the meme coin moved lower for a fifth consecutive day.
 
SHIB/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.000008543 earlier in today’s session, following a peak of $0.000009854 the day prior.
 
This decline pushed SHIB to its lowest point since August 4, when price traded at a low of $0.00000827.
 
 
The latest drop comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell below a support point of 50.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.31, with a floor of 39.00 the next possible target.
 
In the event it reaches this target, SHIB will likely be trading below $0.000008000.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
On the other hand, solana (SOL) returned to the green during today’s session, snapping a two-day losing streak in the process.
 
Following a low of $22.49 on Wednesday, SOL/USD climbed to an intraday high of $23.58 earlier in the day.
 
The move comes as bullish pressure resurfaced, following a marginal breakout below a support point at $22.50.
 
 
This rebound comes following a recent upward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving average.
 
Despite this, there is still a high level of market uncertainty, as price strength hovers close to a key floor at 44.00.
 
Should it break out of this point, SOL could move below $22.00.

The crypto market has observed some significant volatility during the past day, as many assets including Bitcoin have taken a notable hit. This volatility in spot prices has also caused chaos in the futures market, where a mass amount of liquidations has piled up.
 
A contract is said to be “liquidated” when the derivative platform with which said contract is open forcibly closes it due to it amassing losses of a specific percentage (which may differ from exchange to exchange).

Soft currency is often used instead of soft money, they are interchangeable in the economic sense as they both refer to a currency that is not backed by a tangible commodity and whose value is based on government regulation and public confidence.
