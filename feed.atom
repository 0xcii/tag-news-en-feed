Average Bitcoin Trade Size Rising In U.S. Exchanges
 
According to Kaiko data on December 5, the average trade size on United States exchanges like Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Kraken has rapidly risen since September 2023. If this data guides, it indicates that institutions are making larger block trades, doubling down on Bitcoin. 
 
 
The increase in average trade size coincides with the expected approval of the first batch of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. In the coming weeks, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will rule on several Bitcoin ETF applica…]]></summary>

Daniel Batten, co-founder of CH4 Capital, has expressed concerns that the EC’s approach could lead to an EU mining ban and have far-reaching consequences for the global Bitcoin community. Batten argues that the proposed metrics are “unscientific” and ignore the positive environmental externalities of Bitcoin. 
 
Methodology For Bitcoin Environmental Impact Questioned
 
According to Daniel Batten, the EC’s proposed methodology includes measuring crypto-assets resource consumption “per transaction” and relying on reports financially backed by Central Banks and other entities to evaluate Bitcoin’s environmental impact.

At the core of these insights, Hayden Adams spotlighted Uniswap as a key contributor to ETH’s value. His analysis suggests that Uniswap “dominates” ETH’s blockspace usage, accounting for a significant portion of the network’s maximum extractable value (MEV).
 
 
According to the founder of Uniswap, this dominance underscores the practical applications being developed on Ethereum, driving its utility and value. Concurrently, Ryan Sean Adams emphasizes Ethereum’s unique position as a “profitable blockchain.”

Earlier in November, Farina predicted that the price of XRP could soar to $10,000 if the Ripple Network takes over SWIFT, a global messaging network used by banks. Farina’s forecast hinges on Ripple’s value as a global payments network that offers faster, inexpensive, and more scalable services than Bitcoin.
