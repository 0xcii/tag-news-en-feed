        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last May, I wrote an article for Bitcoin Magazine predicting that Layer 2 (L2) metaprotocol solutions would resolve the Ordinals controversy. Now that two of the most highly-anticipated Layer 2 solutions, Taproot Assets (TA) and RGB, are either available or imminent, it’s time to revisit this subject. Indeed, it may be past time judging by recent fee spikes driven by a resurgence of interest in BRC-20 tokens...
Following my view that the price, fee, and flexibility advantages offered by L2 metaprotocol solutions over on-chain Ordinals will ultimately prove decisive, I’ve focused my energies on advancing such solutions. Over the last few months, I’ve been deeply involved in both TA and RGB projects. In early September, I established a group in which the developers of L2 metaprotocol wallets…]]></summary>

Altcoins May Be Overbought Currently As Trader Profits Have Shot Up
 
In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed how the altcoins as a whole have been observing high profits recently based on the MVRV ratio.
 
The “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio” is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the market cap and realized cap for any given cryptocurrency.
 
The “realized cap” here refers to a capitalization model that assumes the real value of any token in circulation is not the current spot price of the asset, but rather the value at which it was last moved on the blockchain.

Snowden’s Response About Him Being Bitcoin Creator
 
Snowden didn’t categorically affirm or deny whether he was Satoshi while responding to this speculation about him being the Bitcoin founder. However, he stated that if he ever claims to be Satoshi, everyone should “look hard” at his posts to figure out whether he is “just trolling or if age has finally robbed” him of his faculties. 
 
 
He further stated that if it is neither of those, then he is definitely using his claim about being Satoshi as a duress code. Althoug…]]></summary>
