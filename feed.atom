        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About 52 virtual currency operators have shown interest in joining Taiwan’s financial market, the Financial Supervisory Commission has said. The commission also said that it is planning to announce the region’s first virtual asset management guiding principles sometime in September.
 
Virtual Asset-Specific Laws
 
Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) recently revealed that some 52 virtual currency operators have expressed interest in joining the Taiwanese financial market. According to the regulator, some of these operators have processed the legal documents on money laundering prevention while others have yet to complete this step.
 
As explained in one local report, the FSC made these revelations during a public hearing conducted by a local legislator Guo Guow. In addition, the regulator also revealed that it is planning to announce sometime in September the first virtual asset management guiding principles.
 
The report also suggested that authorities in the region have however not ruled out setting up laws specific to virtual assets. Yet, before such laws are enacted, virtual assets will reportedly be regulated under the Money Laundering Prevention Act. As per the report, operators that fail to abide by the anti-money laundering laws face fines that range between $69,000 and $1.38 million.
 
 
However, the report said under the current guidelines, aggrieved virtual asset investors cannot lodge complaints against operators with the Financial Review Center. Nevertheless, the FSC said it will still attempt to protect virtual asset users via other methods at its disposal. Some of these methods include asking operators to separate their assets from users’ funds.
 
Meanwhile, Huang Houming, deputy director of the Securities and Futures Bureau, said after the guiding principles are released later this month, operators will be encouraged to establish associations and self-regulate.

As Bitcoinist reported, Visa announced last week that they are expanding their stablecoin pilot to Solana. The global payments behemoth’s decision comes on the heels of its ongoing efforts to modernize cross-border money transfers by harnessing the power of blockchain technology.
 
Why Visa Chose Solana
 
Visa’s exploration, penned by Mustafa Bedawala and Arjuna Wijeyekoon, underscores Solana’s impressive transaction throughput. Although the blockchain has not yet matched Visa’s staggering capacity of 65,000 transactions per second, it boasts an average of 400 user-generated transactions per second.

Flatcoins, stable currencies that change their value according to the inflation in a determined jurisdiction, have surged as a crypto-based solution for the issue.
 
Flatcoins and Their Proposal
 
The problem of rising inflation has gained notoriety this year as large world economies that had traditionally kept prices relatively under control were affected by a loss of purchasing power. For example, U.S. inflation touched 9.1% during 2022, reaching one of its highest levels since 1981.
 
This rise prompted a swift response from the Federal Reserve, which started hiking interest rates to address inflation. However, …]]></summary>

Gensler will emphasize, “There is nothing about the crypto asset securities markets that suggests that investors and issuers are less deserving of the protections of our securities laws.” He further elaborated on the historical context, noting that Congress, in its 1933 and 1934 securities laws, did not limit the definition of securities to just stocks and bonds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The decentralized crypto exchange Sushi is expanding to the Aptos blockchain. The team noted that the move marks Sushi’s first expansion onto a non-EVM blockchain.
 
From Ethereum to Aptos
 
Sushi is a decentralized exchange (dex) and automated market maker (AMM) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade crypto assets and provide liquidity in return for rewards. Launched on August 28, 2020, The dex also has a native governance token called SUSHI.
 
“By leveraging Aptos’s Move programming language, Sushi is initially introducing its v2 Automated Market Maker (AMM), with more integrations to come,” Sushi said in its announcement. The Sushi team believes the Aptos integration will unlock deeper cross-chain liquidity and elevate the trading experience across chains.
 
Aptos is a new layer one (L1) blockchain focused on scalability and claims to provide reliability, security, and usability. Its Move programming language enables developers to build Web3 applications in a different fashion. As a non-EVM chain, Aptos represents new territory for Sushi, the developers remarked.
 
 
According to the announcement, “This expansion to Aptos not only unlocks a new level of deep liquidity across major blockchain networks but also significantly elevates the cross-chain trading experience.” Sushi’s team insists the decision will strengthen its leading cross-chain position by spreading to Aptos.
 
Sushi was once a top dex but volume has dropped considerably over the past few years. Defillama.com statistics show that the dex platform has $347.23 million total value locked across various protocols. Sushi’s TVL has also lost a great deal of value since November 2021, after holding more than $8 billion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase Cloud and blockchain infrastructure company Kiln are now allowing ethereum (ETH) users to stake any amount of ether natively. The new offering removes the previous 32 ETH minimum staking requirement.
 
Staking for All: Coinbase Cloud and Kiln Break Down Minimum Barriers
 
With the integration of Kiln’s onchain staking platform, Coinbase Cloud and its clients can enable partial ETH staking. This allows wallet providers like Coinbase Wallet to give users the ability to earn staking rewards without needing to meet minimums. The press announcement notes that over 99 percent of ether wallets hold less than the 32 ETH previously required to stake on the network.
 
“We are thrilled to have worked with Coinbase Cloud and to welcome them as the first (non-Kiln) node operator leveraging the Kiln Onchain Staking Platform,” said Kiln CEO Laszlo Szabo. The Kiln CEO added:
 
 
This integration with Coinbase Cloud is unique because it allows them to enable other wallets and services, including [decentralized exchanges], with the same limitless [ether] staking solution that will be offered by Coinbase Wallet.
 
 
 
Partial ETH staking builds on Coinbase Cloud’s existing staking infrastructure. The company said its multi-cloud, multi-region setup ensures reliability alongside trusted security standards. Coinbase further discloses that staking operations occur transparently onchain through audited smart contracts.
 
Coinbase posits that by removing staking minimums, more individual users can participate in securing the Ethereum network while earning rewards. The move comes as staked ETH ratios continue rising after Ethereum’s recent upgrade. Coinbase Cloud is currently offering this new open staking access starting with integration in Coinbase Wallet.
