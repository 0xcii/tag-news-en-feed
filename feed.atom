        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency, Tether (USDT), recently lost its $1 peg. Here are some facts that on-chain data reveals about this event.
 
Several On-Chain Indicators Spiked While Tether Suffered A Depeg
 
In the past couple of days, USDT became decoupled from its $1 peg as the stablecoin’s value plunged to $0.996. Since then, however, the asset has seen some recovery, although the $1 peg is yet to be regained as Tether still trends under $0.999.
 
While this isn’t the first time that the largest stablecoin by market cap has observed destabilization, it’s natural that this depegging event has still led to the emergence of fresh FUD in the market.
 
In a new post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has looked at how this USDT drop has reflected on the on-chain side of thin…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-shib-remains-close-to-21-month-low-following-recent-bear-run/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-16T15:40:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite a slight rebound in price, shiba inu remained near its lowest level in 21 months during Friday’s session. Overall, the global cryptocurrency market cap was marginally higher, climbing by 1% as of writing. XRP was an exception, dropping to a three-week low today.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) moved away from its lowest point in almost two years, as crypto bulls swept in to buy the recent dip in price.
 
Following a bottom of $0.00000653 on Thursday, SHIB/USD rose to a high of $0.00000682 earlier in the day.
 
This rally resulted in the meme coin moving away from last Saturday’s bottom at $0.00000600, which is the weakest point price has hit since September 2021.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the sell-off has eased, which came as SHIB began consolidating around a key support point of $0.00000635.
 
Overall, sentiment in the meme coin remains significantly bearish, with price strength tracking below the 30.00 level.
 
At the time of writing, the relative strength index (RSI) is tracking at 25.62, after bouncing from a recent floor at 21.00.
 
 
XRP
 
On the other hand, XRP, formerly ripple, extended a recent downtrend, with the token falling to a fresh multi-week low.
 
XRP/USD plunged to an intraday low of $0.4601 on Friday, a day after trading at a peak of $0.4833.
 
As a result of this decline, XRP fell by nearly 4% in today’s session, dropping to its lowest point since May 26 in the process.
 
 
In the last seven days the token has lost nearly 14% of its value, which comes after the price rose to a ten-week high on Tuesday.
 
Initially, it appears that bulls were likely capturing profits and liquidating their positions, however sentiment shifted, with bears using this as an opportunity to reenter the market.
 
Should this current trend continue, there is a good chance that XRP will hit a floor of $0.4200 in the near future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Founder and CEO of crypto brokerage firm Prometheum Aaron Kaplan’s support for the SEC in a recent Daily Drop episode stirred the Ripple community’s reaction. In the interview, Kaplan said the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission would win in the Ripple lawsuit.
 
He likened the ongoing Ripple lawsuit to the SEC’s legal battle against LBRY Credits, noting that the judge ruled in the commission’s favor. 
 
Kaplan’s View On Ripple Lawsuit
 
The SEC filed a suit against the content distribution decentralized blockchain platform LBRY Credits in March 2021. The regulator alleged that LBRY violated securities law by offering unregistered LBC tokens.
 
 
However, the SEC won the lawsuit after the judge ruled in the agency’s favor. And Prometheum founder Kaplan argued that the SEC law…]]></summary>

These allegations against Binance stem from two main charges. First, the company is accused of operating as a digital asset service provider unlawfully. Second, it faces more severe accusations of ‘aggravated money laundering.’ 
 
This includes competition with investments, concealment, and conversion, with the latter performed by offenders who have generated profits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance, the crypto exchange with the highest trade volume globally, is currently facing an investigation for suspected money laundering activities, as reported by the French publication Le Monde. The finance judicial investigation service of France is currently scrutinizing the actions of Binance’s subsidiary in the country.
 
French Regulators Probe Binance
 
Amid mounting challenges faced by the crypto exchange Binance, recent developments reveal that French authorities have turned their attention to the exchange’s French subsidiary. Following the legal action taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance, reports indicate that law enforcement officials in France have initiated an investigation into the matter. The French publication Le Monde has verified this information with the Paris public prosecutor’s office.
 
The complaint against Binance contains accusations of “aggravated money laundering” and charges related to the “illegal provision of services for digital assets (PSAN).” It is alleged that Binance neglected to establish a proper know-your-customer (KYC) compliance process within the country. However, a spokesperson from Binance, in correspondence with Reuters, disclosed that the exchange engaged in a meeting with regulators just last week.
 
 
“In France, on-site visits by regulators and inspectors are part of regulatory obligations to which all financial institutions must adhere. We had an on-site visit last week by the relevant authorities,” the Binance representative said. “We will not comment on the specifics of law enforcement or regulatory investigations except to say that information about our users is held securely and only provided to government officials upon receipt of documented appropriate justification.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose back above $25,000 on Friday, as markets continued to digest recent U.S. economic data. Yesterday saw retail sales climb higher than expected, rising by 0.3% in May, better than a projected decline of 0.1%. Ethereum moved closer to the $1,700 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin bulls made a brief appearance during Friday’s session, pushing the price back above $25,000 in the process.
 
Following a low of $24,797.17 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $25,735.31 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed above a recent ceiling at the $25,500 mark.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 

 
Despite today’s $1,000 jump in price, the relative strength index (RSI) still remains below a resistance of its own at 42.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.00, which could act as a major hurdle to further upwards momentum.
 
It will be interesting to see how traders behave over the coming weekend, with the chance to buy this week’s dip still present.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) made relative gains in today’s session, as the cryptocurrency moved back towards the $1,700 level.
 
ETH/USD reached a high of $1,676.41 on Friday, less than 24 hours after nearing a breakout below $1,600.
 
The rebound in ethereum comes as the RSI moved away from a recent three-month low of 30.74, which was in oversold territory.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Similar to BTC above, price strength has since climbed, and is currently at a reading of 33.39, which is still bearish.
 
Traders will likely look to March, which is the last time the index tracked at this mark, shortly before prices went on to climb over $500 higher.
