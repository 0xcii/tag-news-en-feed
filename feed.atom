        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ethereum price performance has been a major source of concern for investors over the past few weeks, persisting in a downward trend. What makes the token’s struggles even more worrying is that it has not shown any signs of relief despite the recent launch of spot ETH ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in the United States.
 
However, it appears that the underwhelming performance of the ETH ETFs — so far — might even be contributing to the Ethereum price troubles in recent weeks. Specifically, Grayscale has been seeing a significant flow of capital out of its Ether fund, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

This grassroots initiative fits with the recent Bitcoin Act proposal by Senator Cynthia Lummis, which seeks to create a distributed network of safe Bitcoin vaults run by the US Treasury.
 
 
Using current Treasury money, the project suggests that the US government purchase one million Bitcoin, or roughly five percent of the whole quantity. Proponents contend that this strategic reserve might be a key instrument for lowering national debt and fighting inflation, thereby establishing the US as a leader in financial creativity.
