Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Continues To Point At Neutral Sentiment
 
The “fear and greed index” is a metric that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market.

Ethereum Open Interest Has Shot Up Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the ETH open interest has spiked as the cryptocurrency’s price has been declining, a pattern that has also been seen a few times in the past month.
 
The “open interest” here is an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of Ethereum futures market contracts that are currently open on all derivative exchanges. This metric naturally counts both long and short contracts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BitGo, a leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency custody firm, announced on Wednesday that it has successfully raised $100 million in its Series C financing round, bolstering its valuation to $1.75 billion. The funds will be allocated to amplify BitGo's secure and regulated custody, wallet, and infrastructure solutions on a global scale and to facilitate strategic acquisitions.



"Not only are we seeing growing demand for regulated custody solutions in the US, but we're also seeing the demand on a global scale," said BitGo CEO Mike Belshe. "We are very pleased to announce our $100M Series C for the purpose of meeting this growing need and to provide institutions, brands, coin foundations, and others with secure and seamless participation in the digital asset ecosystem."
Amid a dynamic market environment, BitGo has registered growth across the board since the beginning of the year. With a 60% surge in new client onboarding, a 20% increase in Asset Under Custody (AUC), a 200% upswing in fiat custody, and a 40-fold growth in staked assets. Notably, BitGo has distinguished itself as the entrusted custodian for the FTX creditors' funds under the leadership of John Ray III. Previously, the company was also selected as the distributor for the Mt. Gox creditors.
BitGo's recent funding success comes on the heels of the launch of its Go Network, empowering institutions to trade and settle both digital assets and fiat currencies round the clock from secure custody. With a robust presence as a premier regulated custodian in more than 50 countries, BitGo consistently handles an 20% of all on-chain Bitcoin transactions by value, according to the announcement.
Big name clients, such as Nike, have also chosen BitGo's secure and scalable wallet-as-a-service solution to navigate the intricate regulatory landscape.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The digital asset trust firm Bitgo, headquartered in Palo Alto, California, has secured $100 million in a Series C funding round. While the company remains tight-lipped about the participants in this financial endeavor, this fresh infusion of capital catapults the firm’s post-valuation to $1.75 billion.
 
Bitgo Raises $100 Million From Undisclosed Investors
 
Bitgo has successfully bagged $100 million in a Series C funding round, with the investors’ names under wraps, as per a Bloomberg report. Bitgo’s top executive, Mike Belshe, acknowledged the challenging market landscape. Yet, he emphasized the company’s commitment to licensing and regulatory measures, noting, “Regulatory safety is top-of-mind for everyone,” in a conversation with Bloomberg’s Hannah Miller.
 
This update comes on the heels of Galaxy Digital scrapping its intentions to snap up Bitgo for a cool $1.2 billion in August 2022. Earlier, in June, Bitgo had its eyes on the beleaguered crypto custodian, Prime Trust, with acquisition plans. However, the deal fell through. Prime Trust soon found itself filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the following month.
 
 
Though the Prime Trust deal went south, Belshe indicated to Miller that a portion of this fresh capital would fuel future acquisitions. He alluded to two potential buyouts already in the pipeline, as cited by Miller. While Bitgo remains mum on this round’s backers, past investors have featured big names like Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, Redpoint, Goldman Sachs, and DRW Holdings.
