However, there may finally be an end in sight for users who have their funds stuck on the platform as it looks like Celsius is getting ready for fund distribution.
 
Celsius Network Asks Investors To Update Information
 
In an email that was sent out on Thursday, August 24, Celsius Network has requested that users update their Know Your Customer (KYC) information on the app. The reason for this, the company said, was to prepare for when the court approved the distribution of the assets that it has been able to recover in the course of its bankruptcy proceedings in the last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the newest episode of Bitcoin Magazine’s "Bitcoin, Explained,” hosts Aaron van Wirdum and Sjors Provoost discuss the ramifications of a newly discovered exploit dubbed “Milk Sad,” affecting Bitcoin users attempting to run the alternative Bitcoin implementation Libbitcoin when connecting to the network.
Revealed earlier this month, the issue of an insecure Bitcoin command called "BX Seed" in the Libitcoin library has made it vulnerable to attacks, potentially allowing adversaries to guess private keys and access Bitcoin funds.

As profiled, the insecure command produces only 32-bit random seeds, significantly reducing the number of possible seeds and making it relatively easy to guess a target user’s private keys.
The podcast delves into the history of the implementation, as well as other alternatives to the most widely used Bitcoin software, Bitcoin Core. The episode also touches on the responsibility of Bitcoin developers to ensure the security of their code, especially if that code is referenced in widely read resources like books or online tutorials. In this particular case, the BX seed exploit was referenced in Andreas Antonopoulous’ widely read “Mastering Bitcoin.” 
The hosts suggest that clear warnings should be provided in documentation to indicate that certain commands are unsafe for production use.
Ultimately, the podcast underscores the importance of secure coding practices, thorough testing, and proper communication to prevent vulnerabilities that could potentially lead to financial losses and security breaches in the cryptocurrency space.]]></summary>
