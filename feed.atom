However, there is still space for banking in a Bitcoin world; though a variation from the system with which we are currently familiar. 
Caitlin Long has tirelessly fought for sound banking practices especially as it relates to the dangers of leverage in bitcoin. Her work has brought positive attention to what banking in the Bitcoin space should look like.

In the wake of lawsuits being launched by the SEC against massive exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, a former SEC official has warned of regulatory “siege” against crypto platforms, a judge has blocked efforts by the regulator to freeze Binance US’ assets, and economist Peter Schiff has said the Fed destroyed the U.S. banking system. This and more, just below, in the Bitcoin.com News Week in Review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New York-based digital assets platform Bakkt has decided to delist three prominent cryptocurrencies—Solana, Cardano, and Polygon—due to regulatory uncertainty and a lack of clarity. This move follows recent lawsuits filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against leading crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance, alleging the sale of unregistered securities, including Solana, Cardano, and Polygon.
 
The SEC’s legal actions marked the first time these three cryptocurrencies were specifically identified as securities. While SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has consistently asserted that most cryptocurrencies, except for Bitcoin, fall under the securities category, this regulatory development has prompted Bakkt and other crypto platforms to reassess their token listings.

While some may assume that this ETF will resemble the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), there are notable distinctions between the two products.
 
BlackRock’s iShares Trust Vs. GBTC
 
BlackRock’s iShares product, technically classified as a trust, offers redemptions similar to an ETF, unlike GBTC.
 
Noelle Acheson clarifies that the market may mistakenly associate “trust” with GBTC’s lack of redemption options, but this is not true for BlackRock’s offering.
 

 
 
The key disparity between a BTC ETF and a trust lies in the ETF’s ability to purchase bitcoin at the end of the trading day to align the fund’s assets with its trading price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana climbed for a third consecutive session, as crypto markets rebounded to start the weekend. At the time of writing, the global market cap rose by 3.3%, as bullish sentiment returned. Polygon was another notable gainer, surging by over 5% on Saturday.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) raced to a one-week high on Saturday, as crypto prices rallied following a recent spell of downward sentiment.
 
After falling to a low of $14.47 during yesterday’s session, SOL/USD bounced to a peak of $16.07 to start the weekend.
 
The move came as the token continued to distance itself from a recent support point at the $14.00 mark.
 
 
From the chart, it seems that the latest rise in price has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) to a resistance zone at 36.00.
 
This has led to earlier bulls abandoning their positions, leading to the index now tracking at 35.77.
 
In the event this hurdle is overcome, there is a good chance that SOL will move towards $17.00.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Additionally, polygon (MATIC) also made sizeable gains on Saturday, climbing by as much as 6% today.
 
MATIC/USD jumped to an intraday high of $0.6302 to start the weekend, a day after falling to a low of $0.5624.
 
As a result of the surge, polygon once again rose past a floor at $0.5760 and seems set to collide with a ceiling at $0.6700.
 
 
Despite today’s gains, MATIC still remains oversold, with price strength tracking at the 29.12 level.
 
This is however a positive for bulls, as there is still substantial upside to entering at this current level.
 
There is still a degree of uncertainty also, as a resistance point at 31.00 will likely test the strength of buyers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin bounced back strongly to start the weekend, as prices moved closer to the $27,000 mark in today’s session. After a recent spell of consolidation, bulls returned to action, buying the recent dip in the process. Ethereum was also higher, closing in on $1,800 on Saturday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) surged on Saturday, as bulls of the cryptocurrency moved to buy the recent dip in price.
 
BTC/USD rose to a high of $26,769.39 to start the weekend, which comes less than a day after trading at a low of $25,245.36.
 
The move pushed the price to its highest point since May 8, a day when the price was at a peak of $26,820.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally came when the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) finally broke out of a key ceiling at 43.00.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is tracking at 50.55, which is close to a new resistance at the 51.00 level.
 
Traders are likely targeting the $27,300 level, and could hit this if momentum continues to be bullish this weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also rebounded strongly to start the weekend, days after falling to a three-month low.
 
Following a low of $1,653.17 on Friday, ETH/USD raced to an intraday peak at the $1,766.76 level earlier today.
 
ETH fell to a bottom at $1,620 on Thursday, which was the weakest point that the price had hit since March 13.
 
 
Similar to BTC, a breakout of the RSI was one of the triggers of the move, with price strength climbing past a ceiling at 41.00.
 
The index is currently at a reading of 43.79, with the next resistance level at the 50.00 mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tether, one of the largest stablecoin providers, has recently issued a comprehensive rebuttal to address growing concerns surrounding the inclusion of securities issued by Chinese companies in the reserves of USDT. 
 
In response to reports published by mainstream media outlets, including Bloomberg, the company has sought to clarify its stance on the matter.
 
 
These reports, citing documents released by New York’s Attorney General (NYAG), brought attention to the previous backing of USDT by securities from prominent Chinese state-owned firms, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China. 
 
Tether’s detailed response aims to shed light on the situation, offering a deeper understanding of the company’s practices and the rat…]]></summary>
