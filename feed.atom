The on-chain indicator of interest here is the “Puell Multiple,” which keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin miner revenue and the 365-day MA of the same.
 
 
The miners earn their income through two sources, block reward and transaction fee, but in the context of the Puell Multiple, only the block reward, which happens to make up for the majority of the mining revenue, is relevant.
