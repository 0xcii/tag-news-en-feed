49% Of Bitcoin In Long-Term Holdings
 
According to data from analytics firm Glassnode, 49% of the total Bitcoin supply has stayed in the same wallet for more than two years. This is equivalent to more than 9.45 million Bitcoins or about $220 billion at the time of writing.
 
Glassnode further explained this trend with a graph that shows the previous peak came in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021. The peak ended during the bull market of 2021 because holders began selling as the price of BTC went up.

Recent price increases for Shiba Inus are primarily attributable to a tremendous increase in burn rate. In the first month of 2023, around 1.12 billion tokens were disposed of through SHIB’s burn gateway.
 

 
Experts speculate that the recent announcement by Canadian crypto payment gateway FCF Pay that it will support the three primary tokens of the Shiba Inu ecosystem (SHIB, LEASH, and BONE) on its prepaid Visa and Mastercard cards is also contributing to the rise of SHIB.

The discourse of a British CBDC began in April 2021, when the UK Treasury, then under the leadership of current UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, launched a joint task force with the BoE to evaluate the feasibility of a “digital pound” for British businesses and households.
 
Since then, there have been multiple discussions and reports as both financial authorities weighed the potential benefits and risks a “digital pound” could bring to the UK economy. After 21 months of research and consultations, it would appear both parties have eventually come to a decision.
