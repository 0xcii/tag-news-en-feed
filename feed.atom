Ethereum Daily Active Addresses Have Seen A Surge Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the ETH active addresses are currently at their second-highest level since the middle of September. The “active addresses” here refer to those addresses on the Ethereum blockchain that are taking part in some sort of transaction activity.
 
In the context of the current discussion, the unique number of these active addresses is of interest. Note that this metric takes into account both the senders and receivers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent legal move, Digital Currency Group’s (DCG) subsidiary Genesis Global Capital LLC has filed a complaint against the crypto exchange platform and custodian Gemini. Genesis hopes to claw back $689 million from the centralized crypto trading platform founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in 2014. 
 
Genesis Targets Gemini in $689M Legal Battle Over Alleged Preferential Crypto Withdrawals
 
The court filing, filed on November 21, 2023, accuses Gemini of withdrawing over $689 million in the months leading to Genesis’ Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. This action, according to Genesis, unfairly benefited Gemini at the expense of other creditors.
 
The complaint, filed in the wake of significant crypto market instability that began in 2022, targets transactions occurring in the 90 days preceding Genesis’ bankruptcy declaration. According to the document, Gemini’s withdrawals totaled approximately $689.30 million, a move Genesis describes as preferential and detrimental to the broader creditor base.
 
This situation arose during a period marked by notable fluctuations and uncertainty within the cryptocurrency sector, further complicating the financial dynamics at play. Genesis’ legal strategy aims to invoke the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code to rectify what it perceives as an inequitable situation.
 
 
By doing so, they intend to recover the withdrawn funds in a clawback, thereby restoring a level playing field among all of Genesis’ creditors. The lawyers insist the focus is not just on the monetary aspect but also on the principles of fairness and equitable treatment in bankruptcy proceedings.
 
The complaint details the significant withdrawals by Gemini, characterizing them as preferential transfers. These actions, as per the filing, allowed Gemini to allegedly gain an advantage over other creditors, an advantage that Genesis seeks to nullify.

It is something that every Bitcoiner intellectually wrestles with on their journey down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. It is a frequently cited reason by those skeptical of Bitcoin to justify their reluctance to explore further education. Thankfully many excellent writers have written extensively debunking this piece of FUD. Bitcoiners often emphasize the logistical challenges, intense resource costs, game-theoretical complexities, and the sheer implausibility of any attempt by the State to outlaw Bitcoin. While Bitcoiners hail these writings as compelling evidence of the inevitable advent of hyperbitcoinization, the subsequent logical question is frequently unexamined or hastily dismissed: If the governme…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-22T15:11:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Numerous sources have reported that the Heco Bridge, a cross-chain conduit linking Ethereum with the Heco blockchain, has suffered a security breach, resulting in a loss of $86 million. Subsequent to the heist, the stolen funds were redirected to various decentralized exchange (dex) platforms.
 
Major $86 Million Theft Hits Heco Bridge
 
In a recent setback for a venture linked to Tron’s creator, Justin Sun, it’s estimated that $85 to $86 million has been drained from the Heco Bridge. Blockchain security firms Cyvers and Peckshield raised the alarm about this breach, stating, “Our initial analysis indicates the suspicious $86.6m outflow from Heco Chain bridge was from a compromised operator, which was operational since [October 8, 2022].”
 
In a strategic move in 2022, Sun combined HTX’s Heco Chain with the Tron and Bittorrent blockchains, aiming to foster a more integrated platform and promote cooperation between developers from Heco, Tron, and Bittorrent. Recently, Sun’s ventures have been recurrent targets of significant cyber attacks, including the HTX (formerly Huobi) hack, the Poloniex breach, and the latest Heco Chain incident.
 
 
Currently, the perpetrator’s wallet holds 30,949 ether, valued at $62.83 million, which is only a portion of the total stolen amount. As of 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on November 22, 2023, there has been no update from Heco Chain’s X account regarding the situation. However, Sun has addressed the issue on social media, revealing that HTX is preparing to compensate for the lost funds.
 
“HTX will fully compensate for HTX’s hot wallet Losses,” Sun wrote. “Deposits and withdrawals [are] temporarily suspended. All funds in HTX are secure, and the community can rest assured. We are investigating the specific reasons for the hacker attack. Once we complete the investigation and identify the cause, we will resume services.”

Crypto Tokens Are Not Securities
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Alderoty questioned the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance on crypto tokens. He noted that neither did the DOJ mention anything about Binance violating securities laws or that the crypto tokens on the exchange were securities in the charges it brought against the foremost crypto exchange in the world. 
 
 
As he rightly mentioned, the DOJ didn’t make any statement to suggest that crypto tokens were securities in line with the view that the SEC already holds. This is despite the fact …]]></summary>

This move triggered a crash in the price of BNB, the native token of the exchange.
