        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia is joining the global spot ETF frenzy courtesy of Monochrome’s Ethereum ETF (IETH). Monochrome’s announcement comes two months after the company launched its Bitcoin ETF (IBTC), which boasts a US$10.1 million investment since August last year.
 
The product’s success primarily influenced the company’s foray into the spot ETF market in the United States.
 
 
A few months after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the spot Bitcoin ETFs, the agency also had the green light on Ether’s ETF, paving the way for broader institutional participation.

Titled “Possible futures of the Ethereum protocol, part 1: The Merge,” the post delves into strategies to improve stability, performance, and accessibility while addressing centralization risks.
 
First, Buterin reflects on Ethereum’s successful transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake aka “The Merge” nearly two years ago, noting that “this proof of stake has performed remarkably well in stability, performance and avoiding centralization risks.” However, he emphasized that “there still remain some important areas in which proof of stake needs to improve.”
