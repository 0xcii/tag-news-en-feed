cryptocurrency mining has depended on the power-hungry Proof-of-Work (PoW)  
consensus process. Alternative mining techniques, on the other hand, that offer

attracted more attention. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Authority (PoA) are  
two well-known alternatives that are gaining popularity. 
The potential  
for various mining options to disrupt the bitcoin ecosystem is examined in this  
article along with their distinctive features. Readers can get comprehension of  
the advantages and factors of PoS and PoA and learn more about the developing  
field of bitcoin mining.

 The case being presented against Binance and its CEO details thirteen offenses, including that they “subverted their own controls to secretly allow high-value US customers to continue trading.” Regarding Binance's US trading arms, it's contended that they were offering unregistered securities, that their separation from the main business was essentially just a front, and that they were “operated as a fraud or deceit.” There are other claims that customer deposits were mismanaged, and it was stated that Changpeng Zhao operates a …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded from a near three-month low on Wednesday, as traders moved to buy the latest price dip. Yesterday’s decline came as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued both Binance and Coinbase. Ethereum moved closer to $1,900 in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) bounced back above the $27,000 level on Wednesday, as traders moved to buy the recent dip in price.
 
Following a low of $25,434.87 on Tuesday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $27,332.18 in today’s session.
 
This move saw bitcoin climb away from its weakest point since March 17, when it was at a low of $24,946.

Overall, price has also risen back above a key support point at $26,300, with the relative strength index (RSI) hovering near a similar area.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 45.67, which is below a resistance level of 47.00.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average also remains above its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could be a positive sign for longer-term bulls.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also made strong gains in today’s session, with prices closing in on a reentry above the $1,900 level.
 
ETH/USD hit a peak of $1,896.22 on Wednesday, which comes less than 24 hours after the price was below $1,800.
 
Tuesday’s decline sent ethereum to its weakest point since May 25, which was the last time the cryptocurrency was at a floor at $1,790.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that today’s rebound came as the RSI bounced from its own floor at 44.00.
 
The index is now tracking at 51.16, with the next visible point of resistance being at the 53.00 mark.
