The extension is expected to last for approximately three months, providing the crypto lender with additional time to address any outstanding financial obligations and potentially avoid insolvency.
 
During the period of the extension, the crypto firm plans to bring into place a restructuring plan via a new decentralized finance project named Hope. This initiative will allow the firm to explore new opportunities for growth and sustainability within the crypto lending market.

In the retail trading industry, many were curious about the nuts and bolts of the deal, which can be meaningful for pretty much every major broker and provider. The terms were famously not disclosed, but Finance Magnates sat down with eToro's UK Managing Director Dan Moczulski, to get a glimpse into its facets.   
Asked whether any user data could be shared between the two platforms, Mr Moczulski stated, “No, nothing. It’s a marketing deal at the moment.”
 And, on the subject of KYC checks, he explained: “What's not happening is, you click on Twitter, on $APPL, and suddenly, if you're not an eToro user, you get the ability to buy or sell Apple.

About 77% Of The Total Bitcoin Supply Is Now In Profit
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, a total of 6.2 million BTC has come back into the green this year. The relevant indicator here is the “percent supply in profit,” which tells us what percentage of the Bitcoin supply is currently carrying some amount of unrealized profit.
 
The metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in the circulating supply and checking what price it was last moved at. If this previous price for any coin was less than the current BTC value, then that specific coin is carrying a profit right now, and the indicator adds it to its value.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum moved back above $2,100 on Tuesday, as markets reacted to the latest gross domestic product (GDP) report from China. Chinese GDP rose by 4.5% during the first quarter of the year, higher than the 4% expected. Bitcoin rebounded from earlier losses.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded from a one-week low on Tuesday, as markets reacted to the latest gross domestic product (GDP) report from China.
 
BTC/USD dropped to a low of $29,154.85 earlier in today’s session, before climbing to a peak of $29,944.78 as the day matured.
 
The low sent bitcoin to its lowest point since April 10, which is when price was last below $29,000.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rebound has come as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a floor of 59.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at the 61.91 mark, with the next visible ceiling at the 65.00 level.
 
BTC will likely be trading above $30,200 should the RSI reach this upcoming destination.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was back above the $2,100 level in today’s session, as the token remains near an eleven-month high.
 
Following a low of $2,057.65 to start the week, ETH/USD raced to an intraday high of $2,109.58 earlier in the day.
 
Today’s peak is marginally lower than Sunday’s high of $2,142, which is the strongest point that ethereum has hit since last May.
 
 
Similar to bitcoin, this rebound took place as the RSI jumped from its own support point at 68.00.
 
As of writing, the index is now at the 70.24 mark, with a resistance point at 75.00 a possible destination.
 
Should it hit the mark, there is a good chance that ethereum could move over $2,200.
