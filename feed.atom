These regulations would require brokers (individuals facilitating buying and selling) to report digital currency transactions to the government, aligning with existing practices for other monetary transactions. 
 
However, these rules are facing opposition within the cryptocurrency community. Critics argue that these stringent measures could stifle innovation and progress within the US.
 
 
Ryan Selkis, CEO of Messari, is a vocal opponent of this concept. He predicts unfavorable outcomes for the US cryptocurrency industry if Biden is reelected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[India’s oil and gas minister says de-dollarization is a long way away. The official emphasized his desire to conduct all transactions in rupees, expressing his wish for the Indian currency to become “the lead currency in the world.”
 
Indian Official on De-Dollarization
 
India’s Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri stated in an interview with CNBC on the sidelines of the B20 Summit in New Delhi on Friday that de-dollarization is a long way off.
 
Puri explained that he expects the U.S. dollar to maintain its dominance in global trade. Commenting on factors that could dethrone the USD as the world’s reserve currency, he opined:
 

I don’t know what kind of change [the dollar needs to] be affected but I don’t see it … It’s not so easy.
 
The minister further shared that he does not see the Indian rupee challenging the U.S. dollar as a major global currency, even though it is being used in some oil transactions alongside the Chinese yuan and the Russian ruble. Nonetheless, he stressed:
 

I would like to be able to transact everything in rupees … I wish the Indian rupee should be the lead currency in the world. But I’m also a realist.
 
 
A growing number of countries are moving away from settlements in U.S. dollars. The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), for example, are encouraging the use of local currencies in international trade and financial transactions.
 
While acknowledging a growing de-dollarization trend, the Indian minister questioned: “The main point is that … there are arrangements, but the transactions which are taking place, how many percent is coming in rupees?” He noted: “We heard about decoupling. But these international arrangements, trading arrangements, payment arrangements, these have been in place for a long time.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent developments, Electricite du Laos (EDL) announced on August 24 that the power company shut down cryptocurrency mining activities. This decision came after this summer’s unprecedented heat surge escalated electricity demands. Furthermore, these mining operations have reportedly been defaulting on their debts.
 
Laos’ Crypto Mining Grinds to a Halt Amid Energy Crisis
 
Situated in Southeast Asia, Laos, surrounded by nations like Myanmar, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand, has reportedly halted its crypto mining. Interestingly, Laos relies on hydropower for a significant 95% of the country’s electricity generation.
 
Over the first half of 2023, EDL’s hydropower stations have been overwhelmed with electricity consumption. The scorching heat is a major factor driving this soaring demand. But that’s not all; the Laos government states that regional mining activities haven’t cleared their dues. Notably, Laos has been increasingly open to cryptocurrency operations since 2021.
 
As highlighted by Vietnam Plus, back in September 2021, the Laotian government green-lighted six companies to dive into crypto mining and trading. Fast forward to January 2022, the Bank of Laos endorsed two crypto trading platforms, Lao Digital Assets Exchange (LDX) and Bitqik, setting them apart as the nation’s sole regulated entities offering comprehensive cryptocurrency services.
 
 
By May 2022, Laos inaugurated a dedicated cryptocurrency mining venture in its Champasack Province. This landmark event was spearheaded by Lao Crypto Mining in collaboration with AIF Group. As of August 2022, projections showed Laos raking in nearly $190 million in tax revenues from crypto-related operations by year’s end. However, the recent shutdown report leaves us in the dark about its duration and the outstanding amount owed by the mining businesses.
