        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a significant move, Google has begun indexing Bitcoin blockchain data into its search engine results. Users can now search for Bitcoin addresses and see transaction details directly in Google searches.

NEW: Google has recently started indexing #Bitcoin data into their search engine 👀
Huge Development 👏 pic.twitter.com/hIAJfLkYXh
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 28, 2024
  
  
  
This integration comes after years of Google's rocky relationship with Bitcoin. The tech giant banned Bitcoin-related ads in 2018 before reversing course in January 2024 and allowing Bitcoin ETF ads after their approval earlier this year. The policy change signaled Google's warming stance.
Now, displaying Bitcoin data in search results greatly expands public access to on-chain activity. With Google processing over 3.5 billion searches daily, basic Bitcoin blockchain data is now conveniently available alongside standard web results.
Currently, Google is allowing three address formats - P2PKH, P2SH, and Bech32. When searching any of these Bitcoin public addresses, users will see the current balance, its last update and the balance as of the last transaction.
The move is significant given Google's vast global user base. Mainstream Bitcoin adoption depends partly on accessible tools for exploring and understanding the Bitcoin blockchain, and Google search democratizes this capability to some extent.
For now, Bitcoiners are applauding Google for the incremental integration. By surfacing primary data alongside standard results, Google has opened the door to broader on-chain literacy. If adoption continues growing, more comprehensive indexing may be close behind.]]></summary>

James Murphy revealed his insights on the legal dispute in an interview with Scott Melker on the Wolf where he examined the SEC’s damages theory in the case. According to Murphy, Ripple recently had a very lucky break, which he perceives as the bigger argument in the court case.

Indonesia, the Financial Services Authority (OJK) has announced that crypto

New Measure to Enhance Crypto Sector Security
Under the new regulatory framework, firms offering crypto

The US Department of Justice submitted 52 victim impact statements to the court, painting a grim picture of lives upended and dreams shattered. A former member of the FTX Unsecured Creditors Committee detailed the loss of his entire $4 million life savings, forcing him out of work and into a deep depression. The incident, according to his statement, even strained his marriage.
