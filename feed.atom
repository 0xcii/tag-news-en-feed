Serum, Solana, And FTT Take Front And Center
 
For the past week, the majority of the crypto market has been rallying, following in the footsteps of bitcoin which had reached levels not seen since before the FTX crash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana started the week trading near a two-month high, as momentum remained marginally bullish, despite market consolidation. The global cryptocurrency market cap is currently trading 0.98% higher as of writing. Shiba inu also traded close to recent highs, despite declines on Monday. 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) remained near a two-month high to start the week, despite crypto markets beginning to consolidate recent gains.
 
SOL/USD hit an intraday high of $24.75 on Monday, which comes less than a day after falling to a bottom of $22.68.
 
This move means that the token remains close to this weekend’s high of $25.03, which was the strongest point for SOL since November 8.
 
 
From the chart, it appears as sentiment in solana is still somewhat bullish, which comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to track above a support point at 80.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 80.18, with solana trading at the $23.42 price point.
 
Should the index remain about 80.00 in the coming days, it is likely that SOL could once again move toward $25.00.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Like SOL, shiba inu (SHIB) bypassed today’s price consolidation, maintaining recent highs in the process.
 
Following a low of $0.00001009 on Sunday, SHIB/USD climbed to a peak of $0.00001099 earlier today.
 
Monday’s action has seen the meme coin continue to trade near the two-month high of $0.00001111, hit last Friday.
 
 
Like many cryptocurrencies last week, prices of shiba inu were mostly overbought in recent days, with the RSI falling from a ceiling at 80.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 73.00, with a floor at the 70.00 mark a possible target for sellers.
 
However, bulls seem to be rejecting this proposition on Monday, with some eyeing a rally back above $0.00001100 instead.

Barely a week into 2023, and I’ve seen Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano debate Michael Shellenberger and Joe Rogan interview Peter Ziehan. While these media impressions may seem unrelated, a common thread is sewn between the two: experts in different fields confidently professing uninformed opinions on Bitcoin. 
Ziehan’s misunderstandings can be heard in the last 20 minutes or so of the interview. In fact, our friend Guy Swann just made a nearly 90-minute long episode of “Bitcoin Audible” dedicated to teari…]]></summary>

The RBI governor, Shaktikanta Das, has again expressed severe concerns about regulating the industry. This has kept crypto investors and enthusiasts on their guard as the annual budget date draws closer. The Central Bank of India has now issued a stern warning against the use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.

As per data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, multiple Bitcoin holder groups have displayed some strong accumulation recently.

The wallet groups here refer to ranges that denote the upper and lower bound for the number of coins that each wallet in a given group is currently holding. For instance, the 1-10 coins band includes all wallets that are carrying at least 1 BTC and at most 10 BTC right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining still has a bad reputation among politicians and in the mainstream media due to its large energy consumption. However, the Bitcoin Mining Council, initiated by Michael Saylor, tries to disprove that this is only half the truth with its quarterly reports.
 
Bitcoin is powered by almost 60% green energy. But even on a small scale, BTC mining can do big wonders, according to a new report from MIT Technology Review that was shared by Saylor via Twitter.
 
Virunga National Park is the first national park in the world to recognize the potential of Bitcoin mining, supporting nature, the park’s endangered mountain gorillas, and the resident community.
 
As the report discusses, the Bitcoin mine is powered by the giant hydroelectric plant on the same mountain that makes the national …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated on Jan. 16, as U.S. markets closed in celebration of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday celebration. Traders have seemingly moved to secure recent gains, after the world’s largest cryptocurrency rose above $21,000 for the first time since November. Ethereum also retreated from recent highs in today’s session. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated to start the week, as prices failed to break out of a key resistance level.
 
Following a high of $21,345.25 on Sunday, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $20,681.98 earlier in today’s session.
 
This drop comes as the world’s largest cryptocurrency was unable to move beyond its long-term ceiling at $21,400.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this was somewhat expected, due to the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovering in overbought territory.
 
As of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 86.65, after failing to move north of the 90.00 mark.
 
It is likely that further declines could be on the cards this week, with a floor of $20,000 a potential target for sellers.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also retreated from recent highs, which comes after a failed breakout of its own.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,529.79 earlier today, which comes after trading at a high of $1,579.48 on Sunday.
 
Ethereum failed to sustain a move above a ceiling at $1,580, giving way to a resurgence of some bearish sentiment.
 
 
Like with bitcoin, ethereum prices were significantly overbought, with the index at its highest point since January 2021.
 
Now tracking at 83.46, the next visible floor seems to be at the 70.00 mark, which if hit, could see ETH trading near $1,475.
