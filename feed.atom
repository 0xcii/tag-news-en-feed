Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Has Surged Into Overheated Territory
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the market cap of the asset may be overvalued right now. The “NVT ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and transaction volume.
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means that the asset’s value (that is, the market cap) is significantly more than the network’s ability to transact coins (the transaction volume). Such a trend can suggest the coin may be overvalued right now.
 
 
On the other hand, the indicator being low implies the cryptocurrency may be underpriced at the …]]></summary>

Meanwhile, NASA, the independent agency for space research under the U.S. government, has outlined plans to retrieve an asteroid valued at $10 quintillion due to its abundance of valuable metals such as gold.

According to their analysis, Bitcoin has broken through crucial resistance levels and is currently poised to strengthen its momentum. Notably, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has surged above the 70 level, a development that, based on historical trends, could indicate the potential for another substantial upward move.
 
 
“The RSI is now beginning to be overbought and could stretch higher toward the 100 mark, as it is the norm with bullish markets. In other words, as long as it sustains the uptrend, the BTC price would be inclined to keep the rally intact,” Happel and Allemann explained.
