Brandt, known for his trading acumen, has expressed doubts about Ethereum’s longevity as a major digital currency, especially when contrasted with Bitcoin (BTC).
 
Ethereum’s Uncertain Future According To Brandt
 
Brandt’s forecast for ETH, which he shared in a post on X, centers around his belief that ETH lacks the attributes of a solid store of value. Unlike Bitcoin, which has garnered widespread acceptance as a digital gold equivalent, ETH’s functionality and escalating gas fees cast shadows on its long-term viability.

Retail Customer Access at Risk
Retail customers' ability to access crypto products faces a critical

requirements imposed by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR). While these  
measures enhance risk management, they inadvertently deny potential customers  
access to essential financial services, creating a roadblock for crypto
