        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/core-scientific-lender-72-million-bailout"/>
        <updated>2022-12-14T22:05:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The public miner may be saved by its lender as the two entities engage in attempts to restructure their debt.
Core Scientific’s lender, B Riley, has stated its intentions of loaning out $72 million to the embattled publicly traded miner. Core Scientific currently has an existing loan with B Riley totaling $42 million. The new $72 million loan would be “on favorable terms,” and aim to provide two years of runway before anticipating profitability from the company.
In the lender’s released statement it described how, “We believe that there is a path forward and have been proactive in working through a solution, specifically by providing debt on a number of unencumbered assets.” 
The mining firm has faced various headwinds in recent months. Bitcoin Magazine PRO detailed these back in late October of this year, describing how “Core Scientific is halting all debt service payments; Bitcoin holdings are now 24 — they sold 1,027 over the last month; Cash resources will be depleted by the end of the year or sooner; and Core Scientific claims Celsius owes them $5.4 million.” 
In addition to these, last week a lawsuit was filed by Kirby McInerne LLP on behalf of Core Scientific investors. 

Despite this and statements by the mining firm that bankruptcy was not off the table, B Riley states that they believe “bankruptcy is not necessary at all.” 
The lender explains that the miner’s previous loans “were made when the price of Bitcoin was significantly higher than it is today and the theoretical payoff on miners was significantly faster. These debts were incurred as part of an aggressive, ill-conceived strategy by the Company to continue to build out power facilities and expand miners while never selling Bitcoin on hand and never hedging prices … This decision combined with the fast maturity associated with mining has led the Company to its current position.”]]></summary>

Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Senator Roger Marshall (R-Kan) have introduced the “Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act Of 2022,” a bill which would have sweeping impacts on the privacy of bitcoin users.
If enacted, the bill would require custodial and self-custodial wallet providers and miners to implement know-your-customer (KYC) systems. It would also prohibit financial institutions from interacting with privacy tools such as CoinJoin in an effort to limit the ability of users to maintain their privacy. While the bill focuses on such measures in order to curb money laundering, tools such as CoinJoin simply restore the users’ ability t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana surged to a three-week high ahead of this afternoon’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting (FOMC). The token rose for a second consecutive day, hitting a key price ceiling in the process. Cardano mainly consolidated on Wednesday, as prices fell from a recent high.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was a notable gainer on Wednesday, as prices surged to a three-week high.
 
Following a low of $13.61 on Tuesday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $14.68 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result, solana moved to its strongest point since November 26, which is the last time prices were trading above a key ceiling of $14.70.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this resistance point has yet to be broken following today’s gains, with SOL trading at $14.67 as of writing.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also rose, and is currently tracking at 48.36, however it also failed to break out of a resistance level.
 
As of writing, the index remains below a ceiling of 49.00, which appears to be the main obstacle in place, preventing any further surges.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
On the other hand, cardano (ADA) moved away from a recent eight-day high, as price consolidated ahead of today’s FOMC meeting.
 
ADA/USD fell to a low of $0.3069 earlier in the day, which comes less than a day after hitting a peak at $0.3152.
 
This surge in price sent cardano to its strongest point since December 5, which is the last time price was above a ceiling of $0.3270.
 
 
From the chart, it can be seen that today’s price consolidation began following a failed breakout of the 46.00 ceiling on the RSI indicator.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 43.79, with momentum appearing to be heading for a floor at 37.60.
 
Should price strength reach this point, it is likely that ADA will be trading close to the $0.3000 support level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin investor sentiment had wavered following the implosion of the FTX crypto exchange. This had sent market sentiment to one of its lowest points for the year 2022, falling deep into the ‘Extreme Fear’ territory. However, as the market has recovered with time, investors in the space have been able to take stock of losses and readjust, with the positive CPI report boosting the faith in the market. Now, sentiment has seen a marked uptick as bulls become stronger.
 
Bitcoin Investors Leave Extreme Fear Behind
 
Over the last couple of days, bitcoin investor sentiment had been steadily improving. Data from the Fear & Greed Index shows that while the market finished last month in extreme fear, the new month has seen better levels. A six-point increase from November’s 24 has put the index at…]]></summary>
