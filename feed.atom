        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin was back in the green to start the week, despite the crypto market continuing to trend mostly lower. At the time of writing, the global market cap is down 0.59%, following a recent red wave. Ethereum classic also climbed higher on Monday, hitting a four-day high in the process.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) rose for a third consecutive session on Monday, as the token continued to move away from a recent nine-month low.
 
Following a bottom at $64.33 on Sunday, LTC/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $66.70 earlier in the day.
 
LTC has mostly been in the green since falling to its lowest point since November, during last week‚Äôs session.
 
 
As a result of recent bearish momentum, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) dropped below the 20.00 mark.
 
Currently, the index is at a reading of 21.13, which is marginally below an upcoming resistance level of 23.00.
 
If litecoin were to break out of this level, the next price target will likely be $70.00.
 
 
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
 
Additionally, ethereum classic also moved higher to start the week, following a recent drop below a floor at $15.00.
 
ETC/USD rose to a high of $15.90 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $15.38.
 
 
Today‚Äôs peak sees ethereum classic trade at its highest point since last Thursday, when price was over $16.00.
 
Price strength on ETC is now hovering around 28.00, with a ceiling of 29.00 the next obstacle to overcome.
 
Should it rise beyond this hurdle, there is a good chance that ETC will be above $16.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genesis Digital Assets (GDA), one of the worlds largest Bitcoin miners in terms of hash rate, has announced the inauguration of its new mining facility situated in the northern reaches of Sweden, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. The data center's capacity is currently 8 megawatts (MW), with plans for further expansion¬†"in the near future,"¬†and has been operational since June 2023.
The new facility is strategically located near the 417 MW Porjus Hydroelectric Power Station, known for its carbon-free electricity production. GDA aims to take advantage of this renewable energy source for its Bitcoin mining operations.
"With abundant energy sources, a pro-innovation environment, and a strong educational system that results in a great culture of innovation, we believe that Sweden is one of the best countries in the world where to mine bitcoin and expect to further invest in this beautiful region moving forward," commented Tim Carra, Head of Nordic Operations at GDA.
GDA has collaborated with a local company help to oversee the day-to-day operations of the new facility. The facility, which was once a conventional data center, marks GDA's third venture in Sweden within a three-year span, including a greenhouse data center pilot introduced in 2020.
"Our expansion of facilities in the Nordics is a testament to our unwavering commitment to utilizing green energy sources," said Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, Executive President and Co-Founder of GDA. "We aim to lead the bitcoin mining industry by setting an example for other players by minimizing our environmental impact."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded from this weekend‚Äôs low on Monday, as markets attempted to consolidate following recent losses. The cryptocurrency rose back above the $26,000 level, after a brief stint below this point. Ethereum also settled, after declines over the weekend.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was marginally higher to start the week, as the cryptocurrency climbed back above the $26,000 level on Monday.
 
Following a low of $25,919.02 on Sunday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak at $26,260.68 earlier in the day.
 
Overall, bitcoin traders seem to have found a semi-stable floor around the $25,900 mark, and now look set to potentially recover some of last week‚Äôs gains.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Looking at the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 20.57, which is still deep in the oversold region.
 
This could work out to benefit bulls however, as bearish momentum may be fully exhausted after last week‚Äôs run.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was marginally higher on Monday, as price continued to settle around a new support point.
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,692.33 to start the week, as bulls attempted to take the world‚Äôs second largest cryptocurrency back above $1,700.
 
The jump in price came as ethereum settled on a support point around the $1,650 mark, with bulls using this as a point of reentry.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Similar to bitcoin above, the 14-day RSI remains oversold, and is currently tracking around the 25.00 region.
 
From the chart, the next visible point of resistance seems to be at the 31.00 level, which bulls will likely be targeting.
 
Should they break out of this point, ETH will likely move back above $1,700.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nodal Power, who¬†mitigates methane at landfills by powering Bitcoin mining data centers,¬†announced that the company has successfully raised $13 million in a seed funding round aimed at aggressively curbing methane emissions from landfills while harnessing their latent energy potential, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.
A significant portion of the funds has already been deployed for the construction and operation of two power plants within the United States. The first site, located in the southeast US, channels the electricity generated from landfill gas into the local utility grid. This site features data center, enabling the efficient distribution of energy between the utility and the data center. 
The second site, located in the mountain west region, boasts a pioneering off-grid Bitcoin mining data center, powered by landfill gas. Plans are in place to allocate additional funding for the development of a third site, slated for early 2024. All three sites share the common goal of harnessing renewable electricity from the methane gas generated during the decomposition of organic waste in landfills.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve developed solutions, specifically for smaller landfills, that allow us to bring these overlooked resources to market,‚Äù said Nodal Power CEO Bryan Black. ‚ÄúOur technology and energy first approach have the potential to make a significant impact on local energy markets.‚Äù
Nodal Power's initiative carries the potential to substantially reduce methane emissions originating from landfills. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is known to be 25 times more adept at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The company's approach involves combusting methane gas within generators, a strategy that not only mitigates methane but also cuts down on carbon emissions when compared to traditional flaring or venting practices. This process thereby transforms a previously wasted resource into a beneficial energy source.

Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Set Another All-Time High
