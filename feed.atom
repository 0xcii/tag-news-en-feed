Digital investment products witnessed $30 million worth of outflows last week. 
 
However, this outflow deviated from the trend we normally observe, with Bitcoin taking a step back and most of the movement coming from Ethereum-based investment products. Particularly, the latest CoinShares report shows that institutional investors pulled a whopping $60.7 million from Ethereum-based investment products in just one week, the largest so far this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US judge has dismissed several core claims by the  
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a case against Binance. In a post shared by  
the cryptocurrency exchange today (Tuesday), Binance noted that the federal judge had dropped multiple important arguments brought by the SEC,  
strengthening the company's defense in the legal tussle against the watchdog.
SEC's Key Claims Rejected
Specifically, the court's decision dismissed the  
contention that crypto tokens, including Binance's native BNB and its  
fiat-backed stablecoin BUSD, could be categorized as securities. Judge Amy  
Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia  
has ruled that these tokens do not meet the criteria for securities, thereby  
rejecting the SEC's broad assertion.
