        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-addresses-holding-over-0-1-btc-near-all-time-high-amid-price-dip"/>
        <updated>2024-08-07T18:59:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin addresses with a balance of over 0.1 BTC are nearing an all-time high, according to data from Bitcoin Magazine Pro. Currently, there are 4,580,424 such addresses, just shy of the record 4,586,540, and represents a month over month increase of 27,939 addresses.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
The recent drop in Bitcoin's price from around $67,500 to $49,000 provided investors a unique buying opportunity, allowing them to accumulate Bitcoin at prices below $50,000. Even with Bitcoin currently trading in the $50,000-$60,000 range, down 24% from its all-time high, buyers continue to accumulate, potentially pushing the number of addresses with over 0.1 BTC to a new record in the near future.
This chart illustrates the number of unique addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC. Tracking this metric helps gauge Bitcoin adoption and usage over time. For instance, an increase in addresses holding small amounts of Bitcoin indicates growing adoption among new users.
A Bitcoin address, consisting of 26-35 alphanumeric characters, allows individuals to send and receive Bitcoin. Each wallet can contain multiple addresses, serving as the public-facing part necessary for transactions.
With Bitcoin’s total supply capped at 21 million, approximately 19 million have been mined to date. Estimates suggest around 3 million of these may already be lost. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction, the number of addresses holding at least 0.1 BTC is expected to rise, reflecting broader adoption and increased usage across various cohorts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With his recent audacious estimate that Bitcoin may surge to $265,000 if it keeps a price over $45,000, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has offered some relief to investors who may already be feeling there’s not much room for the crypto to grow.
 
 
The study of BTC’s market basics, especially its hashrate to market cap ratio, which points to significant development potential for the top cryptocurrency, helps one to have this hopeful view.
 
Bitcoin: Current Landscape
 
Bitcoin is now trading just a little under $57,000 and has slightly retreated over 1% in the last 24 hours. Ju’s prognosis shows, in spite of these swings, that the network foundations of Bitcoin are better than ever.
 
 
As long as the #Bitcoin price stays above $45K, it could break its all-time high again within a year, imo.

        <updated>2024-08-07T17:21:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent Bloomberg interview, Michael Saylor, executive chairman and co-founder of MicroStrategy, revealed that beyond his company's holdings, he personally owns at least 17,732 Bitcoin, currently valued at approximately $1 billion. Saylor emphasized his commitment to Bitcoin, stating, "I haven't sold any bitcoin, I continue to acquire more bitcoin. It's a great capital investment asset for an individual, a family, an institution, a corporation, or a country. And I can't see a better place to put my money."

— Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) August 7, 2024
  
  
  
Saylor described Bitcoin as "the apex property of the United States" in light of recent political developments. He highlighted U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis's proposed legislation to create a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which aims to accumulate up to 1 million BTC over time if enacted. Additionally, former President Donald Trump has pledged not to sell the nation's seized Bitcoin, famously advising at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville to "never sell your Bitcoin."

Saylor then went on to note the significant shift in political perspectives, stating, "I think that the conversation has shifted and every politician in the world has started to realize that Bitcoin is the most desirable property in cyberspace - it's the future."
Saylor concluded the interview by emphasizing the importance of holding Bitcoin as a long-term capital investment rather than spending it on frivolous things like coffee or ice cream, describing Bitcoin as "the most desirable property in the universe."]]></summary>
