This scam, associated with the notorious “Cryptoqueen” Ruja Ignatova, defrauded millions of victims worldwide, resulting in a total loss of $4 billion.
 
The 46-year old Greenwood, a citizen of the UK and Sweden, co-founded OneCoin with Ignatova in 2014. He was arrested in Thailand in 2018 and faced charges of fraud and money laundering, leading to his extradition to the US. Ignatova is a fugitive since 2017 and faces similar charges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius Network, has filed a motion to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuit against him. In the motion, Mashinsky argues the FTC has failed to allege he violated any laws or rules. His lawyers say the FTC is not entitled to monetary relief and cannot substantiate Mashinsky is currently violating the law.
 
Mashinsky Fights Back: Former Celsius CEO Challenges FTC Lawsuit, Claims No Legal Violations
 
In a memorandum filed September 11, 2023, Mashinsky’s legal team asserts the FTC complaint does not show he breached the Federal Trade Commission Act. His lawyers claim the FTC cannot seek monetary damages under the Act per a 2021 Supreme Court ruling.
 
“The complaint cannot substantiate a claim that Mashinsky ‘is violating’ or is ‘about to violate’ the law because Mashinsky resigned from his position as CEO of Celsius [on] September 27, 2023,” the court filing reads.
 
The memorandum states the FTC’s allegations fail to support that Mashinsky knowingly made false statements to deceptively obtain customer data. This purportedly does not meet the requirements to allege a violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Mashinsky’s lawyers also contend the FTC has not demonstrated grounds for monetary relief under the Act.
 
 
In their filing, Mashinsky’s attorneys ask the court to dismiss the FTC’s Federal Trade Commission Act and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act claims against him. They argue the complaint does not establish that Mashinsky broke any laws or regulations. When he was officially charged by the FTC, Mashinsky “vehemently” denied the allegations.

Additionally, a central question emerges regarding the primary role of money: should its capacity as a medium of exchange take precedence over its value preservation attributes? The following Learning and Insights explainer delves into the Austrian school of economics, shining a spotlight on Carl Menger’s “On the Origins of Money.”

According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, only 16.3% of the short-term holder supply is in profit right now. The relevant indicator here is the “percent supply in profit,” which measures the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply carrying some gains.
 
This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved/transferred at. If this previous selling price was less than the current spot price, then that particular coin currently carries a profit.
