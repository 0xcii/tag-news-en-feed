The “Mining Hashrate” refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that the miners as a whole have connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. The miners need this computing power because the BTC network uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) based consensus mechanism, where validators compete against each other to solve mathematical problems to add the next block to the chain.
 
 
As such, the Hashrate can reflect how the miners are looking at the cryptocurrency. A rise in the metric could suggest these validators are finding the asset attractive right now, so new miners are coming and/…]]></summary>
