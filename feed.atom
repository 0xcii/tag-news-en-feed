        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There has been a decline in Bitcoin that few predicted. An expert trader at Binance clarifies this tendency, arguing that it has to do with how the market behaves.
 
As the price of bitcoin rises, a lot of traders start to shift from their typical buying and selling locations. Rather, they use borrowed funds to gamble on highly volatile meme currencies in an attempt to chase after popular coins, which can fluctuate on a daily basis.
 
 
 
When prices go up and on-chain/perps start moving people don’t need slots any more, they can just long the memecoin du jour on leverage.
