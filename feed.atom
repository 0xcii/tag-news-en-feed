        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Argentinian financial markets regulator, the National  
Securities Commission (CNV), has approved the first Bitcoin-based futures  
contract, which gives investors exposure to the top cryptocurrency. It marks  
the first time the regulator is approving such a product in the  
country.
The futures contract is  
based on the Bitcoin index listed on the Argentinian securities exchange, Matba  
Rofex. Following the listing, Matba Rofex released the guidelines on how the  
futures contract will be traded in a statement yesterday (Thursday).
"The measure, which  
was adopted through a resolution, intends to facilitate adaptation to the  
regulatory challenges imposed by new technologies in the provision of financial  
products," the CNV said in a statement translated from Spanish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose towards the $32,000 mark late on Thursday, as markets reacted to the news that a U.S. judge ruled that XRP was “not necessarily a security on its face.” The ruling was well received by the crypto world, and raised optimism that other crypto companies who are currently in legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could also prevail. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was on the cusp of hitting $32,000 in the past 24 hours, following the news that XRP was not necessarily classified as a security by a U.S. judge.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $31,814.51 late on Thursday, after trading at a low of $30,486.69 earlier in the day.
 
Yesterday’s peak is the strongest point bitcoin has hit since late-May last year, which is the last time price was over $32,000.

Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have emerged as a key breakthrough in the financial  
environment, having the potential to transform our perception of and  
interaction with money. CBDCs are central bank-issued and controlled digital  
representations of a country's fiat currency. 
They have the  
ability to reform payments, increase financial inclusion, and change monetary  
policy. In this article, we will look at the rise of CBDCs and its potential  
consequences for the global financial system.
Understanding  
CBDCs: Central Bank Issued Digital Currency
CBDCs are  
digital representations of a country's legal tender issued and regulated by the  
central bank. CBDCs, unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, are

A few weeks ago, BlackRock and other major financial firms filed for permission to offer spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 
Though the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission(SEC) stated that these initial filings were inadequate, forcing the firms to refile, many investors believe that they will eventually be approved, creating the first-such products on the market. These new financial instruments would allow institutional and retail investors to access exposure to bitcoin's price without having to purchase actual bitcoin.

Following this, he was released on bail by a US District Judge on a bond of $40 million.
 
According to a court document filed on Thursday, the personal recognizance bond for Alex Mashinsky is secured by his Manhattan residence, as well as the signatures of his wife and another individual.
 
Benjamin Alee and Jonathan Ohring are the attorneys representing Alex Mashinsky, and in a statement, Ohring mentioned that Mashinsky is eager to defend himself in court against what he believes are unfounded charges.
