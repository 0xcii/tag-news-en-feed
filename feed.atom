        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recent surge in Bitcoin prices, defying earlier expectations, has intrigued both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and financial experts. While the narrative around the impending launch of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has garnered significant attention, a new report from QCP Capital suggests that macroeconomic factors are the primary driving force behind the rally. 
 
The report also highlights the impact of recent job data on the Federal Reserve’s stance, leading to a 95% probability of unchanged interest rates in December.

Bitcoin Hashrate Rise May Suggest Miners Are Gearing Up For Next Bull Run
 
The “mining hashrate” is a metric that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that’s connected to the Bitcoin blockchain right now. The metric is measured in terms of “hashes per second” (H/s), where a “hash” is basically a function the BTC miners have to perform on the network.
 
As the cryptocurrency’s hashrate has grown quite large by now, much larger units like terahashes per second (TH/s) or exahashes per second (EH/s) are used instead these days.
 
 
The hashrate can provide as a look into the interest that the miners have in the cryptocurrency right now. When the ind…]]></summary>

As a university engineering educator and a bitcoiner, I am acutely aware that education about Bitcoin is crucial to the full realization of its potential. The intrinsic properties of Bitcoin make it a sound foundation for a new monetary system. However, it will have to grow significantly in the emergent property of wide acceptance before it can challenge the status quo. Acceptance will only grow with education.
