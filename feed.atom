The poll, which asked the crypto community to assess the security threshold of ETH staked in securing the blockchain, indicated a lack of awareness about the actual risks of an attack.
 
Respondents to the poll displayed the following beliefs about Ethereum’s security:
 
 
44.9% believed that securing Ethereum requires 100% of all ETH staked, amounting to $110 billion, 31.4 million ETH.
 
20.4% thought 66.6% of staked ETH was sufficient, equivalent to $73.4 billion, 20.9 million ETH.
 
34.7% felt that only 33.3% of staked ETH, or $36.7 billion, 10.4 million ETH, was required for security.
