        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, Hong Kong-based start up Bitcoin wallet Xverse announced they have successfully closed a $5 million seed funding round, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. 
The round was spearheaded by Jump Crypto, a prominent name in the blockchain investment realm, and saw the participation of several other backers including RockawayX, Sfermion, Alliance, NGC Ventures, V3ntures, Old Fashion Research, 2140 Bitcoin Ecosystem Fund, Bitcoin Frontier Fund, Newman Capital, Franklin Templeton, New Layer Capital, Miton C, Gossamer Capital, Daxos Capital, Sora Ventures, Tyhke Block Ventures, IOBC Capital, Despread and strategic angel investors.
Founder and CEO of Xverse, Ken Liao, expressed his enthusiasm for the funding, noting, "This seed funding sends a strong signal for Bitcoin, the most decentralized and secure settlement layer." This infusion of capital bolsters Xverse's trajectory, particularly its focus on advancing DeFi, Lightning Network, and other Bitcoin scalability solutions.
Xverse, which boasts seamless compatibility with Ordinals and BRC-20 inscriptions, has witnessed a big year of growth and momentum. Garnering more than 350,000 downloads across iOS, Android, and Chrome extensions. In the ongoing pursuit of mainstream adoption, the start up focuses on the "critical touchpoint" that user experience plays.
The Bitcoin wallet has also become the first Ordinals-focused wallet to introduce cold-storage security options for both Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, in a move to ensure user assets remain safe. Since the emergence of Ordinals, Xverse has solidified its position as a premier gateway, boasting seamless integration with industry titans like OKX and Magic Eden.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-10T15:48:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chainlink declined from a recent two-week high on Thursday, as market uncertainty rose around the latest U.S. inflation report. As consumer prices rose to a reading of 3.2% in July, traders so far seem unsure on how to process this data. XRP fell by nearly 5% today.
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) was back in the red during today’s session, as bulls retreated following a recent three-day win streak.
 
After moving to a peak of $7.86 on Wednesday, LINK/USD slipped to a floor of $7.57 earlier in the day.
 
Thursday’s decline sees chainlink slip away from a move towards a long-term ceiling at the $8.00 level.
 
 
One reason for the drop off appears to be due to a collision with a ceiling of 58.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Currently, price strength is at a reading of 57.27, with the next visible floor at the 52.00 mark.
 
Should bears hit this target, LINK will likely be trading at $7.00.
 
 
XRP
 
Another notable token to fall today was XRP, which fell by as much as 5% during today’s session.
 
After peaking at $0.6623 during yesterday’s session, XRP/USD plunged to a bottom at the $0.6253 level.
 
Overall, XRP, formerly ripple, has been on the decline since its peak of $0.9479 on July 13, which was a 20-month high.
 
 
The latest drop coincided with the RSI failing to break out of a key resistance zone at the 46.00 region.
 
In the event momentum remains bearish throughout the week, XRP could be moving towards $0.5000.
