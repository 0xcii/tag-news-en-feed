        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dennis Kelleher, the CEO of Better Markets, has revealed who is more likely to win if an appeal occurs in the legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Both parties have not intended to appeal the case, although it remains a possibility. 
 
 
The SEC Has A 90% Of Winning An Appeal
 
Kelleher mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the SEC has a 90% chance of winning on appeal in its long-running legal battle against Ripple. The Better Markets CEO explained that Judge Analisa Torres got “90 years of law upside down” when she ruled that institutional investors were protected by the securities laws, not retail investors. He further claimed that other Judges have chosen not to follow the ruling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining has long been embroiled in controversy. From Greenpeace’s high-profile “Change the Code, Not the Climate” campaign to Alex DeVries' exaggerated claims about Bitcoin’s growing "water footprint," the media often portrays Bitcoin mining as an environmental disaster in the making. For the general public, who are genuinely concerned about environmental preservation but lack in-depth knowledge of Bitcoin mining, these narratives are alarming. As a relatively young and seemingly complex industry, much of this misleading negative publicity sticks, while the significant societal benefits of Bitcoin mining are often ignored. This persistent fud has fueled a political crusade against Bitcoin mining, drawing in figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, and e…]]></summary>
