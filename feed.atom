        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DIBA, the first Bitcoin NFT marketplace utilizing RGB smart contracts, has officially launched on mainnet. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the platform also introduces BitMask, an exclusive Bitcoin-only wallet capable of storing unique digital assets (UDAs) such as music and art. The UDAs will be hosted on high availability storage and cloud services provided by Hut 8, a publicly traded bitcoin miner in North America.
DIBA aims to bring Bitcoin utility to the masses by enabling the exchange of UDAs on a decentralized and censorship-resistant network. Notable bitcoin investors, including Tim Draper of Draper Associates and Bill Tai of ACTAI Unicorn Fund, support the venture. Gideon Nweze, founder and CEO of DIBA, expressed his excitement about the launch, stating, "This marks a major milestone in the transition of the internet onto Bitcoin."
Tim Draper also commended DIBA's innovative approach, emphasizing the potential of NFTs on Bitcoin. He said, "What Gideon and the team at DIBA have built is a testament to the potential NFTs on Bitcoin hold in capturing the creative and sovereign spirit of this next generation."
DIBA's partnership with Hut 8 is another example of the optimism surrounding Bitcoin and Layer 1 and 2 protocols. Josh Rayner, VP of High Performance Computing at Hut 8, expressed support for the Bitcoin NFT platform, stating, "We are bullish on Bitcoin and the potential of Layer 1 and 2 protocols, and are proud to support DIBA's Bitcoin NFT platform with high availability storage and cloud services."
According to the press release, the DIBA marketplace utilizes both the RGB smart contract protocol on Bitcoin, as well as the Lightning Network to maximize the efficiency of the marketplace’s functions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was marginally lower on Saturday, as bulls seemingly secured gains, following a recent six-day winning streak. The token, which has risen by nearly 10% in the past week, remains close to a three-week high. Polkadot remained in the green to start the weekend.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, remained close to a multi-week high to start the weekend, despite bulls moving to secure recent gains.
 
Following a peak at $0.4738 on Friday, XRP/USD declined to a bottom at $0.4627 earlier in the day.
 
Despite the decline, XRP remained close to its strongest point since April 30, when the price reached a top of $0.4818.
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
Looking at the chart, one of the catalysts of the move appeared to be a breakout on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
The index moved beyond the ceiling of 54.00, and as of writing, is now tracking at 56.09.
 
Bulls are likely targeting the $0.4800 mark, and could reach it this weekend, should the RSI move towards its next point of resistance at 59.00.
 
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
In addition to XRP, Polkadot (DOT) extended its own gains on Saturday, as the token rose for a second straight session.
 
DOT/USD climbed to a high of $5.41 to start the weekend, following a low at $5.33 the day prior.
 
Saturday’s move comes as polkadot continued to move away from a recent support point at $5.30.
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
The slight increase in price has also led to the RSI moving towards resistance at 42.00, which is acting as an obstacle to further bullish pressure.
 
There is a good chance that DOT could make a run towards $6.00, should this current ceiling give way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the weekend in consolidation, as markets remained nervous despite somewhat dovish comments from U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Speaking on Friday, Powell stated that rates may not be increased by as much as initially expected. Ethereum rose marginally higher today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated below $27,000 to start the weekend, despite dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
 
Following a high of $27,128.62 during yesterday’s session, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,700.21 earlier today.
 
The move sees bitcoin remain relatively close to a floor at $26,300, and comes despite optimism that the Fed could soon begin to ease monetary policy.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the volatility in the market comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continues to track below a key resistance level.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 40.75, which is below a ceiling at 42.00
 
In order for BTC to remain firmly above $27,000, and begin to head towards $28,000, this point will need to be broken.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) on the other hand was marginally higher on Saturday, as prices remained above $1,800.
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,826.19 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after nearly dropping below $1,800.
 
Since dropping to a floor at $1,790 earlier in the week, ETH bulls have managed to keep price away from this point.
 
 
Similar to BTC, ethereum’s RSI continues to hover below a resistance point at 46.00, and is now at a reading of 44.84.
 
A breakout will also need to occur at this zone, in order for bullish momentum to fully return to ethereum.
