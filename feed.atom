With its native cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) and smart contract functionality, Ethereum aimed to become a decentralized world computer that could execute peer-to-peer agreements and applications.
 
Over the past eight years, Ethereum has cemented itself as the leading smart contract platform, enabling a new wave of decentralized applications across finance, gaming, collectibles and more. It’s also established itself as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind only Bitcoin in terms of importance.

Bitcoin Active Addresses Have Taken A Hit Recently
 
As an analyst on X pointed out, the active addresses metric may signal that the network activity has dropped recently. The “daily active addresses” is an indicator that measures the total number of addresses taking part in some transaction activity on the blockchain daily.
 
This metric naturally counts both the senders and receivers. It only accounts for unique addresses, meaning that even if a wallet makes several transactions in a single day, its contribution towards the indicator’s value will remain one unit.
