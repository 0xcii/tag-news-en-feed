Bitcoin Long/Short-Term Holder Supply Ratio Has Spiked Recently
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the Long/Short-Term Holder Supply Ratio has observed a sharp rise recently. The “Short-Term Holders” (STHs) and the “Long-Term Holders” (LTHs) are the two main divisions of the Bitcoin userbase based on holding time.
 
The investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days are classified under the former group, while those who have held onto their coins for longer than this period fall into the latter.
