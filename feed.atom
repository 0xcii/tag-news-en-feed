On Tuesday, January 30, the SEC announced its intention to dismiss its high-profile case against the crypto firm DEBT Box.
 
The case, which originally accused DEBT Box of defrauding investors out of nearly $50 million by selling unregistered securities, took an unexpected turn when the SEC sought to withdraw their lawsuit. This decision follows a series of events where the SEC faced potential sanctions from Judge Robert Shelby of the Northern Division District Court of Utah for reportedly misleading the court.

The “mining hashrate” refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of computing power connected to the Bitcoin blockchain by the miners.
 
When the value of this indicator goes up, it means that new miners are joining the network, and old ones are expanding their facilities. Such a trend implies that interest in blockchain mining is currently high.
 
 
On the other hand, the metric heading down implies some miners have decided to disconnect from the chain, potentially because they aren’t finding it profitable to mine anymore.
