        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/sec-requests-additional-four-months-to-submit-documents-in-coinbase-case/"/>
        <updated>2024-09-19T18:14:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has requested an additional four months to produce documents in the legal tussle with Coinbase. In  
a recent filing with the US District Court for the Southern District of New  
York, the regulator argued that it requires more time to review an extensive  
collection of 133,582 documents. 
The extension, if granted by Judge Katherine Failla,  
could push the document production deadline to February 2025,  
potentially delaying any courtroom proceedings until next year, Cointelegraph  
reported. 
More Time to Review Thousands of Documents
Initially scheduled to produce documents by October  
18, the SEC has argued that reviewing the extensive collection of documents  
requires more time. This request, filed on September 18, aims to extend the  
deadline for fact discovery to February 18, 2025, with expert discovery  
potentially concluding by April 22, 2025.
The ongoing legal battles involving the SEC and major  
crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken are part of a broader  
regulatory scrutiny of digital assets. Recent rulings against Ripple Labs and Terraform Labs  
highlight the regulator's aggressive stance on unregistered securities. 
 Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Bitcoin’s Future Growth Unaffected By Election Outcomes

Bankruptcy and Liquidation
Silvergate is set to use its remaining $163 million to

2019 to $14.3 billion by 2021, with over half of these deposits coming from  
digital asset exchange customers. 
However, this rapid expansion came with its risks. The

However, the tide is starting to turn as there could be a recovery trend for the crypto market very soon. To this end, a crypto founder has identified the best and worst times to be an investor in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Going by his prediction, the worst could be over for Bitcoin, and the market could be for a great time soon.
 
Best And Worst Time To Be In Bitcoin
 
Charles Edwards, founder of digital assets-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments, took to X (formerly Twitter), to share when he thinks is the best a worst time to be in Bitcoin. In the post, Edwards attached a screenshot of quarterly returns for Bitcoin, showing the best and worst-performing quarters.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Supply Plunges As Investors HODL
 
As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the 30-day change in the short-term holder supply has plunged deep into the negative territory recently.
 
The “short-term holders” (STHs) are the Bitcoin investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. This cohort is one of the two main segments of the BTC market divided based on holding time, with the other group being known as the “long-term holders” (LTHs).
