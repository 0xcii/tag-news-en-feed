        <updated>2023-08-24T16:09:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana continued to trade higher during Tuesday’s session, following a recent breakout below a support point of $20.00. Momentum in the market has begun to gradually pick up in recent days, ahead of Friday’s Federal Reserve Jackson Hole annual meeting. BNB remained in the green.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana was one of Thursday’s notable movers, as price rose to a one-week high earlier in today’s session.
 
Following yesterday’s decline to a low of $20.66, SOL/USD rose to a high at $21.99 on Thursday.
 
As a result, the token hit its strongest level since last Thursday, when the price peaked at $23.41.
 
 
This recent run comes following a drop below a support point of $20.00, prompting bulls to move in and buy the weakness.
 
The surge also pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) to a collision with a ceiling at 44.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 40.38, with earlier gains fading.
 
 
BNB
 
Similar to solana, BNB also jumped to a one-week high on Thursday, only two days after trading at a one-year low.
 
Bulls sent BNB/USD to a peak of $216.39 earlier in today’s session, after the price was at a bottom of $204.40 the day prior.
 
The native coin of cryptocurrency exchange , has now climbed higher for a third straight day, following recent bearish sentiment.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the RSI here has marginally broken out of a resistance zone at the 30.00 mark, and is currently tracking at 32.93.
 
Should momentum continue to move higher, the next visible point of resistance is at 37.00, and should this be reached, BNB will most certainly be trading beyond $220.00.

When Bitcoin Price Could Reach $150,000
 
The “Blockchain Letter” released by Pantera Capital meticulously analyzes BTC’s past halving events and their subsequent impact on its price. The firm noted, “Bitcoin experienced the longest period of negative year-over-year returns in its history, lasting 15 months (2/8/22–6/12/23).” Drawing parallels to the previous longest downturn, they added, “The longest period prior was just under a year (11/14/14–10/31/15).”

defending Sam Bankman-Fried have been granted permission to conduct “unlimited”

The new

inadequate”. In a letter to US District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan, the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded from recent lows on Thursday, as bulls moved to buy the dip, following a drop below the $26,000 level. The rally comes as traders rejected a full breakout below a key support point of $25,600. Ethereum was also back in the green during today’s session. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin climbed higher on Thursday, as bulls moved to buy the recent dip in price, following a drop below the $26,000 level.
 
After trading at a low of $25,805.00 on Wednesday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak of $26,786.90 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the strongest point that bitcoin has hit since last Thursday, when the cryptocurrency was trading above the $28,000 mark.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge sent the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) to a ceiling of 28.00, which is also a one-week high.
 
As of writing, price strength has moved below this point, however should a breakout occur, there is a good chance that BTC will head above $27,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also back in the green, and neared a breakout above the $1,700 zone late on Wednesday.
 
ETH/USD rallied to a high of $1,696.59 during yesterday’s session, less than 24 hours after the price was at a bottom $1,634.87.
 
Like with BTC above, today saw ethereum trade at its highest point in a week, with price peaking above $1,800 last Thursday.
 
 
The 14-day RSI has also collided with a key resistance level, in this occasion at the 34.00 zone.
 
Sentiment has marginally shifted, with the index now at 32.04, resulting in the easing of earlier gains.
