‘Conditional’ Approval Crypto ETFs
Although the regulator confirmed the conditional approval, it did not reveal any details of the ETFs. The regulatory conditions include fee payments, document filings, and approval of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's listing, according to Reuters.
Crypto ETFs are listed on stock exchanges and can be traded from regular brokerage accounts without the need to create a crypto exchange account or use custodial services. These investment products lower the entry barrier and complexity of investment into cryptocurrencie…]]></summary>

However, while the approval brings excitement, Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas offered a more cautious analysis of the potential inflows into the newly approved market. 
 
Balchunas claims that Hong Kong ETFs are expected to lag significantly behind their US counterparts, which have amassed more than $200 billion in Bitcoin ETFs trading volume since trading began in January.
 
Obstacles For Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs
 
While approving the Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong is undoubtedly a positive development, Balchunas took to social media to temper expectations.

The Runes Protocol, developed by the mind behind the Ordinal Theory, Casey Rodarmor, is generating buzz as it introduces a new fungible token standard for Bitcoin. 
 
A recent report by crypto analysis firm Delphi Digital sheds light on the potential of Runes to disrupt the tokenization landscape, challenging the dominance of BRC-20s. 
 
A Glimpse Into The Runes Protocol
 
Unlike its predecessors, Runes is not a token itself but rather a framework that enables the creation of altcoins on the Bitcoin Network. Tokens created using the Runes Protocol, aptly named “Runes,” are fungible, meaning each Rune is interchangeable.
