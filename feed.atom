        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced today, Tether, the leading stablecoin issuer, has emerged with a robust balance sheet showcasing ownership of over $2.8 billion in Bitcoin. The information comes to light following an audit conducted by BDO, a renowned auditing firm, as detailed in the official auditor's report.



The audited report provides a comprehensive analysis of Tether's financial standing, including more information on its Bitcoin holdings. Tether, known for its stablecoin USDT, has consistently played a massive role in the cryptocurrency market, facilitating transactions and maintaining a peg to the US Dollar.
"At Tether, we look forward to great 2024, with many new projects and products ready to come alive," said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. "I'm really excited by Tether's expansion. While Tether is mostly known for one product (USDT), the company is becoming an investor and infrastructure builder in many strategical sectors, spacing from AI to P2P telecommunications, from Bitcoin mining to renewable energy production."
The company also had a $2.85 billion profit for last quarter, of which about $1.85 billion came from gold and bitcoin holdings. For all of 2023, Tether achieved a profit of $6.2 billion.]]></summary>

We're talking a massive leap, over 140% in value – that's huge! It's not just about topping traditional rivals like gold; it's also about leaving other cryptocurrencies in the rearview mirror. Let’s dive into the on-chain action and the exchange buzz, trying to piece together clues to see what Bitcoin might be up to in the coming year. 
Bitcoin's Blast from the Past
According to Glassnode's report, we’re seeing a déjà vu with Bitcoin cycles in 2015-2017 and 2018-2022 in terms of how long it's taking to bounce back and the drawdown since the all-time high (ATH).

New York Community Bancorp Shares Suffer 45% One-Day Collapse
 
In March of 2023, Bitcoin made a huge move from its bottom range on the heels of a collapse in the banking system. Back then, Signature, Silicon Valley, and Silvergate each saw extensive bank failures. The shares of each bank sank ahead of the failures, tipping off the market that something was awry. Silvergate, in particular, was later acquired by New York Community Bancorp in the aftermath.

Passed down through generations like a cherished heirloom, the ownership of mineral rights is more than a legal claim; it is a cultural emblem, a symbol of resilience, and a precious legacy. The wealth and prosperity created for mineral rights owners in Texas over time through the extraction and production of hydrocarbon minerals is tremendous but also comes with a heavy responsibility. That responsibility demands a farsighted financial perspective and a commitment to ethical and environmental stewardship to ensure the well-being of future generations who will inherit the mineral estate.

        <updated>2024-01-31T16:08:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, Chris Larsen, the co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple, publicly revealed that several of his personal xrp accounts had been illicitly accessed. Larsen explained that the team successfully persuaded crypto exchanges to promptly freeze the affected addresses.
 
$112.5 Million Transferred From Chris Larsen’s Accounts
 
In the realm of social media, specifically within the X community, there is a growing fervor surrounding a substantial transfer of XRP from Chris Larsen’s XRP accounts. The initial revelation came from onchain analyst Zachxbt, who swiftly shared the information, stating, “It appears Ripple was hacked for ~213M XRP ($112.5M).” This development ignited a wave of intense speculation and discussion across various social media platforms.
 
Larsen addressed the situation on X and said that his personal xrp accounts were affected. “Yesterday, there was unauthorized access to a few of my personal XRP accounts (not Ripple) – we were quickly able to catch the problem and notify exchanges to freeze the affected addresses,” Larsen said. “Law enforcement is already involved,” the Ripple executive added.
 
 
XRP initially dropped 5% on the news against the U.S. dollar and 24-hour statistics as of 10:40 p.m. Eastern Time, show XRP is down 3.5%. Of course, many speculators are wondering what happened with Larsen’s account and how the actors were able to access 213 million XRP from his stash. As of right now, it is a compelling mystery until more answers come out.
