        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent poll conducted by Christine Kim, a researcher at Galaxy Digital, has revealed significant misconceptions within the Ethereum community regarding the blockchain’s economic security. The poll, which asked the crypto community to assess the security threshold of ETH staked in securing the blockchain, indicated a lack of awareness about the actual risks of an attack.
 
Respondents to the poll displayed the following beliefs about Ethereum’s security:
 
 
44.9% believed that securing Ethereum requires 100% of all ETH staked, amounting to $110 billion, 31.4 million ETH.
 
20.4% thought 66.6% of staked ETH was sufficient, equivalent to $73.4 billion, 20.9 million ETH.
 
34.7% felt that only 33.3% of staked ETH, or $36.7 billion, 10.4 million ETH, was required for security.

The culmination of this lengthy dispute marks a significant victory for Hodlonaut and casts further doubt on Wright’s assertions regarding his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto.
 
 
The origins of this legal feud trace back to May 2019 when Wright filed a lawsuit against Hodlonaut over critical social media posts.
 
Hodlonaut, a Norwegian Bitcoiner, had publicly accused Wright of being a “scammer” and a “fraud” for his claims of creating Bitcoin. This sparked a contentious legal battle that spanned multiple years and jurisdictions.
