Despite its previously sluggish price momentum, Dogecoin witnessed a massive $800 million increase in open interest over the weekend.

Allegations of False Claims and Withdrawal Woes
According to the SFC, EDY is purported to be a virtual asset

The conversation was sparked by a post from “Autism Capital,” a crypto influencer with significant clout in the crypto dialogue, who lamented Buterin’s reduced engagement on X, advocating for its potential to significantly uplift Ethereum’s presence.
 
Why Is The Ethereum Founder Avoiding X?
 
“Vitalik needs to get back on X. Farcaster isn’t going to win the culture war. If he wants Ethereum to shine he should engage more on this platform, not sequester himself with his chosen peers on an island. He will have far more impact if he engages the bigger community here,” Autism Capital stated.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Sold Big In Past 30 Days
 
As explained by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a post on X, the Bitcoin network has observed multiple transactions involving a large amount of dormant coins.
 
Transfers involving old coins are attributed to the “long-term holder” (LTH) cohort. The LTHs refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago.
 
 
Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell or transfer the tokens at any point. As such, the LTHs are considered the more resolute part of the market.
