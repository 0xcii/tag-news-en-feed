Bitcoin Has Registered A Drop Of 7% In The Last 24 Hours
 
Right after setting a fresh all-time high (ATH) not too far from the $74,000 level, the Bitcoin price has reversed its trajectory sharply during the past day.
 
 
The below chart shows how the digital asset has performed recently.

Since this low, BTC has made a slight recovery back to $67,600, meaning that it has experienced a decline of almost 7% in the last 24 hours. As is o…]]></summary>
