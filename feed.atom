Feeding the Grown and the Growing
Stern, Burke and Bruns (2016)7 concluded in their analysis that access to electricity is not sufficient for economic growth but that electricity use and GDP have a positive relationship. Simply providing the availability of a resource does not dictate advancement, it is the use that results in advancement. Common sense.

“As a result, energy is an essential factor of production and continuous supplies of energy are needed to maintain existing levels of economic activity as well as to grow and develop the economy (Stern, 1997). There may also be macroeconomic limits to substitution of other inputs for energy. The construction, operation, and maintenance of tools…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s U.K. division, Chase UK, is putting the brakes on cryptocurrency-related payments. Come October 16, any Chase UK customers attempting to make a bank transfer or card payment linked to crypto will find themselves thwarted.
 
Chase UK to Halt Crypto Payments in Mid-October
 
Chase UK customers are about to hit a roadblock for payments tied to cryptocurrency dealings. The bank’s rationale? A spike in scams and fraud. An email from the institution cautions, “If we think you’re making a payment related to crypto assets, we’ll decline it.”
 
A representative from Chase verified the email’s legitimacy to Bloomberg and shed light on their stance. Coindesk’s Sandali Handagama also reported on the Chase UK email on Tuesday prior to Bloomberg’s confirmation.
 
“We’ve seen an increase in the number of crypto scams targeting U.K. consumers, so we have taken the decision to prevent the purchase of crypto assets on a Chase debit card or by transferring money to a crypto site from a Chase account,” the Chase spokesperson revealed.
 
 
Chase made its move after a series of regulatory overhauls in the United Kingdom within the past six months. For instance, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new guidelines for the crypto industry. Concurrently, the financial powerhouse Paypal has briefly suspended U.K.-based crypto transactions, pointing to these regulatory adjustments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash rose by as much as 5% on Tuesday, as bulls extended recent gains following last week’s consolidation. The token rose for a second consecutive session, moving closer to a resistance level of $225 in the process. BNB also climbed, pushing towards a ceiling of its own at $220.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was a notable gainer in today’s session, as the cryptocurrency climbed for a second straight day.
 
Following a low of $206.86 to start the week, BCH/USD peaked at $213.89 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw bitcoin cash close in on a resistance level of $225, which was last reached on September 18.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average remained above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) has broken out of a ceiling at 52.00, and is now tracking at 54.50.
 
A point of resistance at 60.00 now seems to be the next target for bulls, and if hit, BCH will more than likely be above $225.
 
 
BNB
 
BNB, formerly binance coin, was another big mover on Tuesday, as the token rose for a back-back session.
 
BNB/USD reached a high of $213.19 earlier in the day, after starting the week at a low of $208.02.
 
Overall, the native token of cryptocurrency exchange Binance now seems to be pushing for a ceiling of $220.
 
 
In order to reach this, BNB bulls will need to surpass an upcoming resistance point of 47.00 on the RSI indicator.
 
At the time of writing, BNB is now at a reading of 44.41, with the token trading marginally lower at $211.74.
