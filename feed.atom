Bitcoin Supply Grows More Dormant As HODLing Continues
 
In a new post on X, analyst James V. Straten shared a chart showing how the Bitcoin supply held by the different long-term holder segments has changed over the asset’s history.
 
The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to those investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago. The holders who own coins with an age less than this threshold are known as the “short-term holders” (STHs).
 
 
Statistically, the longer a holder keeps their coins dormant, the less likely they become to move them at any point. Due to this reason, the LTHs are the more resolute group of the …]]></summary>

What if I told you that they are modern-day heroes of the free market economy, bravely providing their economic services despite facing universal scorn and outlawry? These individuals are unquestionably heroes, forged by the unjust treatment at the hands of society and of the state apparatus. If you don’t like the idea of them being heroes, then the only way to deprive them of this stature is to remove the shackles that misguided people have placed upon them. This rogue’s gallery of scapegoats is worthy of our vindication.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an era desperate for financial literacy, Cash App has taken a “kneaded” step with the launch of "BREAD," a free zine that fuses financial education with culture. The inaugural issue, aptly titled the "Bitcoin Issue," promises to demystify the world and culture of Bitcoin, and hopefully reshape public perceptions. With a strong team of influential artists and writers, including Allison Davis, Richard Turley, and Daisuke, BREAD aims to make money more relatable and accessible to a diverse audience.
 
         
         
         
         
    
At the heart of BREAD's mission is a commitment to transforming the often intimidating world of finance and Bitcoin into a realm that resonates with everyday people. By merging financial education with cultural insights, BREAD seeks to break down barriers and make complex concepts, such as Bitcoin, more approachable. The zine's debut issue takes on the challenge of separating the wheat from the chaff in Bitcoin, offering readers a fresh and purposefully inclusive perspective on this increasingly influential asset.
The "Bitcoin Issue" offers readers a visual gluten-filled feast to complement the zine's educational content, with design hoping to elevate the reader's experience, ensuring that BREAD is not just informative but also visually engaging.
 
         
         
         
         
    
The “Bitcoin Issue” of BREAD made its debut on December 7, with physical copies available in select stores across major U.S. cities. However, recognizing the global interest in financial education and cultural exploration, Cash App has also made the zine accessible online. This online platform allows readers worldwide to preview the zine and order a free print copy.
As the inaugural "Bitcoin Issue" begins to rise, BREAD intends to set the stage for a new era where financial literacy is not only accessible but also an integral part of our cultural conversation.

Dogecoin Wallet Account Hack “Well Planned And Diabolically Timed”
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Dogecoin influencer Mishaboar stated that the hack on MyDoge’s X account was “well planned and diabolically timed.” Regarding the timing, the influencer was referring to the fact that it occurred on Dogecoin’s anniversary. He believes that the hack was done to hijack this “special Dogecoin day.”
