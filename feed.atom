Bitcoin Has Rallied Towards The $57,000 Level In The Past Day
 
After the initial rally to the $52,000 level earlier in the month, Bitcoin slumped into an extended spell of sideways movement, refusing to show any strong momentum in either direction.
 
 
Things have very quickly changed for the cryptocurrency in the past day, however, as its price has finally shown a sharp rally. The chart below shows what the coin’s trajectory has looked like recently.
 

 
 
As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin’s tight consolidation has just decompressed in spectacular fashion, as the asset has soared almost 11% within the past 24 hours.
