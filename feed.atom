        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector recorded massive losses in 2022. While many expected a different story in 2023, bad actors have continued their game of exploiting DeFi. Some days back, Hedera revealed a loss of liquidity pools tokens when a hacker exploited its mainnet smart contract code.
 
 
But the latest DeFi attack occurred on Euler Finance, another decentralized finance protocol. According to on-chain sleuths, the attacker may have gotten away with more than $180 million in tokens.

Certik Alert reported the incident on Twitter, revealing that the bad actors have stolen 41 million DAI and still counting. It went further to warn users to be alert as the exploit was still ongoing at the time of the tweet.

As unrealized losses piled up, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) gradually, then suddenly became insolvent and people are beginning to wake up to issues pervading our financial system. Modern day bank runs, though digital, can force banks to sell reserve assets at a loss, inevitably leading to insolvency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The bitcoin price rocketing to $24,000 amidst the banking crisis is reflecting the world’s need for a sound money alternative.
Bitcoin remained resilient in the face of a very hesitant market Monday morning, surging past $24,000. Despite fears that the cryptocurrency industry is being cut off from banking, bitcoin is outperforming the S&P 500, which, surprisingly, didn’t sustain a major hit, up 0.7% as of the time of writing.
Last night, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and U.S. Treasury released a joint statement ensuring that Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank customer money will be guaranteed. 
This morning, President Joe Biden held a press conference in which he attempted to address the nation’s banking fears. However, the nation’s Commander in Chief walked out of the conference after having finished his prewritten statement, avoiding any questions from the public. 



In the meantime, the United States is looking at two of the largest bank failures in its history.



Perhaps the more sensible place for the nation to look for reassurance is Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a stable monetary policy — there will never be more than 21 million. In addition to this, individual users of Bitcoin can sovereignly take custody of their own money utilizing seed phrases, meaning that your funds will never fall victim to the dangerous nature of fractional reserve banking..

Money in the banks are IOUs. If people do not have custody of their money, it simply isn’t theirs. As these lessons are taught in real-time, Bitcoin will continue to thrive. This key point in time is a moment of opportunity for Bitcoiners to teach others about the values of sound money, as well as the basic fundamentals of beginning their own bitcoin custody journey.]]></summary>

Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) rose by as much as 15% to start the week, as cryptocurrency markets rebounded from recent losses.
 
LTC/USD surged to an intraday high of $79.53 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after hitting a low of $68.66.
 
The move saw litecoin climb to its strongest point since last Friday, when the token was at a peak of $84.92.
 
 
Looking at the chart, one catalyst of the move appears to be the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which broke out of a recent resistance point.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 41.05, following a move beyond the aforementioned ceiling at 40.00.
 
Should momentum continue in this direction, there is a strong chance that LTC bulls will take price to a ceiling at $85.00.
 
 
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
 
In addition to LTC, ethereum classic (ETC) also rebounded from recent lows during Monday’s session.
 
Following a low of $17.05 on Sunday, ETC/USD raced to a peak of $20.20 to start the week.
 
This high has also acted as a point of resistance in recent weeks, and since a collision earlier in the day, bullish momentum has marginally eased.
 
 
At the time of writing, ETC/USD is trading at $19.65, which is still nearly 15% higher than yesterday’s bottom.
 
Overall, it appears that previous bulls have moved to secure gains, as the RSI nears a ceiling of its own at 48.00.
