Seychelles-based exchange Huobi has seen a significant increase in net outflows over the past 24 hours, according to Nansen data.
 
$60.9 million of the $94.2 million in net outflows last week occurred on the last day alone. The top withdrawals are mainly in USDT, USDC, and ETH from wallets with high balances. DefiLlama reports that as recently as December 15, the crypto exchange saw an inflow of $87.9 million. Since then, a total of $204.65 million dollars has flowed out.
 
However, a look at Huobi’s reserves shows that the “calls” for a bank run are very premature. According to Nansen‘s data, the crypto exchange holds $2.8 billio…]]></summary>

A memo obtained by The Information states that HQ Digital is being shut down due to the “general economic environment and the ongoing crypto winter, which is creating significant headwinds for the industry,” and that the company may revisit the project in the future.

Following its request for emergency bailout funding, popular crypto lender Genesis has slashed its staff members and is now considering a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. 
 
This is not the first time Genesis has made it to the headline for possible bankruptcy. Last November, the company voiced its need for an emergency fundraising of $1 billion to bail out its creditors. 
 
Is Genesis Really Going Down?

It’s the latest federal pursuit of crypto rugpullers, an endeavor that is relatively new for federal bodies when it comes to NFTs.
