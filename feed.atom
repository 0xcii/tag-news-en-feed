        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-ton-ada-rebound-from-recent-points-of-support/"/>
        <updated>2023-10-05T15:33:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin rebounded from a three-week low on Thursday, as the cryptocurrency collided with a key support point. The move comes despite the global crypto market mostly consolidating during today’s session. Cardano was another notable mover, rallying away from a support point of its own.
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) moved away from a multi-week low in today’s session, as price climbed above the $2.00 mark.
 
Following a low of $1.95 on Wednesday, TON/USD bulls pushed the token to a peak of $2.10 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the surge, toncoin bounced from its lowest point since September 15, which has also been a key support point.
 
 
Traders opted to buy the dip at this point, with the relative strength index (RSI) rising past a ceiling of 50.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 50.73, with a ceiling of 54.00 a possible target for buyers.
 
Should this point be hit, there is a good chance that TON will hit a ceiling at the $2.20 region in the coming days.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Additionally, cardano (ADA) was a notable gainer, with the cryptocurrency climbing away from a floor of its own.
 
ADA/USD rose to a high of $0.2628 earlier in the day, which comes after a low of $0.255 the day prior.
 
Today’s move saw cardano move away from its recent support point at $0.250, just as the RSI bounced from a floor of its own.
 
 
After colliding with a floor at the 55.00 mark, price strength has gone on to reach a high peak at 58.82.
 
The next visible ceiling looks to be at the 65.00 zone, and in the event bulls manage to reach this point, ADA will likely rise above $0.270.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Altcoins have been thrust into a whirlwind of uncertainty as Bitcoin’s price tries to cling on to its $27k handle. The sudden reversal of the alpha crypto’s fortunes, retreating more than 5% in the last 24 hours, has caught many overzealous traders off guard. As a result, a flurry of liquidations totaling nearly $73 million in the same timeframe has left the crypto landscape reeling.
 
The bulk of these liquidations, a staggering $61.72 million, came from the altcoin arena, where tokens like Aave, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV have taken the brunt of the collapse. Bitcoin longs contributed just $11.28 million to the overall liquidation figure, underscoring the severity of the altcoin market’s downturn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the ongoing criminal case against Sam Bankman-Fried, federal prosecutors have unveiled a forfeiture bill, indicating the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) intent to commandeer two luxury jets belonging to the ex-FTX chief. Specifically, the DOJ has its sights set on a Bombardier Global 5000 BD-700-1A11 and an Embraer Legacy 135BJ.
 
Prosecutors Set Sights on Seizing Bankman-Fried’s Luxury Aircraft
 
On the evening of October 4, the DOJ detailed its plans to seize these high-end aircraft from Bankman-Fried, co-founder and former CEO of FTX. The court order highlighted that these jets are implicated in multiple charges, specifically counts 1-4 and 7, of the federal indictment.
 
 
In addition to the Bombardier and Embraer jets, the DOJ is also keen on acquiring their associated maintenance and engine logs. This development comes on the heels of earlier reports, post-FTX’s downfall, which suggested that Bankman-Fried’s personal aircraft had made multiple trips between the Bahamas and Argentina.
 
 
Contradicting these claims, Bankman-Fried had asserted he never left the Bahamas. Adding another layer to the narrative, there were whispers that FTX’s private jets were repurposed to ferry Amazon packages to top-tier FTX personnel, given Amazon’s refusal to deliver to the Bahamas. In a related twist, Ryan Salame, FTX’s former co-CEO, reportedly had to part with his private jet as a bargaining chip in his plea negotiations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On this day 14 years ago, the Bitcoin price was born. 
As noted in a post on X today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo, October 5 marks the anniversary of the date on which NewLibertyStandard, a pseudonymous early Bitcoin user made public the first U.S. dollar price valuation for Bitcoin.
A home miner at the time, NewLibertyStandard notably used the price of electricity to calculate the exchange rate, factoring how much it cost for him to power his personal computer as he mined coins with little competition.
At the time, he reached the conclusion that 1,309 Bitcoin were worth $1, meaning that a single U.S. dollar could buy the Bitcoin produced by 26 blocks.
The calculation marked the first time that anyone had priced Bitcoin above zero. As noted by Rizzo, Satoshi Nakamoto never priced Bitcoin, nor, as far as we know, offered to buy or sell Bitcoin for dollars.
 
         
         
         
         
    
The date is notable as since then, Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency, has achieved a staggering milestone, with its price soaring by over 3.6 billion percent. 
Fast forward to the present day, and Bitcoin has become a household name, a symbol of financial innovation, and a store of value. It has weathered countless ups and downs, regulatory challenges, and market cycles, emerging as a resilient and highly sought-after asset.
The exponential growth of Bitcoin's price is a testament to its unique features and value propositions. Here are some key factors that have contributed to Bitcoin's remarkable ascent, including its adoption by the market. 
So, while NewLibertyStandard remained only a personal buyer and seller of Bitcoin, he remains one of its founding fathers, helping to create the conditions for later markets to flourish within a global Bitcoin economy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to consolidate on Thursday, ahead of the upcoming U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report in the United States. Payrolls are expected to come in at 170,000 for September, down from 187,000 the month prior. Ethereum fell for a fourth straight day. 
 
Bitcoin
 

 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade close to a key price ceiling on Thursday, ahead of tomorrow’s NFP report.
 

 
BTC/USD peaked at $27,875.59 earlier in the day, which comes following a low of $27,339.27 the day before.
 

 
The move pushed bitcoin closer to a recent resistance level of $27,900, however bulls were unable to capture this point.
 

 

 

 
Earlier gains have since faded, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) encountered some turbulence of its own.
 

 
At the time of writing, the index is at a reading of 60.21, which is marginally below a ceiling at 63.00
 

 
Should this decline continue, price strength could land at a floor of 58.00 in the not-too-distant future.
 

 

 
Ethereum
 

 
Ethereum (ETH) moved lower for a fourth straight session on Thursday, as the cryptocurrency closed in on a recent point of support.
 

 
Following a high of $1,654.43 on Wednesday, ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,632.72 earlier today.
 

 
This extended slippage pushed ethereum towards a floor at $1,620, which was last hit on September 29.
 

 

 

 
Today’s fall in price came as the RSI marginally dropped below a support of its own at the 50.00 zone.
 

 
Currently, the indicator is reading 49.24, with a lower level at 44.00 a possible target for sellers in the market.

During the interview, Hayes discussed several factors contributing to his optimistic Bitcoin price forecast, including Bitcoin's limited supply, the prospect of Bitcoin spot ETFs in major regulated markets, and geo-political uncertainty. 
Hayes further emphasized the fundamental aspect of Bitcoin's fixed supply, capped at 21 million coins. This scarcity, he believes, will drive increased demand as more investors seek to acquire a piece of the limited supply.
