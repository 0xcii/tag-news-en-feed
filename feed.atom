        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a new indictment unsealed on Tuesday, officials charged Sam-Bankman Fried with bribing Chinese officials to release frozen assets.
 
         
         
         
         
    
Federal prosecutors have accused Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), former CEO of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, of attempting to bribe “one or more” Chinese government officials with $40 million, the goal being to release $1 billion worth of frozen digital assets belonging to his hedge fund, Alameda Research. 
Bankman-Fried is already facing eight criminal counts of fraud and conspiracy and has not yet been arraigned on five others. He could face more than 155 years in prison if convicted on all counts — the trial has been scheduled for October.
The new indictment against Bankman-Fried, unsealed by the Southern District Court of New York on Tuesday, alleges that Bankman-Fried devised fraudulent schemes to steal deposits from FTX with the aim of financing risky bets at Alameda Research. In addition, SBF contributed to American politicians without proper documentation, all while living in the Bahamas. FTX’s collapse and subsequent bankruptcy left the industry reeling, as it was once one of the largest and most trusted exchanges.
SBF remains under house arrest at his parents’ home in Palo Alto, California, with restricted movements. Three of his former business partners, including FTX co-founder Gary Wang and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, have already pleaded guilty to their respective charges.
On Tuesday, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan approved a modification to Bankman-Fried’s bail terms to limit his access to the internet. This move followed concerns about his use of a virtual private network, which masks the location of an internet connection. Bankman-Fried will be allowed to use a VPN only to access a database to help prepare his defense, via a laptop provided by his lawyers according to the modification.]]></summary>

The Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) of California revealed on Monday that BlockFi had authorized the distribution of $103,471 in refunds through its servicer to its clients in California.
 
According to the DFPI, BlockFi had failed to promptly notify its customers that they were no longer required to repay loans at the time of the company’s bankruptcy in November.
 
 
This has resulted in California users paying roughly $103,471 to BlockFi’s service provider unnecessarily. DFPI mentioned that, through an investigation, it was found that 111 people in California …]]></summary>

According to a spokesperson for France’s Financial Prosecutor’s Office (PNF), the preliminary investigation into four French banks and one international bank began at the end of 2021.
 
Cum-Ex Scheme at the Center of the Investigation; Societe Generale Confirms Involvement in the Raids
 
Amid the banking crisis plaguing the industry in the United States and abroad, French enforcement authorities on Tuesday raided the offices of several major banks, including HSBC, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas, Natixis, and Exane. The PNF prosecution office noted that the raids were based on suspicion of money laundering and fiscal fraud.
 
“The ongoing operations, which have required several months of preparation, are being carried out by 16 investigating judges and over 150 investigative agents,” the PNF said in a statement. The raids are tied to an alleged dividend arbitrage scheme known as “cum-cum” or “cum-ex” practices. The practice involves splitting dividends temporarily in order to avoid dividend taxes.
 
 
Reportedly, the practice is leveraged by the banks’ wealthy clients to avoid taxation on dividend accounts. The PNF also disclosed that six German prosecutors were involved in the case. The PNF and collaborating prosecutors believe that the alleged fraud has cost governments $108 billion. According to a report by CNBC, Societe Generale was the only financial institution to confirm the office raids. A spokesperson for Societe Generale told The Telegraph that the bank is “part of the investigation.”
