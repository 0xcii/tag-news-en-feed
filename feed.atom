        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano rose for a second straight session to start the weekend, as the token continued to move away from a key price floor. Cryptocurrency markets were marginally higher in today’s session, with the global market up 0.56% as of writing. Solana continued to consolidate on Saturday.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) rose for a second consecutive session, as the token moved away from a recent support point.
 
Following a low of $0.3783 on Friday, ADA/USD jumped to an intraday peak at $0.3902 to start the weekend.
 
As a result of the move, cardano moved further away from a recent floor at $0.3775, following a failed breakout attempt.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that bulls rejected the breakout after the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a floor at 55.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 56.96, with a ceiling at 60.00 a potential target for traders.
 
Should they reach this destination, there is a good chance that ADA will be trading above $0.4000.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
After a volatile week of trading, solana (SOL) entered the weekend marginally higher, however price uncertainty was also high.
 
SOL/USD reached a top at $20.71 to start the weekend, a day after sitting at a low of $20.33.
 
Saturday’s activity sees solana continue to hover close to a long-term floor at $20.15, and this comes following a crossover of moving averages (MA).
 
 
The 10-day (red) MA moved below its 25-day (blue) counterpart earlier in the week, however was unable to extend its distance from this trendline.
 
This comes as the 14-day RSI remains close to a point of support of its own, at the 46.00 mark.
 
Until a breakout of this floor occurs, or there is a move above resistance, it is likely that SOL will continue to trend sideways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was back above $28,000 on Saturday, as markets continued to react to the latest nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report. Figures released on Friday showed that 236,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy last month. Ethereum was also back in the green to start the weekend.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) surged back above the $28,000 level on Saturday, as markets continued to react to the latest NFP report.
 
Payrolls came in at 236,000, which was marginally lower than the 240,000 sum many were anticipating.
 
BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $28,159.86 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $27,824.15.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that the increase in price comes as the relative strength index (RSI) bounced from its floor at 58.00
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 59.07, which has helped delay an inevitable downwards cross with the 10-day (red) moving average and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
BTC is trading at $28,024.28 at the time of writing.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) started today’s session in the green, as prices attempted to move back towards the $1,900 level.
 
Following a low of $1,845.99 on Friday, ETH/USD climbed to a peak of $1,879.11 to start the weekend.
 
The move saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency snap a two-day losing streak, after staying above a floor at $1,830.
 
 
Despite the slight increase in price, ethereum’s price strength remains below a key support point at 61.00.
 
As of writing, the 14-day RSI is tracking at 60.42, and should a breakout occur, there will be a greater chance of price moving above $1,900.
