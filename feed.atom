more often than not during the last 15 years, many investors want to gain  
exposure but doing so can be tricky.
For retail and institutional investors alike, questions of  
regulatory and tax compliance can be puzzling. Then, there’s the challenge of  
learning to navigate a new ecosystem. Using exchanges, sending transactions,

During this time, the number of tokens being burned on a daily basis dropped tremendously, causing the burn rate to suffer.

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Climbs 48,554%
 
According to data from the Shiba Inu burn tracking website, Shibburn, there has been a notable increase in the number of SHIB tokens being sent to the burn address. In the 24-hour period, a total of 87.76 million tokens have been incinerated, leading to a 48,554.74% spike in the burn rate.

JUST IN: Wall Street firms with a combined $15 BILLION in AUM bought exposure to #Bitcoin ETFs in Q1
This is just the beginning 💥 pic.twitter.com/MQ1TZp8tQp
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 11, 2024
  
  
  
Companies that manage over $100 million in assets are required to disclose their equity holdings quarterly through 13F filings. Bitcoin investors have eagerly awaited these filings to see who is buying into the long-awaited Bitcoin ETFs.
The Q1 2024 13F filings released this month provide the first glimpse into institutional spot bitcoin ETF positions. While allocations remain small, the purchases signal growing conviction in Bitcoin's investment merits.
Among the largest buyers, $9.9 billion AUM Park Avenue Securities LLC bought into Grayscale's GBTC, while $1.3 billion Inscription Capital LLC also acquired shares.
Other institutions like American National Bank and Wedmont Private Capital purchased positions in spot bitcoin ETFs. The purchases ranged from a few thousand dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Still, across the board, major wealth managers, family offices, banks, and investment funds are still nibbling on spot bitcoin ETF exposure. This shows that despite Bitcoin's volatility, it is passing institutional due diligence.
Further, the 13F filings provide snapshots in time. Q2 filings will offer further insight when released in August. Wall Street is clearly growing more comfortable with Bitcoin, and this steady adoption by giants could well persist.]]></summary>
