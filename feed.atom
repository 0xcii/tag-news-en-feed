        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nigerian crypto platform Bitmama is reportedly set to acquire the African remittances startup Payday for $1 million. Reports of Payday’s acquisition come almost a year after the startup raised $3 million in a funding round. 
 
Bitmama’s Pivot From Crypto
 
The Nigerian crypto platform Bitmama is set to acquire the cross-border payment startup Payday for a reported sum of $1 million. The acquisition deal, which puts Payday’s value at $30 million, allows Bitmama to broaden its product offering to include cross-border remittances without having to start this service from scratch.
 
According to a Dec. 5 Techcabal report, Bitmama’s yet-to-be-consumated acquisition deal comes nearly a year after the previously high-flying Payday successfully raised $3 million in a funding round. Commenting on the deal, Favour Ori, founder and CEO of Payday, said:
 
“The deal is a work in progress. If the deal goes through, the result will be a strong team with much more efficiency.”
 

 
When the deal is finalized, Bitmama is expected to take over Payday’s customer deposits and the remittance firm’s liabilities.
 
Ruth Iselema, who founded Bitmama in 2019, explained how her platform’s pivot away from its crypto-only approach convinced Ori to approach. She also suggested that Bitmama’s desire to become a leading remittance service provider made the deal to buy Payday even more lucrative.
 
Meanwhile, Payday’s downfall may be linked to the founder’s extravagance and brash management style as well as the company’s failure to effectively deal with customer complaints, according to reports.

93% Of Bitcoin Supply Already Mined
 
The total mined Bitcoin crossed 19 million back in 2022 and the figure has continually risen since then. Then in December 2023, the total percentage of the total BTC supply that has been mined crossed the 93% threshold, and Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, took to Twitter to share this milestone.
 
 
According to data from Blockchain.com, a total of 19,560,877.158 BTC has been mined as of December 5. This means that between April 2022 and December 2023, less than 600 BTC were brought into circul…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain governance changes how decisions are made in decentralized systems. Unlike traditional ways involving discussions off the blockchain, on-chain governance uses the blockchain for decision-making. This process is done through smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements. 
 In on-chain governance, decisions and voting are programmed into smart contracts, making the entire process transparent and recorded on the unchangeable blockchain. This method aligns with decentralization, where power isn't held by a few individuals but distributed among the participants. This decentralization reduces the risks of central control and strengthens the security of blockchain networks. 
 A crucial aspect of on-chain governance is the role of economic incentives. Token holders actively partici…]]></summary>

 Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world with around $9.4 trillion in AUM, doesn’t appear to pull any punches when it comes to speaking his mind.  In 2017, Fink dismissed crypto as an “index of money laundering.” But just three years later the BlackRock CEO admitted that assets like Bitcoin had caught his attention.  
 “I do believe the role of crypto is it’s digitizing gold in many ways,” Fink said in a recent interview with Fox Business, while also referring to BTC as an “international asset.”  Today, BlackRock is geari…]]></summary>

The Spot Bitcoin ETF Factor
 
According to a study conducted by the crypto platform Bybit, the bitcoin held by INS saw an “almost twofold increase in their Bitcoin holding percentage” during the initial three quarters of 2023. The study report suggests that the accumulation trends by these traders depict a pattern which is distinct from that of VIP and retail traders.
 
For context, the BTC holding percentages for the VIP and retail traders at the start of 2023 and the end of Q3 are almost identical. Even after the June BTC…]]></summary>

In the interview, Warren stated that “there is a new threat out there, and it is crypto.” The senator’s assertion is apparently due to the risk of criminal activities that cryptocurrency poses.

Microbt to Integrate Hydro-Cooling Miners
 
Phoenix Group PLC, a bitcoin mining company based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has signed an order worth more than $380 million with Microbt, a mining rig manufacturer. As part of the agreement, Phoenix Group PLC will receive mining equipment valued at $136 million, with an additional option worth $246 million.
 
The UAE-based bitcoin miner is also collaborating with Microbt to integrate hydro-cooling miners, which is a significant milestone towards Phoenix Group’s goal of creating High-Performance Computing (HPC) data centers. Bijan Alizadehfard, the co-founder and CEO of Phoenix Group PLC, described the collaboration with Microbt as a reflection of his company’s strategic foresight.
 
“This collaboration with Whatsminer [Microbt] is a milestone for Phoenix Group, reflecting our strategic foresight and commitment to pioneering in the tech industry. Our successful listing on the ADX has further empowered us to pursue such significant partnerships, enhancing our capabilities in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector,” Alizadehfard said.
 
 
Phoenix Group has announced a multi-million dollar deal with Microbt, coming just days after its highly successful initial public offering (IPO) which raised over $370 million.
 
The oversubscribed IPO and the deal with Microbt both signal a new era of growth and innovation for the UAE company. Phoenix Group PLC aims to leverage these advancements to reinforce its position as a leader in the global technology industry.

This application was previously submitted to the financial market regulator in Abu Dhabi. The decision to retract its bid stems from Binance's ongoing reassessment of its “global licensing needs", according to the company.
Is Binance Rethinking Its MENA Strategy?  

As seen on the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) register, Binance’s local subsidiary, BV Investment Management Limited, applied for the license on 15 November 2022 and withdrew the application on 7 November 2023. The license would have enabled the exchange to offer services to professional clients.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, the founder of Binance, has recently grappled with significant legal hurdles in the U.S. His guilty plea in a notable case led a Seattle federal judge to impose movement restrictions on him.
 
Former Binance Boss CZ Restricted to U.S. Soil
 
As the pivotal figure of Binance, CZ admitted guilt for not establishing anti-money laundering measures and breaching U.S. sanctions. His plea, which included resigning as the CEO, brought considerable repercussions for both him and the crypto exchange firm.
 
U.S. District Judge Richard Jones, on Thursday, reversed a previous ruling that would have permitted Zhao to travel back to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Pointing to Zhao’s substantial assets and weak connections to the U.S., Judge Jones highlighted the flight risk he poses. This decision came after Jones consented to the plea agreement between the U.S. authorities and CZ, amid Binance’s settlement process.
 
Judge Jones expressed that the court wasn’t persuaded by assurances that CZ wouldn’t flee if allowed to go to the UAE, a country with which the U.S. lacks an extradition agreement. Consequently, he ordered CZ to remain within the mainland U.S. until his sentencing in February 2024. CZ could face up to 18 months in prison for these offenses.
 
 
Many speculate that CZ might avoid jail time, akin to Arthur Hayes, the ex-CEO of Bitmex. Hayes received a sentence of six months of house arrest and two years probation for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by not instituting an anti-money laundering (AML) system at Bitmex. Although Hayes faced a potential prison sentence, his guilty plea and the settlement of fines helped him evade incarceration.

This decision overruled Zhao's previous bail agreement that would have allowed him to visit his UAE residency but requires him to return to the US two weeks before his sentencing.  

The ruling came only a day after the court accepted Zhao's guilty plea for violating one count of Bank Secrecy Act violation.  

Bail Agreement Does not Guarantee Free Movement  

Zhao entered the guilty plea last month and consecutively signed a $175 million bond agreement. He already put up about $15 million in an escrow account and found guarantors for the additional funds.
