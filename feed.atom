        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a historically-bad year for bitcoin mining, public companies that fell into penny stock status surged back in January following a strong bitcoin rally.
2022 was arguably the worst year on record for bitcoin mining. Every market suffered from the consequences of unprecedented recklessness by central banks around the world. But because bitcoin is nothing if not volatile — and because mining acts as a leveraged bet on bitcoin itself — the mining sector of the bitcoin economy finished last year battered and bruised. In fact, many public mining companies were relegated to trading as literal penny stocks.
Thanks to an unexpected, wildly-bullish start to the new year, however, investors have seen bitcoin mining stocks roar back to life. No doubt the relief in share prices (and the price of …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu extended recent gains into the weekend, as the meme coin rose to its highest point in four months. Today’s surge saw prices climb by as much as 13%, and comes despite cryptocurrency markets mostly consolidating. Dogecoin also moved higher, breaking out of a recent ceiling in the process.
 
Shiba inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was one of the biggest movers in the market for a second consecutive session, with prices rising by as much as 13% higher today.
 
SHIB/USD rose to a high of$0.00001457 on Saturday, which was its strongest point since October 29.
 
The move comes following a low of $0.00001232 on Friday, and as bulls led a breakout of a price ceiling at $0.00001290.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge also led to a breakout of the relative strength index (RSI), which hit a 12-day high.
 
The index moved beyond a ceiling at 74.00 earlier in the day, and is currently tracking at a reading of 79.15.
 
This is close to a ceiling at 80.00, and has resulted in earlier bulls beginning to abandon previous positions.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) also surged in Saturday’s session, with prices breaking out of a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $0.09107 on Friday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.09489 to start the weekend.
 
As a result of this move, the meme coin once again moved above a ceiling at $0.0935 earlier in the day.
 
 
However, as the session progressed, momentum has since dropped, and this comes as the RSI collided with a hurdle.
 
The index ran into resistance at the 63.00 mark, causing bulls to retreat, in fear of a price reversal.
 
As of writing, price strength is now at 61.92, with DOGE trading at $0.09383.

Bitcoin mostly consolidated however, as traders moved to take recent profits.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved lower to start the weekend, as traders continued to secure gains following a recent climb to a six-month high.
 
Following a high of $23,678.10 on Friday, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $23,279.96 earlier in Saturday’s session.
