However, pro-XRP attorney Jeremy Hogan has pointed out another very interesting development via X.
 
In his latest remarks, Hogan has drawn attention to a strategic precedent that could benefit Ripple, citing the Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. case adjudicated by the US Supreme Court. Hogan noted, “BTW, if you are rooting for Ripple. Throw a big KISS at Changpeng Zhao and Binance for their win last year in the Anderson v.
