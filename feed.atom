        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, are facing yet another class action lawsuit, this time brought by three cryptocurrency investors who allege that the exchange failed to prevent money laundering. The lawsuit was filed last Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, Seattle.
Laundering of Stolen Crypto
The three primary plaintiffs claim that their cryptocurrencies were stolen and subsequently deposited by the thieves on Binance to "remove the connection between the ledger and their digital assets," thereby making the stolen cryptocurrencies untraceable.
The lawsuit alleges that Binance was complicit in the money laundering process, which constitutes a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act.

Crackdown on Crypto ATMs
According to an official statement released yesterday (Tuesday), the German regulator raided 35 locations across the country and seized 13 ATM machines. The agency highlighted that the ATMs were “illegally installed” and not registered under Section 32 of the Banking Act.
The regulator, which oversees the financial market in Germany, also pointed out that the exchange of euros and cryptocurrencies through these ATMs violated the country's existing Banking Act. Additionally, it raised concerns about the risk of money laundering.

Amid this sell-off, Ethereum wasn’t also spared. By August 5, the coin fell to as low as $2,100. Even though prices bounced on the days that followed these losses, the uptrend momentum has been shaky, and there are doubts that buyers will sustain the leg up.

As Bitcoinist reported on Monday, the Democratic Party’s 2024 platform, unveiled at the Democratic National Convention this week, notably omitted any mention of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, or blockchain. 
 
This absence of support has been met with dismay from the crypto community, which had hoped for greater acknowledgment and endorsement from the party now led by Vice President Kamala Harris.
