Bitcoin Whales Seem To Be Going Risk-Off Mode Currently
 
As explained by CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju in a post on X, the BTC whales have appeared to have been shifting towards a risk-off mentality recently.
 
The indicator of interest here is the “Inter-exchange Flow Pulse” (IFP), which keeps track of the Bitcoin flows taking place between spot and derivative exchanges.
 
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that the amount of BTC going from spot to derivative platforms is rising right now. Such a trend can suggest that big players like the whales are showing an interest in opening up higher-risk positions on the derivative exchan…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock and VanEck, among other companies who have  
applied to list spot Bitcoin ETF, have adjusted their submissions following  
comments from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
This unprecedented engagement between the SEC and  
the prospective issuers within a 24-hour cycle indicates a significant push  
toward compliance in the race for regulatory approval, Coindesk reported. 
The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC)  
swift response to their filings has spurred an intense 24-hour cycle of  
amendments, shedding light on the stringent regulatory scrutiny surrounding  
these applications.
Notably, the revisions aim to address shareholder  
protection in case of insolvency and avert conflicts of interest among the  
ETF’s authorized participants.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Although the regulator rejected and delayed its decision for years, this time, the industry is optimistic for approval.
The optimism is directly reflected in the Bitcoin price, which tests the $47,000 level. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at more than $46,700 apiece, gaining above 6.3 percent in the last 24 hours.
According to the popular Fear and Greed Index, the crypto market is facing “Extreme Greed” at the highest level since October 2021.

        <updated>2024-01-09T09:34:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting in June, users of Mercari, one of Japan’s biggest e-commerce platforms, will be able to pay for products using bitcoin. Users of the platform will also be able to use proceeds from sales to buy and sell bitcoin. 
 
Mercari Set to Continue Displaying Yen Prices
 
One of Japan’s biggest online marketplaces, Mercari, has announced that soon its customers will be able to make payments using Bitcoin (BTC). Although Mercari is expected to continue displaying prices in yen, starting in June, its customers will be able to select the crypto asset when making payments.
 
According to a Nikkei report, Melcoin, a subsidiary of the online commerce giant, is set to process all payments made via BTC. This means vendors will only receive their payments in the form of yen. In addition, users will be able to buy and sell BTC using proceeds from online sales.
 
 
Mercari’s pivot to BTC payments comes almost a year after it launched a BTC trading service and more than three months after it reportedly hit the 1 million users milestone. The milestone was achieved as Mercari confirmed that some 80% of its crypto users had no previous crypto trading experience.
 
Despite being the new kid on the block, Mercari’s BTC trading service is already viewed more favorably by Japanese users than its rival Rakuten. As the findings of a study conducted by Mobile Marketing Data Labo show, 24.7% of the respondents who began using crypto in 2023 said they prefer using Mercari, compared to Rakuten’s 24.2%.
 
Meanwhile, some have described Mercari’s BTC trading service as a major blow to centralized crypto exchanges like Bitflyer, which has seen its share of the market drop to 11.3%.
