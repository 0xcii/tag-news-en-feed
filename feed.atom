Bankman-Fried was arrested without any untoward incident.
 
“Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the U.S. government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the southern district of New York,” Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, tweeted, according to Agence France-Presse via The Philippine Star.

SBF Wants to Start a New Business
 
Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), former CEO of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX, was asked in an interview with the BBC, published Saturday, whether he planned to start a new business venture to earn the money to pay FTX investors and customers back. The former FTX boss replied:
 

I would give anything to be able to do that. And I’m going to try if I can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bahamian authorities have arrested Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and ex-CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, after the U.S. filed criminal charges.
Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has been arrested in the Bahamas by local authorities.
The arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the U.S. that it had filed criminal charges against SBF, per a statement from the Attorney General of the Bahamas. SBF’s extradition to the U.S. will likely be requested.
SBF has been on the news for a couple of years, but it wasn’t until recently that such coverage turned a dark corner. The Jane Street alumni turned crypto founder ultimately led his creations, FTX and Alameda Research, to insolvency as SBF’s severe mismanagement of users’ funds came to light. He then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and resigned as CEO.
The disgraced entrepreneur then went on an unusual interview spree, talking about the companies and his version of the story to as many journalists willing to give him a stage. Notably, however, SBF would only deflect from answering the tougher questions, reaching a point where he said he “didn’t knowingly commingle users’ funds.”
Now, the story is set to take a new twist as prosecutors move to unseal the indictment on Tuesday morning. A source familiar with the matter told The New York Times that charges brought against SBF include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.]]></summary>

This is an opinion editorial by Tim Niemeyer, a Bitcoiner since circa 2018 and co-host of the Lincolnland Bitcoin Meetup in Springfield, Illinois.

“I tell the kids, somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose.
Just don't fight about it. Just try to get better.” — Yogi Berra

Let’s pretend we’re playing a game of baseball. Aside from the occasional blind umpire, the rules are pretty fair and consistent. In our particular game though, let’s pretend I’m not only the opposition but also the umpire, rule maker and historian. When you score a run, I can overturn the call.

Bucharest, Romania,12/12/22, Chainwire:
 
After experiencing success in the crypto space, DeFi Yield Protocol announces a complete rebranding to Dypius. The experienced team conducted several months’ worth of research to come up with the best way to represent what they had evolved into over the years. Dypius has the suffix of the nebulae in the galaxy. Nebulas are the formations of gas, dust, and other materials that “clump” together to form denser regions in the universe. They attract further matter and eventually become dense enough to form stars, planets, and planetary system objects. Dypius is the place of creation of stars, planets, and life. This is Dypius, a place to create and shape the future!
