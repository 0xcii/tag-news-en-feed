        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum has started the week below $1,600, as markets appeared to be awaiting the release of several key data points from the United States. After a quiet week, the coming days will see the latest inflation, retail sales, and consumer sentiment figures released. Bitcoin remained lower on Monday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin started yet another week trading under the $26,000 level, as traders began to prepare for upcoming U.S. economic releases.
 
BTC/USD slipped to a low of $25,620.46 earlier in today’s session, after ending the weekend at a peak of $25,978.13.
 
Monday’s decline in price saw bitcoin continue to hover close to a key support point at the $25,600 region.

The slippage comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved closer to a floor of its own at the 35.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 37.09, which comes after failing to break out of a ceiling of 45.00 last week.
 
Should bulls reject a drop below 35.00, there is a good chance that BTC reverses in the coming days.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) edged lower to start the week, with price falling below the $1,600 level on Monday.
 
After peaking at $1,627.67 on Sunday, ETH/USD raced to an intraday low of $1,581.79 during today’s session.
 
This resulted in the world’s second largest cryptocurrency falling to its lowest level since August 22.

The decline arrives as a breakout occurred on a price floor of $1,620, with bears rushing into the market as a result.
 
Price strength is now oversold, and is tracking at 31.27, with the next support point at the 28.00 zone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in a recent interview unveiled his interest in a novel concept within the cryptocurrency sphere, known as “flatcoins.” According to Armstrong, flatcoins represent the next evolution of stablecoins, offering a unique approach to maintaining value stability in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.
 
Flatcoins, as Armstrong explained, are stablecoins that derive their value from a different source compared to traditional stablecoins. Rather than being backed by fiat currency or a basket of assets, flatcoins are pegged to purchasing power or the Consumer Price Index (CPI). 
 
This means that the value of a flatcoin would fluctuate to reflect changes in the cost of goods and services, making it potentially more resilient to inflation and economic fluctuations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nigerian Web3 startup Nestcoin has reportedly secured a total of $1.9 million in funding from both existing and new investors. The capital raised will be used to bolster Nestcoin’s finances and further develop the startup’s non-custodial wallet. 
 
Impact of FTX’s Collapse on Nestcoin
 
The Nigerian Web3 startup Nestcoin recently secured $1.9 million via a strategic funding round which was led by Hashed Emergent, a report has said. Existing investors that participated in the round include Alter Global, Magic Fund, CMT Digital, and 4DX Ventures while Adaverse and Base Ecosystem Fund were the two new investors.
 
The startup’s latest fundraising success came almost a year after it lost access to a stash of stablecoins which were held at the now defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX. As reported by Bitcoin.com News in November 2022, Nestcoin initially responded to the loss of access to digital assets worth millions of dollars by reducing its employee headcount.
 
 
According to a Techcrunch report, the loss of access to funds also forced Nestcoin to re-evaluate its business model. Commenting on what the re-evaluation process has done for the startup, Yele Bademosi, the CEO of Nestcoin, said:
 
“During this transition period, we were trying to make the best decision when there were no good decisions. It helped that we were open and transparent with our investors and community. We had to make tough decisions regarding cutting product lines. We had to transition from a venture studio and investment holding company to a single-product company.”
 
Meanwhile, the report revealed that Nestcoin is planning not only to use the raised funds to bolster its finances but also to develop its non-custodial wallet further.

Chase, one of the largest banks in the United States, is in the early stages of

A spokesperson for Ripple told news outlet The Block, “Conversations accelerated last week following the security incident via a third-party analytics vendor, but this opportunity makes sense for Ripple in the long term.” The spokesperson further clarified that the fintech company, which was already a minority investor in Fortress, had been in discussions about a potential acquisition even before the incident.
