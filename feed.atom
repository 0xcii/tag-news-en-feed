        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that Ethereum transaction fees have been rising again recently. Here’s what could be behind this trend.
 
Ethereum Average Fees Has Registered A Notable Uptick Recently
 
In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment talked about how the Ethereum network has recently become more expensive. The metric of interest here is the “Average Fees,” which keeps track of the average fees that ETH users are currently attaching with their transfers.
 
How much fees senders might be willing to pay comes down to the activity level the blockchain is witnessing. In times of high traffic, transfers can get stuck for a while, as ETH has only a limited capacity to handle transactions. Those looking to beat the crowd, thus, go with a higher-than-average fee.

Lummis Urges Congress To Lead In Crypto Regulation
 
While there has been notable progress, including the approval of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Lummis pointed out that the US still lags behind the European Union’s ineffective regulation.

A CryptoQuant analyst named Mac D recently published insights on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, highlighting the implications of this change.
 
 
Retail Interest Dwindles, What About Smart Money?
 
According to Mac D, the decline in retail investor participation is tied to the negative Korean premium indicator—a sign that local investors are losing interest in the crypto space.
 
 
The primary reason for this downturn, as Mac wrote, is linked to Bitcoin’s sideways price movement over the last six months, following its peak in March.

In a recent report, Thielen outlined several factors that could set the stage for a crypto rally in the last quarter of 2024. According to the report, further upside for the crypto markets could be on the cards due to two key factors.
 
First, the acceleration in stablecoin minting signals rising interest among investors and traders in re-entering the crypto market.

The SEC, however, is apparently not happy with this ruling, especially in light of how it would affect any future regulatory proceedings.
