Kraken Responds to The US SEC

Morgan highlighted that Kraken bases its stance on the claim that the SEC has not been able to develop a direct connection between the issuers of certain coins, which the commission calls “crypto asset securities.”

Bluntz hinted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that WIF’s next move to the upside could be the one that makes its price go “turbo parabolic.” He added that the meme coin would unlikely see any further pullback at the $0.50 resistance. From the accompanying chart the analyst shared, one could see that he was hinting at the meme coin hitting $1 when this parabolic move happened.
