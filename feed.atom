As measured by a seven-day simple moving average (SMA), it has surged to an impressive 455 exahash per second (EH/s). To put that into perspective, the hashrate was hovering around 261 EH/s on January 1, 2023. This translates to a leap of 194 EH/s in less than a year, inching tantalizingly close to half a zettahash.
