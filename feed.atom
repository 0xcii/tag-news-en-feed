        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video gaming industry giant Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, doesn’t hold back in mocking the claim that the metaverse has become extinct.
 
The billionaire behind Unreal Engine and Fortnite, Sweeney came to Twitter on May 9 to mock PR agency CEO Ed Zitron’s article titled, “RIP Metaverse, we hardly knew ye,” which saw print on Insider earlier this week.
 
According to the article, the “once-buzzy technology… died after being abandoned by the business world.” Zitron believes that Horizon Worlds, Meta’s virtual reality platform, hasn’t lived up to its “grand promise” of becoming the internet of the future.
 
Contrary to Zitron’s claims, Sweeney said that 600 million people use virtual worlds like Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, The Sandbox, and VR Chat.

Massa is an innovative blockchain network that aims to combine high performance with true decentralization from the ground up. The Massa testnet allows anyone to experiment with the protocol and witness its continuous improvements first-hand.

DoMI is essentially a 21st-century version of the Declaration of Independence, with 27 reasons listed on why fiat currency is an unfair and broken monetary system controlled by governments that favors the wealthiest and most privileged. The second half of the document lists 29 reasons why Bitcoin is the fairest and most egalitarian monetary system ever conceived and implemented.

"There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>

And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>
