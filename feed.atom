        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a rapidly developing case, three cryptocurrency advocacy groups have filed amicus briefs in support of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, who has been indicted for his role in the creation and operation of the prominent crypto mixer platform. Storm, who has since been apprehended by US authorities, had earlier filed for a motion to dismiss the charges against him, describing them as “fatally flawed.” 
 
The US citizen, who is one of the three Tornado Cash developers, faces three charges from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) alongside Russian counterpart Roman Semenov who is currently on the loose. Meanwhile, Alexey Pertsev, the last Tornado Cash co-founder, is also undergoing trial in the Netherlands for similar reasons, with a court ruling expected on May 14.

The past seven days have been rough for SHIB hodlers, as the meme coin fell to as low as 0.00002584 earlier in the week, representing a price decline of over 15% from $0.00003069. However, it would seem the price decline has created an opportunity for some large investors, known as whales, to buy SHIB at a discount. 
 
 
According to on-chain data, some new SHIB whale accounts amassed 184 billion SHIB, worth approximately $4.9 million in the middle of the week from crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance.
