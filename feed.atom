Developing Economies Neglected by the Global Financial World
 
Tether, the issuer of the stablecoin USDT, has criticized the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) study for singling out the stablecoin’s use in illicit activities.

This delay grants authorities time to extradite Kwon from Montenegro, allowing him to potentially attend the trial for the first time.
 
SEC Seeks Trial Delay Amid Cooperation
 
Just days after a judge firmly rejected motions to reconsider earlier orders, the SEC, in a surprising move, requested a “modest adjournment” to accommodate Kwon’s extradition proceedings. This comes despite previous uncertainty surrounding Do Kwon’s presence, facing criminal charges in the US and South Korea alongside his ongoing detainment in Montenegro.
