        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e749258ba0a</id>
        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/videos/livestream-bitcoin-mining-changes-forever"/>
        <updated>2023-11-28T15:01:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ocean, a stealth Bitcoin startup, is hosting a one-day event today in South Carolina where it will unveil new technology aimed at decentralizing Bitcoin mining.
The one-day event will bring together a host of industry leaders to discuss the topic, including Block CEO Jack Dorsey, long-time Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr, and others. The event is being hosted by a local Bitcoin mining facility.
The topic is of note given that mining has become a heavily centralized industry in recent years, not necessarily due to the ownership of actual mining hardware being concentrated, but because of the central dependency on large mining pools to actually coordinate with other miners. 
This presents a problem on multiple fronts. Pools custodying miners funds gives them the ability to withhold payments and coerce actual miners to behave or act a certain way. The two largest pools require KYC information before allowing someone to mine with them. Large pools can actively censor transactions if they choose, or were mandated to by governments, using the hashrate of their customers. 
Pools are a necessary piece of the Bitcoin network, as without them the only option is solo mining. This means very infrequent and random payouts that are highly unpredictable and make planning a high capital business very risky. 
Still, Dorsey's attention to the topic, while notable, is not new. As recently as April, Dorsey has hinted that Block was turning its attention to Bitcoin mining, purchasing Bitcoin mining chips as it sought its own entrance into the sector. Dorsey has been public about his interest in the issue since as far back as 2021.
It remains to be seen what solution Ocean will unveil, whether Block will be involved, or if Dorsey or Dashjr will have any specific role at the startup.
For more details, Ocean's livestream begins at 10:30 am EST and will be live on Bitcoin Magazine's X, Rumble, and YouTube channels.]]></summary>

This presents a problem on multiple fronts. Pools custodying miners funds gives them the ability to withhold payments and coerce actual miners to behave or act a certain way. The two largest pools require KYC information before allowing someone to mine with them. Large pools can actively censor transactions if they choose, or were mandated to by governments, using the hashrate of their customers. 
Pools are a necessary piece of the Bitcoin network, as without them the only option is solo mining. This means very infrequent and random payouts that are highly unpredictable and make planning a high capital business very risky. We need them, in one form or the other, but the current form pools are taking present a growing systemic risk to the success of Bitcoin. They are starting to present threats to the core property that makes Bitcoin such a valuable and desirable system in the first place: it's censorship resistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Singapore-based payment gateway Alchemy Pay has been granted the money services license by the U.S. state of Iowa. Both this license and the money transmitter license obtained from Arkansas nearly two months earlier underline Alchemy’s “dedication to compliance.”
 
Alchemy Now in the Same League as Established Payment Providers
 
Alchemy Pay, a crypto on-ramp and payment gateway, recently said it has been granted the money services license by the U.S. state of Iowa’s banking division. In a statement, the Singapore-based payment gateway said it secured the Iowa license just a few months after obtaining the money transmitter license (MTL) in the state of Arkansas.
 
According to the gateway’s Nov. 23 statement, obtaining both licenses puts Alchemy in the same league with key players in the U.S. crypto market such as Coinbase, X (formerly Twitter), and Moonpay. Robert McCracken, the ecosystem lead at Alchemy, said the license acquisitions demonstrate his firm’s desire to remain compliant whilst improving user experience.
 
“The acquisition of our second Money Services License in the United States underlines Alchemy Pay’s global payment capabilities and our dedication to compliance. We continue to obtain licenses in countries and regions around the globe, improving our user’s experience, and strengthening our network coverage,” McCracken said.
 
 
In addition to the two licenses, the payment provider said it has completed the application process for MTL licenses in more states with outcomes expected to come in the next few months.
 
Besides the United States, Alchemy has scored similar license successes in Lithuania, Indonesia, and Canada. Alchemy Pay said it also intends to secure licenses in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. These licenses not only solidify Alchemy’s standing in the crypto payment sector but also extend its credibility into the traditional payment sector.
