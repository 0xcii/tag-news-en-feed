        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicted that Dogecoin (DOGE) could soon enjoy a 100% price gain. He also elaborated on what needs to happen for the foremost meme coin to enjoy such a parabolic move.

Martinez explained in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin is currently encountering significant resistance between $0.166 and $0.171, a range where 75,500 addresses have acquired almost 10 billion DOGE tokens. The analyst claimed that Dogecoin’s price could double if it breaks out from this range, with $0.322 being the next “key resistance” for DOGE.
