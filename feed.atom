        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Monday, USDT issuer Tether announced the freezing of 32 crypto wallet addresses. These addresses together hold $873,118 and are believed to be associated with activities related to “terrorism and warfare” in Ukraine and Israel.
 
The freezing of these crypto wallet addresses underscores the growing importance of regulatory compliance and security in the cryptocurrency space.
 
Stablecoin issuers, in particular, are facing increasing pressure from governments and financial institutions to ensure that their digital assets are not used for illegal or harmful purposes.
 
This move also highlights the need for enhanced due diligence and monitoring of crypto transactions, as it can help detect and prevent potential misuse of digital currencies for nefarious activities.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a Consumer Alert on Thursday warning that crypto assets are not FDIC-insured. The FDIC is an independent federal agency that provides insurance for bank deposits held by member institutions of up to $250,000 per depositor.
 
“If your bank is FDIC insured, you’re protected up to $250,000 if the bank fails,” FTC’s Consumer Education Specialist Cristina Miranda explained. In contrast, she stressed:
 

The funds you deposit with a crypto-based financial services provider … That money isn’t FDIC insured or protected if the crypto company goes under.
 
She then brought up Voyager Digital LLC, a crypto-based financial services provider, stating that the company “misled people with claims that money deposited through a ‘Voyager App’ was FDIC insured if anything went wrong.”
 
Miranda clarified: “Despite its claims, Voyager was never an FDIC insured bank. And FDIC insurance doesn’t cover crypto (also called crypto assets.) So, when Voyager eventually failed and filed for bankruptcy, people with accounts were locked out and lost money.”
 
 
Voyager and its affiliated companies have agreed to be permanently banned from offering, marketing, or promoting any products or services that could be used to deposit, exchange, invest, or withdraw any assets, the FTC explained. The government agency advised:
 

Know that crypto deposits are not FDIC insured, period. If something happens, the government may not have an obligation to step in and help get your money back.

According to a Bloomberg report, the move comes after the termination of a partnership with a third-party firm responsible for approving communications on the exchange, as mandated by the UK’s financial watchdog.
 
UK Users Blocked
 
Effective from 5 p.m. London time on Monday, October 16, individuals in the UK who have not yet registered with Binance will no longer be able to create new accounts, according to an official blog post by the exchange.
