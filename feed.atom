        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP extended a recent bull run on Friday, as the token moved to its highest point in the past two weeks. Today’s move came as the cryptocurrency marginally broke past a key resistance level. Solana was also in the green, as price rose for a fourth straight day, nearing the $20.00 mark in the process.
 
XRP
 
XRP was a notable gainer on Friday, as the cryptocurrency climbed higher for a fourth straight session.
 
XRP/USD peaked at a high of $0.5051 earlier in the day, which comes a day after trading at a low of $0.4824.
 
As a result of today’s gains, XRP, formerly ripple, rose to its highest point since September 1, when price traded at a high of $0.5115.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move occurred after the token broke out of a resistance level at $0.4920.
 
This took place as the relative strength index (RSI) briefly escaped a ceiling of its own around the 38.00 mark.
 
Price strength now sits at 38.42, with the next visible point of resistance at 42.00.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) maintained a bull run of its own today, as it too rose higher for a fourth consecutive day.
 
Following a low of $18.77 on Thursday, SOL/USD edged to a high of $19.26 earlier in today’s session.
 
The rally saw solana once again break out of a ceiling at $19.20, however like yesterday bulls were unable to maintain this move.
 
 
At the time of writing, SOL has since edged lower, and is now trading at $18.95, with the RSI hovering near a hurdle of its own.
 
The index is now tracking at 41.98, which is just below the aforementioned resistance level of 42.00.
 
In order to push towards $20.00, solana bulls need to force a breakout in the coming days.

The SEC’s court filing dated Sept. 14 emphasized Binance US’s holding company, BAM, producing only 220 documents throughout the discovery phase. Many of these were described as “unintelligible screenshots and documents without dates or signatures.”

On the social media platform X, Taleb minced no words, lambasting what he termed “bitdiots” – individuals who believe that the mere scarcity of an asset automatically makes it a sound investment. 
 
According to Taleb, the fundamental confusion lies in equating “necessary” with “sufficient.” In his view, there are countless items with restricted supplies that hold little to no value in the market. He humorously pointed out examples such as “pebbles from Skorpios, und…]]></summary>
