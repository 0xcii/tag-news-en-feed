        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana was up by as much as 15% on Tuesday, as momentum in cryptocurrency markets shifted higher. The global crypto market cap is up by 4.42% at the time of writing. Litecoin was another notable mover, as the token rose to a five-week high.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rose by as much as 15% in today’s session, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets.
 
Following a low of $20.18 to start the week, SOL/USD rose to a peak of $23.20 on Tuesday.
 
As a result of today’s move, solana rose to its strongest point since March 20, when the token was at a high of $23.99.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that today’s move coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moving beyond a ceiling at 58.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 63.74, which is marginally below a higher resistance level of 64.00.
 
Should solana bulls take the RSI beyond this point, then there is a good chance that price could move above $24.00.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
In addition to SOL, litecoin (LTC) was another notable gainer on Tuesday, as the token moved to a multi-week high.
 
LTC/USD jumped to a high of $96.89 earlier in today’s session, which comes after trading at a bottom of $92.37 on Monday.
 
Tuesday’s surge saw litecoin climb to its highest level since March 2, when LTC was trading at $98.34.
 
 
Looking at the chart, prices briefly rose above a key resistance level of $95.50, however as the session has progressed, these gains have been lost.
 
At the time of writing, LTC is trading at $95.41, which remains 2.61% higher than Monday’s low.

Bitcoin Whales Have Made Large Exchange Outflows Today
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, 11 large BTC outflows were made from exchanges today. The relevant indicator here is the “exchange flow balance,” which measures the net amount of Bitcoin entering or exiting the wallets of all centralized exchanges.

Swiss-based non-custodial bitcoin-exchange Pocket Bitcoin has acquired popular bitcoin wallet app Bitkipi, the company announced on Monday. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the acquisition will help Pocket Bitcoin solidify its focus on self-custody and provide users with a platform for buying and holding bitcoin in their own wallets. Previously, customers could set up Pocket with their own existing wallets via the company’s website and stack bitcoin using simple bank transfers.
"We believe that everyone should have access to the financial freedom that bitcoin provides, and the Bitkipi app will be instrumental in helping us achieve that goal," said David Knezić, CEO and co-founder of Pocket Bitcoin. “With this acquisition, Pocket Bitcoin now has an in-house wallet app that enables beginners to easily get started with bitcoin and self-custody,” the press release describes.
Bitkipi's founder expressed excitement to join forces with Pocket Bitcoin and bring their vision to life. "We have been working hard to create an easy-to-use, secure, and reliable bitcoin-only wallet app that can help newcomers get started with bitcoin," said the founder of Bitkipi. The app will continue to be available on both the App Store and Google Play, and current users can expect to see continued updates.
According to the press release, in almost two years, PocketBitcoin has already exchanged over ~$54 million (€50 million) in bitcoin for customers from all over Europe and paid them out on self-custodial wallets.
