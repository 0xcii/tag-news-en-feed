We live in a highly digitalized world, but most of humanity still uses physical goods to store value. The most used store of value in the world is real estate. It is estimated that approximately 67% of global wealth is held in property.

The “Percent Supply in Profit” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total percentage of the Bitcoin supply carrying some unrealized gain.
