        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain data from Glassnode suggests that 83.7% of the Bitcoin short-term holder supply is currently being held at an unrealized loss.
 
Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Supply Has Plummeted Into Losses
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, only 16.3% of the short-term holder supply is in profit right now. The relevant indicator here is the “percent supply in profit,” which measures the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply carrying some gains.
 
This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved/transferred at. If this previous selling price was less than the current spot price, then that particular coin currently carries a profit.
 
The counterpart indicator to the supply in profit is the “suppl…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-13T00:10:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has warned that it is “a huge mistake” to think that the U.S. economy will boom “for years” given that there are so many risks out there. The executive stressed: “I just think people make a mistake to look at real-time numbers and not look at the future. And the future has quantitative tightening. We’ve been spending money like drunken sailors around the world.”
 
Jamie Dimon’s Economic Warning
 
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned about where the U.S. economy is headed at the Barclays 21st Annual Global Financial Services Conference in New York on Monday.
 
The executive cautioned: “I just think people make a mistake to look at real-time numbers and not look at the future. And the future has quantitative tightening. We’ve been spending money like drunken sailors around the world, this war in Ukraine is still going on.” Dimon emphasized:
 

To say the consumer is strong today, meaning you are going to have a booming environment for years, is a huge mistake.
 
“If and when you have a recession, which you’re eventually going to have, you’ll have a normal credit cycle, which I think is quite predictable. In a normal credit cycle, something always does worse than normal,” he described.
 
The JPMorgan boss opined: “There’s a lot of fiscal stimulus taking place out there. And the large one from Covid is still running through. The largest QE is still running through. So we’re still living on that, and that’s really strong. And of course, that drives everything, including business results.”
 
 
Dimon further explained that “businesses feel pretty good because they look at their current results” and see that “they’re not so bad.” However, he cautioned:
 

But those things change. And we don’t know what the full effect of all these things are going to be 12 or 18 months from now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its launch earlier this year, the price of Arbitrum (ARB) has struggled tremendously. The altcoin launched into a budding bear market and as the bears have assumed more control, the ARB token price has dumped even further. This constant decline in price has led to high volumes of panic-selling, and it seems the whales have joined the bandwagon as well.
 
Whales Sell Dump ARB Despite Losses
 
As ARB’s price has continued on a downward trajectory, whales have been selling their holdings into the blood. A report from on-chain tracker Lookonchain shows that some of the largest whales have been selling millions of ARB despite losing millions of dollars in the process.
 
 
Lookonchain first flagged a transaction from Wintermute Trading after it sent 4.35 million tokens worth $3.36 million …]]></summary>

The core of his argument rests on the timeline of his resignation from the firm and the subsequent charges by the FTC.
 
 
Why Mashinsky Seeks Dismissal
 
In a recent court filing, Mashinsky’s legal team argued that the FTC’s case against their client should be dismissed. The legal defense bases its argument on the assertion that the regulatory body cannot “substantiate a claim that Mashinsky ‘is violating’ or is ‘about to violate’ the law.” 
 
This is primarily because he relinquished his position as the CEO of Celsius on September 27, 2023. Such nuances in legal p…]]></summary>

The strategic vision of its founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, combined with the country's commitment to a robust business environment, education, and stringent anti-corruption measures, all contributed to this remarkable transition.
El Salvador, a country currently grappling with significant political and economic changes, is arguably on a parallel course.

For example, WBTC is an Ethereum-based token fully backed by bitcoin held in Bitgo’s custody. Wrapped crypto assets allow users to access and utilize cryptocurrencies across different blockchains while still benefiting from the security and liquidity of the underlying asset.

This downturn has had a domino effect, causing a sharp drop in the prices of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization at the beginning of the week. 
 
According to a Blockworks report, average daily volumes on centralized exchanges tumbled to $8.4 billion in August, marking a 16% decrease from the prior month and a staggering 78% decline year over year.

        <updated>2023-09-12T19:09:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the “Avalon Bitcoin & Crypto Day” conference in Singapore, the bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) manufacturer Canaan showcased its new Avalon-made 14 series mining rigs. One of the mining machines, the A1466I, boasts an energy efficiency of fewer than 20 joules per terahash (J/T), approximately 19.5 J/T, and has a production capacity of up to 170 terahash per second (TH/s).
 
Canaan’s Liquid-Cooled A1466I: A Game-Changer in Bitcoin Mining Efficiency
 
Canaan has officially unveiled its new Avalon series 14 miners after previously teasing the products last month. One of these miners features an efficiency rating below 20 J/T and offers an energy efficiency ratio of 19.5 J/T. This specific mining rig is the A1466I, which utilizes liquid cooling and produces up to 170 TH/s in terms of SHA256 hashrate output.
 
During the Canaan presentation at the event, the company highlighted the availability of two cooling options: submerged liquid-cooled and air-cooled models. The other Avalon 14 series miner, the A1466, is air-cooled and boasts a hashrate of 150 TH/s with an energy efficiency ratio of 21.5 J/T. The Vice President of Canaan, Davis Hui, delivered the presentation onstage, marking Canaan’s 10th anniversary.
 
It’s noteworthy that Avalon-brand miners crafted by Canaan were the first ASIC bitcoin miners to be publicly sold in January 2013. However, while Canaan is the pioneer in introducing a machine with an efficiency rating below 20 J/T, its competitor Bitmain plans to launch its Antminer S21 line at the 2023 World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) in Hong Kong from September 22 to 23. According to Bitmain, the S21 will also feature an efficiency rating of 1X J/T.
