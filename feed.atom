The majority of these tokens are said to be primarily held in cold wallets controlled by the Justice Department, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), or another government agency.

crypto assets worth $150 million in Solana's SOL and Ether (ETH). Blockchain  
addresses connected to the crypto exchange show that over 5.5 million SOL,  
valued at $122 million, and over 24,000 ETH, worth $30 million, have been  
staked, Coindesk reported.  
Staking involves locking up cryptocurrencies on a

receive token rewards. This move by FTX is expected to yield a return as the  
crypto exchange's Founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), faces trial.

This unique trend, as outlined in the report, has positioned the region as a significant player in the global crypto economy, despite its relatively lower ranking compared to regions like the Middle East and North America (MENA), Eastern Asia, and Eastern Europe.
 
The report underscored that Latin America exhibited the highest inclination toward centralized exchanges when compared to other regions. While highlighting this preference, the report also pointed out the region’s deviation from extensive institutional activity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin surged towards $28,000 on Monday, as markets continued to react to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision not to appeal the Grayscale ruling. The decision now means that Graycale could soon move to convert its bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Ethereum edged closer to $1,600 today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was on the cusp of breaking into the $28,000 level on Monday, as markets reacted to the SEC’s decision not to appeal a court ruling favoring Grayscale.
 
BTC/USD surged to a peak at $27,968.93 earlier in today’s session, which comes following Sunday’s low at $26,817.89.
 
As a result of today’s move, bitcoin climbed to its strongest point since October 9, recovering all of last week’s losses in the process.

Earlier gains have since faded, with the relative strength index (RSI) failing to move beyond a resistance level of 60.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 58.98, with bitcoin hovering around the $27,800 mark.
 
Traders will likely make further strides towards $28,000 in the coming hours, and as the week progresses.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also in the green to start the week, as price rose for a fourth straight session.
 
Following Sunday’s bottom at $1,550.88, ETH/USD raced to a peak of $1,588.45 earlier in the day.
 
The current bull run started after traders rejected a breakout below a support level of $1,540, and instead moved towards a ceiling at $1,590.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Bulls will possibly look to break this ceiling as the session progresses, however to do so an upcoming ceiling of 48.00 on the RSI will need to go.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 46.18, which is marginally below the aforementioned resistance level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[El Salvador's Vice President, Félix Ulloa, has expressed his belief that Bitcoin's adoption is playing a pivotal role in the country's economic and political resurgence.
In a new interview with Forbes, Vice President Ulloa described it as a driving force behind a transformation that is fueling tourism, investment, and economic growth.
Ulloa stated, "Without a doubt, tourism and the use of digital currencies go hand in hand and are a sign of that future and the rebirth of our country."
He went on to emphasize that Bitcoin's adoption has facilitated an open and borderless financial system, unlocking new opportunities for Salvadorans and the nation as a whole that have outweighed an increase in international criticism. 
"There were reactions in both directions. Some multilateral organizations initially made objections. Still, the enthusiasm that started in the sphere of the digital economy, with bitcoiners, where El Salvador, having positioned itself as the first country to adopt a cryptocurrency as legal tender, was at the forefront and attracted many investors who are in fact installed in Salvador," he explained.
El Salvador's journey into the world of Bitcoin gained significant attention when it became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021. This historic move, driven by President Nayib Bukele, enabled citizens to transact in Bitcoin, fostering financial inclusion and providing access to a global financial ecosystem.
The combination of financial inclusion, tourism growth, and increased investment demonstrates the potential of cryptocurrency to stimulate economic development and inspire other nations to explore innovative approaches to their economic and financial systems.]]></summary>
