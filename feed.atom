Below is an exact reproduction of the letter we have submitted to Treasury and FinCEN as part of the public request for comment period.
We wish to thank Rafael Yakobi and the team he assembled to draft this response on behalf of Samourai and our users: Carla Reyes, Sasha Hodder, JW Verret, among others who worked diligently behind the scenes for months preparing this submission because they believe thi…]]></summary>

In response, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot provided a speculative timeline for when this could happen and factors that could influence a rise to this price level.

Google’s AI Bard predicts that SHIB could hit $1 in a decade or more as this is more within the realm of possibility, although it is not guaranteed. Meanwhile, the AI seemed less optimistic about the meme coin hitting this price level in the short term, as it says that it is highly improbable considering the massive price jump required.
 
 
Bard also predicts that SHIB’s price will rise significantly within the next few years, although it might not reach the $1 price level by then. Th…]]></summary>
