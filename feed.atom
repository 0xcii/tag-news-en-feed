The “strategic move” of its flagship product to Cboe aims to deepen the firm’s reach around the Asia-Pacific region.
 
 
A Change of Plans: From ASX To Cboe
 
In July 2023, the Australian asset manager firm Monochrome re-filed for its Monochrome Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) amid growing interest in the products. Around the same time, its counterparts in the US were submitting their applications to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
The re-filing came after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) regulatory framework was updated to allow crypto-asset exchange-traded products.
 
Today, Monochrome announced its “strategic …]]></summary>

Bitcoin Total Transfer Volume Has So Far Hit A High Of Just $118 Billion
 
As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the total transfer volume of this bull run hasn’t been able to reach anywhere near the peak of the previous one.
 
The “total transfer volume” here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin that’s becoming involved in transactions on the network every day. The metric is measured in terms of the US Dollar (USD).
 
 
Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in this indicator over the last couple of cycles:

Ninety-one years ago today, President Franklin D. Roosevelt pulled off the greatest heist in American history.
Unlike most robberies, this one was entirely legal. No safe-cracking was required; no ski masks, guns, or getaway cars. Just a pen and some White House letterhead.
On April 5 1933, FDR issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for anyone in the United States to own gold. By penalty of up to a $10,000 fine or 10 years in prison, everyone in the country was ordered to turn in their gold to the government, by the end of the month.1
EO 6102 is one of the most important milestones in the history of money. Book-ended by the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, it was a pivotal part of the process by which the USA aba…]]></summary>

JUST IN:  🇦🇺 The first #Bitcoin spot ETF in Australia to go live "in 2024," asset manager Monochrome says.
It would be the first Australian ETF to hold $BTC directly. pic.twitter.com/x8nYRNzZra
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 5, 2024
  
  
  
Monochrome filed an application with securities exchange Cboe Australia to list its flagship bitcoin ETF product. The firm expects approval by mid-2024.
Unlike previous bitcoin exchange-traded products in Australia, Monochrome's ETF would hold actual bitcoin. This structure mirrors the highly successful spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has already greenlighted Monochrome's proposal. Cboe Australia is now reviewing the application.
"We anticipate a decision from Cboe Australia about the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF before the middle of 2024," said CEO Jeff Yew. "The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF stands to be the first Bitcoin ETF in Australia authorized to hold Bitcoin directly."
If approved, the ETF would provide local investors with direct exposure to bitcoin through a regulated investment vehicle. Monochrome said it chose Cboe for its strategic expertise and extensive reach across Asia.
The firm had originally planned to list on rival exchange ASX, but it has since pivoted to Cboe's platform.
Australia joining the spot bitcoin ETF movement could further validate Bitcoin as an investable asset class, as Monochrome is aiming to tap surging institutional demand as the Bitcoin industry matures.
The fund's launch would arrive just before Bitcoin's next halving event, likely boosting interest. As the first to hold physical bitcoin, Monochrome could quickly dominate the local ETF space in Australia.]]></summary>
