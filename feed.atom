        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto.com, a global crypto exchange, recently postponed its much-anticipated retail market expansion in South Korea, originally scheduled for April 29.
 
This strategic decision came just six days before the planned launch, and according to the report, this delay is due to the company’s need for more comprehensive engagement with local regulatory bodies.
 
 
Regulatory Hurdles And Strategic Responses
 
Notably, the report suggests that the delay allows Crypto.com to further “refine its approach” and ensure its operations align with South Korea’s regulations, particularly concerning anti-money laundering efforts.
 
According to a company statement, this period will be used to “enhance” Korean regulators’ understanding of the exchange’s policies, systems, and controls designed to build a re…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin could be heading toward an imminent sell-off that could tank its price as a significant tranche of coins is about to move into profit. In such a case, it would not be out of the ordinary to see a large number of investors sell off their holdings as they move to secure some profit.
 
10 Billion DOGE Headed For Profit
 
In an interesting twist, the Dogecoin price crossing $0.17 could be both good and bad for the price. This is because a large number of DOGE coins were bought between the $0.15 and $0.168 levels, meaning that a cross above $0.17 would put all of these coins in profit.
 
 
According to data from IntoTheBlock, there are approximately 10 billion DOGE coins that are sitting in this level waiting to move up into profit. At current prices, it means that more than $1.58 bill…]]></summary>
