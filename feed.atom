BTC Drop Purging Speculators, Markets Shifting To Spot Trading
 
Amid the fear gripping the market following this wave of liquidation, one analyst took to X, saying the collapse of bulls this week was necessary. According to Ki Young Ju, the founder of CryptoQuant, a crypto analytics platform, the Bitcoin market has been futures-driven for “a long time.” 
 
 
Though the degree has been falling from the previous bull run in 2024, Ju thinks the crash was necessary to flush the BTC market from leveraged speculators looking to profit from market volatility and not utilize the solution the network presents.

Despite expectations of a post-Halving rally, BTC has struggled to gain momentum since April, facing various factors such as sales of seized assets by US and German authorities and the overhang of $9 billion in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) sales from the defunct Japanese exchange Mt Gox. 
 
However, market participants are increasingly discussing the possibility of a “Trump trade” that could boost the Bitcoin price in the second half of the year.
