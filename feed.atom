        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first week of September, an outflow of $59 million worth of digital assets managed by Digital Asset Funds was recorded, the latest Coinshares data has shown. The latest outflow means the value of digital asset investment products under management has dropped by a total of $294 million or 0.9% in the past four weeks. The Coinshares data shows bitcoin (BTC) as the digital asset which had the highest net outflow ($69 million) in the first week of September.
 
Bitcoin Short Inflows the Largest Since March
 
During the first week of September, digital asset investment products saw a net outflow of $59 million in assets under management (AUM), the latest data from the alternative asset manager Coinshare analysis has shown. According to the asset manager’s blog, the latest net outflow figure brings the value of total outflows in the past four weeks to $294 million, or 0.9% of total AUM.
 

 
As explained in the blog, inflows were also seen in short investment products and this may be an indication that the sentiment for digital assets remains poor. Concerns over the regulation of this asset class and the strengthening dollar are cited as some of the reasons why investors are less keen on investing in digital assets.
 
 
In terms of flows by asset, the Coinshares data shows bitcoin (BTC) as the digital asset that had the highest net outflow ($69 million) in the first week of September. On the other hand, short bitcoin net inflows during the same period topped $15 million, the largest since March 2023.
 
Meanwhile, Ethereum’s net outflow of $4.8 million during the same period saw its year-to-date outflows rise to US$108m representing 1.6% of the total AUM of $6.9 billion. Out of all the digital assets tracked by Coinshares, only XRP and other unidentified digital assets are shown to have recorded positive inflows of $0.7 million and $0.4 million respectively.

temporarily halt certain clients in the UK from making cryptocurrency

into effect.
The United Kingdom's FCA  
is planning to implement a series of rules that will significantly impact the  
way cryptocurrency is marketed and promoted within the country. These rules

In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shared an infographic that looks into the underlying metrics of the different memecoins in the sector.
 
The firm has compared these assets based on two indicators: the holders in profit and the whale concentration. The former tells us about the total percentage of the investors of assets currently sitting in the green.

Bitcoin Lightning, A Solution For Today’s Payment Problems?
 
In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, the former Facebook and PayPal executive spoke about his new project, Lightspak. This company was created to provide payments settled on Bitcoin’s second-layer solution, the Lightning Network.
 
This payment solution improves the Bitcoin network scalability by allowing users to send money “off-chain.” In that sense, Marcus and his company want to turn the cryptocurrency into a “ real global payment network.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FTX estate, currently overseeing the bankruptcy and restructuring of the once-active crypto exchange, reveals holdings of $1.16 billion in solana (SOL) and $560 million in bitcoin (BTC).
 
16% of Solana’s Market Cap Is Held by FTX
 
In a recent Monday court filing, a stakeholder update showcases the premier digital assets held by the estate. As of August 31, 2023, these liquid tokens have a combined value of $3.4 billion. Additionally, the update showcases nearly $200 million in Bahamian real estate. Solana (SOL) emerges as the dominant asset in FTX’s portfolio.
 
 
As of September 11, 2023, with SOL’s market cap standing at $7.24 billion, FTX’s slice is a significant 16%, equating to $1.16 billion. FTX’s diverse crypto portfolio also includes $560 million in BTC, $192 million in ETH, $137 million in APT, $120 million in USDT, $119 million in XRP, $49 million in BIT, $46 million in STG, $41 million in WBTC, and $37 million in WETH. Furthermore, FTX possesses over $529 million in securities housed in Debtor brokerage accounts, of which $417 million resides in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).
 
 
Apart from that, a modest $0.1 million is placed in Blackrock equity under FTX’s control. Delving into FTX’s venture collection, it boasts 438 investments, amassing $4.5 billion in funded assets. Notably, it includes a significant stake in Anthropic, a rival to Openai and the brains behind the generative AI chatbot, Claude. It’s worth mentioning that FTX also owns over 1,000 illiquid crypto assets, which may not realize their full potential value.

One way to track the behavior of these retail holders is through the shrimp “net position change,” which measures the monthly increases or decreases that are taking place in the combined supply of this cohort.

        <updated>2023-09-11T19:05:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent appearance on Fox Business, Anthony "Pomp" Pompliano suggested that a significant Bitcoin bull run is on the horizon. Pompliano, a well-known figure in the Bitcoin space, shared his insights on the future of Bitcoin and why he believes it is primed for another surge.
Pompliano began the discussion by highlighting the recent volatility in the market, with Bitcoin experiencing a period of fluctuation in recent months. However, he emphasized that this is not unusual for the market and is part of the asset class's nature. Pompliano stated that such volatility should not deter investors from considering Bitcoin as a long-term investment.
One of the key factors driving Pompliano's optimism is the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. This year, numerous prominent companies, including BlackRock and Fidelity, filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC, signaling a shift in the perception of Bitcoin from a speculative asset to a legit store of value. Pompliano believes a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved by the end of this year, while more institutions also recognize the value of holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.
Pompliano also discussed the potential for Bitcoin to disrupt traditional financial institutions. He argued that Bitcoin's decentralized nature and borderless accessibility could challenge the dominance of central banks and traditional financial intermediaries. While acknowledging the regulatory challenges that Bitcoin faces, Pompliano believes that innovation will ultimately prevail and that Bitcoin will play a significant role in the future of finance.
Anthony Pompliano's optimism about a forthcoming Bitcoin bull run is rooted in the growing institutional adoption, international recognition, and the potential for Bitcoin to reshape the financial landscape. As Bitcoin continues to evolve and mature, it remains a topic of great interest and debate among investors and financial experts alike.]]></summary>
