        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After dipping below $38,000 earlier this week, Bitcoin has staged a mini-comeback, currently trading around $40,100. This flicker of green has ignited contrasting viewpoints from market watchers, including CNBC’s Jim Cramer, whose recent advice has raised eyebrows.
 
Cramer, known for his sometimes contrarian takes, has taken a cautious stance on Bitcoin’s recent rally. While acknowledging the positive momentum, he expressed concerns about the cryptocurrency’s ability to sustain this upward climb due to potential lack of fresh capital entering the market.

Concerns over Crypto Staking Programs
The SFC, responsible for overseeing financial

staking programs. According to the watchdog, neither "Floki Staking
