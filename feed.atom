#Polygon has built a massive support level!
 
On-chain data reveals that 49,500 addresses purchased 4.65 billion $MATIC between $0.94 and $1.11. This important demand wall may have the strength to keep #MATIC at bay in the event of a correction and serve as a rebound point. pic.twitter.com/cFp1ASnRmB

For some firms, their rigs could not cover their loan collaterals. So it’s not surprising that mining firms might feel the impact of last year’s revenue loss in 2023.
 
The bitcoin bear market was relentless in 2022, driving many crypto institutions to bankruptcy. Crypto mining profitability fell within this period, and the hashrate and mining difficulty also increased, making the process more difficult.
 
 
In a recent development, Argo Blockchain, a leading cryptocurrency miner, has announced the departure of CEO Peter Wall from his official role. This announcement comes barely a week after the resignation of former CFO Alex Appleton.

In a series of tweets, Jesse Powell, co-founder and CEO of Kraken, stated that he hopes there will be an exchange that braves the SEC. However, he said, it will be a “brutal, lengthy, expensive fight.” For “risk-adjusted return” reasons, Kraken opted not to fight the case in court.
