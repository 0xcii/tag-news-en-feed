        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MicroStrategy, a leading business intelligence and software company, has continued its steadfast commitment to Bitcoin by purchasing an additional 14,620 BTC at a total cost of $615.7 million, Founder & Chairman Michael Saylor announced today. The purchase came as Bitcoin's price has been experiencing upward momentum, reaching highs of over $42,000.



The company initially entered the Bitcoin market in August 2020, making a significant initial investment of $250 million into BTC. Since then, they have consistently added to their Bitcoin holdings, creating a treasury reserve strategy that has garnered over 189,150 bitcoin worth more than $8.11 billion at the time of writing.
“On December 27, 2023, MicroStrategy Incorporated (“MicroStrategy”) announced that, during the period between November 30, 2023 and December 26, 2023, MicroStrategy, together with its subsidiaries, acquired approximately 14,620 bitcoins for approximately $615.7 million in cash, at an average price of approximately $42,110 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses,” MicroStrategy stated. “As of December 26, 2023, MicroStrategy, together with its subsidiaries, held an aggregate of approximately 189,150 bitcoins, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.895 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $31,168 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.”
As the fourth Bitcoin halving quickly approaches and the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States may be approved early into the new year, MicroStrategy continues its aggressive bitcoin investment strategy with no signs of slowing down.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum’s market behavior on Dec. 27, 2023 presents a complex tapestry of signals for traders and investors alike. Oscillating within a 24-hour price range of $2,189 to $2,290, Ethereum demonstrated a consolidation phase, subtly hinting at both potential gains and imminent cautions. As the market capitalization holds at $273 billion with significant trading volume, the second leading crypto asset’s future seems as volatile as it is promising.
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) stands at a price of $2,278 with a trading volume of $15.34 billion over the past 24 hours. ETH/USD oscillators and moving averages depict a market in a state of neutrality with a slight bias toward bullishness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent report released by security app De.Fi,  
researchers revealed that cryptocurrency users lost nearly $2 billion to scams,  
rug pulls, and hacks in 2023. Although this represents a significant reduction  
from the previous year, it underscores the ongoing vulnerability of the  
industry to security risks.
Market Decline and Improved Awareness Contribute to Lowered  
Crypto Risks
The decrease in losses is largely attributed to the  
implementation of enhanced security protocols, increased awareness within the  
community, and an overall decline in market activity. Notably, this reduction  
becomes even more substantial when factoring in the $40 billion lost to the  
collapses of stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs, crypto lender Celsius, and the  
FTX exchange.
