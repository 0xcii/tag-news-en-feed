Today, Bitcoin demand is reaching record highs as the approval of new spot Bitcoin ETFs has created a wave of institutional interest. 
Although dubbed a risky and volatile asset, Bitcoin remains a profitable investment, especially for its earliest investors. When it was launched in 2009, it was practically worthless. In 2010, it traded at $0.10. 
By 2013, it was hitting highs of $250—a 250,000 percent growth for early investors. Those who invested in 2017 would look at gains of over 6,700 percent in 2024 as the crypto asset briefly touched $70,000 recently.

The Bitcoin ecosystem has always had a dogmatic streak; it’s kind of an inherent part of it. It takes a certain degree of stubbornness or dogma to get involved in something like Bitcoin this early on and demonstrate the type of conviction necessary to hodl on for the ride. Bitcoin is almost 15 years old, and a lot of the newer people who just entered the space in the last few years don’t really understand how wildly different the entire landscape was even just five years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed $200 billion in cumulative trading volume since launching just three months ago.

JUST IN: 🇺🇸 US #Bitcoin spot ETFs trading volume surpasses $200 billion within just 3 months. 
Asia is next 🚀 pic.twitter.com/VxQdQJEIjN
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 10, 2024
  
  
  
According to data from The Block, the total volume for the SEC-approved funds crossed the $200 billion milestone on Tuesday. This comes after spot bitcoin ETFs saw a record monthly volume of $111 billion in March, triple that of February.
The ETFs debuted on January 11th when bitcoin traded around $45,000. Since then, bitcoin has climbed to an all-time high above $73,000, buoying interest and trading activity.
BlackRock's IBIT leads the volumes, which now hold over 265,000 bitcoins worth more than $18 billion. IBIT comprises nearly 50% of the total spot ETF volume. Meanwhile, Grayscale's GBTC and Fidelity's FBTC rank second and third in market share.
The success of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs has prompted applications in other markets like Hong Kong. Regulators there are expected to approve the first spot bitcoin ETFs in Asia this month, potentially adding more volume.
ETF providers cite surging institutional demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. The funds present an easy vehicle for both retail and professional investors to gain bitcoin price exposure.
The $200 billion cumulative volume indicates growing bitcoin's maturation since the last bull run when ETF hopes were repeatedly dashed.
The growth of bitcoin ETFs signals widening adoption by traditional finance, a mainstream integration that will likely persist as the asset class evolves.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures released by the United States have exceeded expectations, signaling a robust inflationary trend that could significantly influence the Federal Reserve’s forthcoming monetary policy decisions. The Bitcoin and crypto markets reacted with a swift downtrend. The BTC price initially dropped by 2.7%, falling below $67,200. Altcoins have reacted even more strongly to the data.
 
The non-seasonally adjusted CPI for March 2024 soared to an annual rate of 3.5%, surpassing both the anticipated figure of 3.4% and February’s rate of 3.2%, marking the highest inflation rate since September 2023. This uptick reflects not just a transient economic fluctuation but a deeper, more sustained inflationary pressure within the economy.
