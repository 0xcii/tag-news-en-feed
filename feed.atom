        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, April 12, 2023, at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time, Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade was successfully implemented, enabling validators to withdraw staked ether. Data reveals that more than 860,000 ether is poised for unlocking, and 77,000 ether is expected to be withdrawn on Thursday. Ether’s price has experienced a surge, rising 6% against the U.S. dollar within the past 24 hours.
 
Staked Ether Can Now be Withdrawn Following the Network’s Shapella Upgrade
 
Ethereum underwent a substantial update on April 12 when the Shapella hard fork launched, allowing validators to access their staked coins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s recent surge in price has been widely attributed to a variety of factors, such as the banking crisis, the dollar’s fall in dominance, and institutional adoption. However, recent data from Bank of America (BoA) analysts suggests that this surge might just be starting as there is still gas for more rallies.
 
The analyst reveals a growing trend of investors withdrawing their assets from exchanges and moving them to personal wallets, which is an indication of a long-term bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency as well as room for more rallies.
 
Bitcoin Still Has Gas For More Rally
 
Despite Bitcoin recently tapping into a major high of $30,000 up by over 80% since the start of the year, the BoA analysts believe the asset could still hit another major high sooner or later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin snapped a two-day losing streak on Thursday, as sentiment in crypto markets remained bullish. The meme coin moved to a one-week high, moving away from a key price floor in the process. Solana rose for a fifth straight session. 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) ended a two-day losing streak in today’s session, as prices rose by over 5% on Thursday.
 
Following a low of $0.0821 on Wednesday, DOGE/USD raced to a peak of $0.08838 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, the meme coin continued to to move away from a key level of support at $0.0810.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that today’s surge came as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 55.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at the 56.65 level, with a resistance of 60.00 a possible target for bulls.
 
Should this target be hit, there is a strong possibility that DOGE will be above $0.09000.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was once again in the green, as the token rose higher for a fifth straight session.
 
SOL/USD moved to an intraday high of $25.24 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after the price was at a low of $23.43.
 
This jump in price sent solana to its highest point since February 21, and closer to a key resistance level at $26.00.
 
 
Overall, recent gains have pushed the RSI deep into overbought territory, with the index currently tracking at 69.27.
 
This level is marginally below an upcoming ceiling at 70.00, which has already acted as a hurdle for earlier bulls.
 
At the time of writing, SOL is currently trading at $25.00, which is relatively lower than its earlier peak.

While the concept

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum moved above $2,000 on Thursday, as markets continue to react to the successful Shanghai update. The upgrade, which is also known as “Shapella,” took place late last night, enabling withdrawals on the blockchain. Bitcoin remained above $28,000.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade above the $30,000 mark on Thursday, as crypto markets remained buoyed by the latest U.S. inflation report, which fell to 5%.
 
Following a $29,725.57 low on Wednesday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak of $30,462.48 earlier in the day.
 
This move sees bitcoin remain near a ten-month high of $30,584, which it hit during Tuesday’s trading session.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s slight rise in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from its floor at 68.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 69.73, with the next visible point of resistance at 71.50.
 
Should the index move beyond this point, there is a good chance that ethereum will move past $30,500.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Boosted by the Shanghai update, ethereum (ETH) outperformed BTC in today’s session, climbing by around 7% in the process.
 
ETH/USD surged to a peak of $2,007.05 earlier in today’s session, less than a day after trading at $1,882.37.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency hit its highest level since last August.
 
 
This eight-month high came as price strength rose beyond a ceiling at 65.00. It is now at a reading of 69.44.
 
A resistance level of 75.00 appears to be the next hurdle for bulls, and should momentum continue in an upward direction, ETH could move above $2,100 this week.
