        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In what could be a significant shake-up for the SHIB community, Shibburn, the well-known burn tracker, has come forth with a flurry of allegations against the Shiba Inu project’s leadership. The detailed accusations touch on a variety of issues from historical revisionism to financial impropriety, and even extend to the governance and ethical standing of the project’s core team.
 
Shibburn’s statement begins with a historical correction: “Shibburn was the first actual project to launch for $SHIB, a month and 2 weeks before ShibaSwap.” This claim contests the narrative pushed by the Shiba Inu team that positions ShibaSwap as the cornerstone of the SHIB evolution. Shibburn accuses the team of historical revisionism, alleging they believe “their projects are the only ones that matters.”

Binance has agreed to pay more than $4 billion in fines and other charges as part of a settlement in which the whole federal government works together. Zhao is one of the most powerful people in the cryptocurrency world. He has decided to quit as CEO of the exchange he started and pay $200 million in fines.
 
The acknowledgment of culpability concerns the crypto exchange’s admittance of participation in illicit money transmission, anti-money laundering operations, and sanctions violations.

Former Greece finance minister and anti-capitalist, Yanis Varoufakis, has warned that Argentina’s incoming president Javier Milei is “no anarcho-capitalist” as many libertarians would like to believe.
