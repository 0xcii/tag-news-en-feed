        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nigeria’s once-tepid stance on cryptocurrency has taken a sharp turn towards prohibition. The Nigerian government, citing concerns over Naira manipulation, is proposing a ban on P2P (Peer-to-Peer) trading platforms that utilize the local currency. This move, coupled with ongoing legal battles with major exchanges, throws the future of Nigerian crypto into uncertainty.
 
 
Naira Under Siege? The P2P Battleground
 
The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleges that crypto participants and exchanges are manipulating the Naira’s value through P2P transactions. Emomotimi Agama, the newly appointed Director-General, suggests delisting the Naira from all P2P platforms as a remedy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Regulatory change in the crypto realm has been a subject of heated debate for many years. The general ethos of cryptocurrency is one of anarchism or anarcho-capitalism. Proponents of the tech tend to be adamantly against any type of governmental intervention into markets or technology.
