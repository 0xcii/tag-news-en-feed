During a halving, the rewards that Bitcoin miners receive for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain are slashed in half.

Data sourced from cryptoslam.io reveals that NFT sales on the Ethereum platform took the lion’s share, accounting for $38.10 million of the week’s turnover.
