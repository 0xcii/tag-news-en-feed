        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bank of Korea governor Rhee Chang-yong recently stated that the growing stablecoin use threatens the operations of central banks. The possible involvement of global networks like Visa and Mastercard in the stablecoin business will likely undermine the monetary independence of countries like South Korea. 
 
Central Banks Urged to Prepare for Digitization
 
The growing use of stablecoins like USDT and USDC is posing a new threat to the operations of central banks and may be making monetary policies less effective, according to Rhee Chang-yong, the governor of the Bank of Korea. Speaking at a recent digital money conference, Chang-yong urged central banks to prepare for digitization if they wish to keep abreast with the fast-changing financial landscape.
 
A Yonhap report states that the BOK governor believes global networks such as Visa and Mastercard’s likely involvement with stablecoins will undermine countries like South Korea’s monetary independence. Therefore, to stop stablecoins from wreaking havoc on his country’s capital inflows, Chang-yong proposed launching central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).
 
“This underscores the urgency for central banks to consider introducing central bank digital currencies (CBDC), whether retail or wholesale,” the BOK governor reportedly said.
 
 
While he conceded that retail CBDCs may have no clear advantage over regular payment methods, Chang-yong insisted that their programmability feature allows such digital currencies to bring with them “a realm of possibilities.” One such possibility is the execution of complex and conditional transactions automatically via smart contracts.
 
Meanwhile, the BOK also revealed that South Korea, which has already launched a pilot project for a retail CBDC system, is working on a wholesale pilot project. The South Korean Central Bank’s partners for the project include the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and financial regulators.

Similarities to Japan’s Lost Decades in China’s Current Economic Slowdown
 
In a compelling parallel drawn between the economic trajectories of Japan starting in the 1980s and China’s current economic landscape, experts are now closely examining the similarities and lessons that can be learned.
 
Japan, in the 1980s, experienced a period of significant economic growth, marked by strong wage growth and rising prices. However, this was followed by a prolonged period of economic stagnation and deflation, from which, according to some, Japan is only now beginning to emerge. The cri…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Solana Saga phone, which was previously having trouble finding a buyer, has had a remarkable turnaround this week, with devices selling for as high as $5,000 on the web marketplace Ebay—a sharp rise above its earlier summer markdown.
 
The main cause of this sharp change of demand, which occurred after critics labeled the phone a “failure,” is the meteoric rise of the Solana-based meme coin BONK, which has seen an increase in value of over 10,000% over the last two months.
 
 
Solana Saga Phones Soar With BONK Airdrop
 
Sales of Solana Saga phones increased last week as a result of certain arbitrage traders seemingly pursuing an airdrop of 30 million BONK tokens, which is distributed to all phone owners. In peak value last week, the airdrop was more than $700 for a $599 phone.

The bank organized a questionnaire of 38 questions divided into different themes that can be partially, or fully answered until January 31, 2024.
Central Bank of Brazil Seeks Input on VASP Regulation
The Central Bank of Brazil is preparing to finally issue rules for Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs) operating in the country. The institution opened a public consultation seeking input from market participants and individuals to prepare the rules VASPs would have to follow, according to the faculties it received since the approval and sanction of the cryptocurrency assets law in December 2023.
The bank introduced a 38-item questionnaire that can be answered totally or partially, indicating the numbers and themes respondents want to address in their statements.
Each question is part of a broader subject of the public consultation, including areas such as asset segregation and risk management, activities developed and virtual assets traded, hiring essential services, governance and conduct rules, cyber ​​security, providing information and protecting customers, transition rules, and general manifestations.
The issue of asset segregation has significance, given that it was initially proposed to be part of the final text of the approved cryptocurrency assets law, but was finally left out due to the limitations it would impose on the operations that VASPs could conduct. Tax exemptions for mining projects leveraging renewable energy were also left out of the final text and might be affected by these rules.
The public consultation process will be open until January 31, 2024, and all answers will be publicly available for review on the bank’s page.
