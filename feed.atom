In a post on X, Huogan notes that Bitcoin ETFs attracted $1.7 billion in the first 14 trading days, compared to $1.3 billion for gold ETFs. This trend may suggest a shift in investor preference, with some viewing Bitcoin as a digital alternative to traditional safe-haven assets.
 
Even so, when adjusted for inflation, gold flows remain slightly larger. However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin ETFs were launched when gold had established its presence in the market, becoming a store of value asset for the better part of human history.
