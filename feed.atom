U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has requested a summary judgment  
from a federal judge in its case against Do Kwon and Terraform Labs, in a move  
aimed at avoiding a full trial. The SEC argues that there is "no genuine  
dispute as to any material fact" in the case, emphasizing that Kwon and  
Terraform sold securities.
SEC's

The  
SEC's filing states that there is no dispute regarding the fact that purchasers  
invested money, whether in fiat currency or crypto assets. This assertion  
aligns with the regulator's argument that Kwon and Terraform Labs offered  
securities. The  
case centers around whether the assets sold meet the criteria of an investment  
contract under the Howey test, a legal assessment used to determine if a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other meme coins experienced a whirlwind of activity as October unfolded. The crypto market witnessed a remarkable surge in SHIB’s value as Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new milestone at $35,000, though it subsequently pulled back to the $34,000 level. 
 
This substantial upward momentum spurred investors to act swiftly and secure positions in anticipation of what promises to be an exciting bull run. However, as we enter November, the crucial question looming over the market is whether these gains can be sustained.
 
 
Shiba Inu Recent Performance
 
Shiba Inu came tantalizingly close to initiating a fresh recovery phase, aiming to break through resistance at the $0.000008 mark. Still, profit booking and, potentially, a lack of buyers led to a minor pullback. As of the latest…]]></summary>

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell 3.3% to $34,195 amid light trading volume of $20.79 billion over the last 24 hours. The relative strength index (RSI) reading of 70 indicates bitcoin is approaching overbought levels, while the Stochastic oscillator of 86 suggests the crypto may be due for some more pullback.
