        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cybercriminals have reportedly breached AT&T email accounts and are using the access gained to steal crypto assets from their victims. While a spokesperson for AT&T has denied claims that hackers have gained access to the company’s internal systems, a report suggests that as much as $20 million worth of crypto may have been stolen.
 
Criminals ‘Used an API Access’
 
Cybercriminals have reportedly gained access to AT&T email accounts and are using this to hack into targeted victims’ crypto exchange accounts. According to a Techcrunch report, the criminals using this modus operandi may have stolen crypto assets worth between $15 million and $20 million.
 
Although two victims are said to have confirmed the theft, a spokesperson for AT&T has in the meantime rejected suggestions that criminals have gained access to the company’s internal systems.
 
“There was no intrusion into any system for this exploit. The bad actors used an API access,” said Jim Kimberly, the spokesperson for AT&T.
 

 
As explained in the Techcrunch report, unknown parties are thought to have found a way of hacking into personal AT&T email accounts that use att.net, sbcglobal.net, and bellsouth.net addresses. To achieve this, the hackers reportedly use access to the telecommunication company’s internal network which then enables them to create mail keys for any user.
 
Having gained a targeted person’s keys, the criminals are then able to login and reset the victim’s passwords including those on crypto exchange apps. To prove that cybercriminals have indeed gained access to AT&T’s internal systems, a whistleblower is said to have shared a list of the hackers’ alleged victims.
 
While AT&T has acknowledged the “unauthorized creation of secure mail keys,” the spokesperson insisted that the company had responded to this by updating its security controls. The company said it has locked some email accounts to force the owners to reset passwords.

Already on Tuesday, BTC experienced a sudden rally after First Republic Bank released its quarterly report with devastating numbers.
 
Thus, the narrative that first surfaced on March 10 repeated itself. After the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate, news of a bank failure served as a trigger for several upward moves in Bitcoin. And First Republic Bank could be another argument boosting confidence in Bitcoin and eroding trust in the banking system.

The crypto giant had looked into the relocation option due to regulatory scrutiny and lack of clarity from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
In previous efforts to get the needed clarity to operate freely and offer crypto services to their US customers, the US-based crypto trading platform asked the SEC for reasonable crypto rules and regulations for Americans. This move made by Coinbase was met with legal threats from the regulator and a Wells notice.

In a historic verdict, US District Judge Lee Yeakel has ordered a South African executive to pay more than $3.4 billion in restitution and fines for a fraud scheme involving Bitcoin. 
 
Cornelius Johannes Steynberg, the founder and CEO of Mirror Trading International Proprietary, was involved in a global “fraudulent multilevel marketing scheme” to solicit Bitcoin from people for participation in an unregistered commodity pool operated by Mirror Trading.
 
The scheme resulted in the solicitation of at least 29,421 Bitcoin, worth more than $1.7 billion in March 2021, from at least 23,000 individuals in the United States and from around the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Micheal Saylor, the founder of Microstrategy, has told people living in inflation-stricken Argentina that they now “need bitcoin.” While many bitcoiners have welcomed Saylor’s suggestion, a few critics have said the top crypto asset’s volatility makes it an unsuitable alternative for the faltering local currency. 
 
The Dollarization Option
 

 
As the Argentinian currency — the peso — continued with the slide that has seen it depreciate by more than 40% over the past twelve months, Micheal Saylor, the founder of Microstrategy, has chimed in by tweeting that people living in the South American country now “need bitcoin.” In a subsequent tweet, Saylor, a bitcoin critic turned advocate, also shared news about the South American country’s inflation rate after it topped 7.58% per day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump has warned that the U.S. dollar is crashing and soon will “no longer be the world standard.” The former president of the United States further warned that “we are very close” to a third world war happening. “Joe Biden has led us to the very brink of World War III,” he stressed.
 
Trump on Inflation, Dollar Crashing, World War III
 
Donald Trump released a video Tuesday following Joe Biden’s announcement that he is running for the president of the United States in 2024.
 
The former U.S. president began by outlining the damage to the U.S. economy caused by Biden in a few short years, including his “spending calamity.” Trump described:
 

American families are being decimated by the worst inflation in half a century. Banks are failing, our currency is crashing, and the dollar will soon no longer be the world standard, which will be our greatest defeat in over 200 years.
 
“Joe Biden has led us to the very brink of World War III,” Trump continued. However, he clarified: “I’m not predicting World War III but I will say this, we are very close.” He then promised that if he’s elected president in 2024, “we will prevent World War III from happening.”
 
Trump recently warned that China is trying to displace the U.S. dollar as the number one currency throughout the world. He also cautioned that the USD losing its world’s reserve currency status is like America “losing a world war,” emphasizing: “We’ll be a second-tier country.”
 
This week, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, also urged all countries to make efforts to avoid the outbreak of a new, full-scale global conflict. “We all need to work to ensure that this threat of global confrontation, of a hot, full-scale World War III should not materialize,” the Russian official said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The agreement is set to bring approximately $7.5 million of annual revenue according to Greenidge CEO Dave Anderson.
Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc. has signed a hosting agreement with Core Scientific, Inc. in which Core Scientific will operate and host 6,914 Greenidge-owned bitcoin miners at its facilities in Dalton, GA and Calvert City, KY. 
"The agreement with Core Scientific completes this phase in our strategy to deploy 9,150 miners Greenidge owns, and we believe this agreement will significantly improve our profitability as we move forward," said Dave Anderson, CEO of Greenidge. "We are very pleased to deploy these miners at Core's facilities, which have favorable power costs and a track record of excellent operational performance."
In addition to the hosting agreement, Greenidge announced the installation of an additional 1,500 company-owned miners at the company's existing facilities across the country. With the combination of these two initiatives and the previously announced agreement with Conifex Timber Inc., Greenidge expects to generate approximately $7.5 million of incremental annual profit, according to Anderson.
Matt Minnis, Co-Founder of Core Scientific, expressed his excitement about the partnership, stating, "Greenidge is a proven operator in this industry, and we're excited to partner with them and host their miners. We believe this is a win-win for Core and Greenidge."
The hosting agreement is set to be a one-year agreement between Greenidge and Core Scientific and includes a proceed-sharing component to recognize the contribution of miners by Greenidge and the infrastructure and operating expertise provided by Core Scientific.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
