Grewal emphasized the necessity of obtaining clarity on how regulatory agencies are approaching digital assets, stating, “In short, so long as the government will not relent, neither will Coinbase.”
 
Coinbase Aims To Reveal Crucial Regulatory Communications
 
The first FOIA request seeks documents relating to the cap on digital asset deposits imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and other banking regulators on financial institutions.
 
The second request aims to gather logs detailing how these agencies manage other FOIA requests. These ne…]]></summary>

When questioned about the risks of having a significant amount of BTC held by third-party custodians and large institutions, Saylor dismissed concerns of increased seizure or confiscation.
