The convertible bond, initially sold during the pandemic as demand for tech and growth stocks soared, has now reached a two-year high, benefiting from the recovery in digital asset prices. 
 
According to Bloomberg, this resurgence in the bond’s value mirrors a broader resurgence in the appetite for convertible bonds, particularly in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, where some firms have successfully issued bonds with no coupon.

Analysts at BitMEX have recently weighed in on this matter, highlighting a critical aspect that might impact the attractiveness of these ETFs to investors: the provision of staking yields.
 
According to the analyst, ETH’s offering of staking rewards presents both an opportunity and a challenge for formulating ETFs around the digital asset.
