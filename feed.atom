        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-consolidates-close-to-26300-support-level-market-volatility-remains-high/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-08T12:35:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated close to a key price floor of $26,300 on Thursday, as a downward death cross sent the cryptocurrency lower. Overall sentiment in the market remains lower, with the global cryptocurrency market cap falling by 1.58% as of writing. Ethereum also declined, after nearing a move above $1,900 on Wednesday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated during Thursday’s session, as market volatility remained high ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision.
 
BTC/USD slipped to a low of $26,146.99 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at $26,897.25.
 
Today’s move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency briefly break out of a key support point at $26,300.
 
 
Since this earlier fall, BTC bulls have moved to buy the dip in price, with the cryptocurrency now once again above this floor.
 
This comes as the relative strength index (RSI) pivots from a recent free fall, and is now en route to a ceiling at 47.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.87, which comes as the 10-day (red) moving average fell below its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) edged lower in today’s session, a day after prices neared a breakout above the $1,900 level.
 
Following a high of $1,896 on Wednesday, ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,822.30.
 
As a result of this decline, ethereum moved below a key support point of $1,830, before bulls moved to stabilize this level.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that bulls decided to reenter the market as the RSI found its own floor at 47.00.
 
Currently, the index is at a reading of 48.52, which is marginally below a ceiling at 49.00.

Bitget’s Martingale AI: A New AI-Centric Tool for Crypto Traders
 
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a significant topic this year. On Wednesday, crypto exchange Bitget announced the launch of a new AI-centric tool to assist traders. The Marting AI strategy aims to provide novice crypto traders with a convenient and advanced investment strategy enabled by AI.
 
The strategy utilizes historical market patterns and comprehensive information on market behavior and can be leveraged in both bear and bull market situations. On Wednesday, Gracy Chen, the managing director of Bitget, stated that the company plans to integrate more AI into its products to empower users.
 
“The launch of Martingale AI represents Bitget’s commitment to empowering users with the tools and strategies to invest confidently and smartly according to their needs,” Chen said. “Providing simple yet sophisticated offerings that leverage the power of AI aligns with Bitget’s mission to help individuals safely embrace digital assets.”
 
Bitget believes that both experienced and novice traders will benefit from the Martingale AI strategy. The company stated that Martingale AI provides customizable and automated trading strategies and supports up to 100x leverage.
 
“Novice traders can try strategies that are devised with a lower threshold by leveraging the AI and selecting according to the types divided by the system, namely – conservative, balanced and aggressive,” Bitget’s announcement on Wednesday detailed.
