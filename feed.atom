Stake’s Alleged $41 Million Hack
 
The platform which allows users to deposit, bet on sports games, and play games with cryptocurrencies, experienced several unusual transactions which ultimately led to the alleged hack on Monday.
 
Blockchain security firm Peckshield noticed the unusual transactions and told Decrypt that the transfers looked suspicious, and went on to ask if the platform was under maintenance.
 
 
However, the betting platform later confirmed on X (formerly Twitter) a few hours later that the transactions were “unauthorized” which proved the company was hacked by someone, and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has announced that it now accepting Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a payment option through PayPal for Coloradans to renew driver's licenses, identification cards, and vehicle registrations.
“At the DMV, we’re always looking for ways to better serve Coloradans and leverage technology to offer our services,” said Senior Director Electra Bustle. “This new online cryptocurrency payment option is yet another way the DMV is providing innovative and convenient service delivery to our customers.”
Here's how it works: customers just have to select the cryptocurrency payment option, and they will be redirected to PayPal, where they can choose their preferred cryptocurrency to complete the transaction. The selected cryptocurrency is then converted into dollars, covering the total amount due along with applicable fees, before being remitted to the DMV.
However, it's important to note that there is a service fee associated with using cryptocurrency, amounting to $1 plus 1.83% of the total DMV charges. Additionally, PayPal may apply its own fees. As of now, PayPal is the sole cryptocurrency provider accepted for online DMV payments.

In this piece I'm going to focus solely on the issues regarding incentives for brevity's sake.

Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Surged Back Towards High Levels
 
The “mining hashrate” refers to the total amount of computing power that the miners have attached to the Bitcoin blockchain. This metric can tell us about the interest in mining the asset among these chain validators.
 
If the indicator trends up, it signals that new miners are coming into the blockchain and/or old ones are expanding their facilities, likely because they are finding the network profitable to mine on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After six consecutive days of trading in the red, dogecoin rose higher on Tuesday, after bouncing at a key price floor. The meme coin was a notable gainer in today’s session, despite market sentiment mostly tracking lower. Polygon was also in the green, extending recent gains in the process.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin ended a six-day losing streak on Tuesday, as prices rebounded from a recent point of support.
 
Following a low of $0.06246 on Monday, DOGE/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $0.06422 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move comes as the meme coin surged from a floor at $0.0620, with bulls now likely targeting a ceiling of $0.0680.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the bounce in price comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose from a floor at 39.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 42.66, with the next point of resistance around 47.00.
 
In the event that this is broken, there is a good chance that DOGE will move back towards $0.07000.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was also trading higher in today’s session, with price climbing for a fourth straight day.
 
MATIC/USD peaked at $0.5634 on Tuesday, which comes following a low of $0.5406 to start the week.
 
As a result of the move, polygon climbed to its strongest point since last Thursday, when the price reached a high of $0.5885.
 
 
Overall, with this current uptrend, it appears that MATIC could be heading towards a key resistance point of $0.6000.
 
In order to get there, the RSI, which is tracking at 40.08, will first need to move past an upcoming ceiling at the 41.00 level.
