On Tuesday, Singh pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stated, “I am unbelievably sorry for my role in all of this.”
 
Singh Cooperating With Authorities in FTX Investigation; Bankman-Fried Declines to Comment on Singh’s Guilty Plea
 
Former FTX director of engineering Nishad Singh pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, money laundering, and violating campaign finance laws in the United States, according to reports.
 
“I am unbelievably sorry for my role in all of this,” Singh said in a New York court on Tuesday. During the hearing, Singh’s prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, explained that Singh flew back from the Bahamas to assist with the U.S. investigation after FTX collapsed.
 
Singh stated that he knew around mid-2022 that Alameda Research was using customer funds, and he also pledged to forfeit the proceeds he obtained from the scheme. Reuters first reported the news, and following Singh’s plea, the publication contacted Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) for comment.
 
 
According to the report, a spokesman for Bankman-Fried declined to comment. Singh’s plea comes after ex-Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang pleaded guilty. Ellison provided a detailed account that also acknowledged the use of customer funds in the FTX/Alameda scheme. Bankman-Fried faces 12 charges, including bank fraud, after four new charges were added to his initial indictment.
