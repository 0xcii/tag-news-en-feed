        <updated>2023-12-26T21:09:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, something interesting happened in the world of cryptocurrency. Justin Sun, the person who started Tron, took out a huge amount of Ethereum (ETH), about $13.8 million, from Binance, a major crypto exchange.
 
A company that keeps tabs of blockchain transactions, PeckShieldAlert, said it looked suspicious and linked to Sun. This got a lot of people in the crypto community talking and wondering what was going on.
 
 
Justin Sun Pullout Causes ETH To Drop
 
What made it more puzzling was that right when Sun took out the money, the price of Ethereum went down a bit. But, surprisingly, more people started trading Ethereum, and the trading volume increased by over 15%.
 
This made everyone even more curious, especially because Sun is known for doing bold things in the crypto world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Digital Currency Group (DCG) founder Barry Silbert has resigned from his position as the chairman of Grayscale Investments. Current DCG chief financial officer Mark Shifke succeeds Silbert and is joined by Edward McGee and Matthew Kummell as members of the new look board. 
 
Preparing for Grayscale’s Next Chapter
 
Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, has resigned from his position as chairman of the digital asset management company Grayscale and will be replaced by Mark Shifke.
 
According to the company’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), starting Jan. 1, 2024, Grayscale’s board will be composed of Mark Shifke, Matthew Kummell, and Edward McGee. Current Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein is also a board member, while Mark Murphy, the president of Digital Currency Group (DCG), departs alongside Silbert.
 
 
Commenting on the changes to the board, an unidentified Grayscale spokeswoman reportedly said:
 
“Grayscale and our investors will benefit from their respective experiences in the financial services and asset management industries as we prepare for Grayscale’s next chapter.”
 
The changes to the Grayscale Investments board are coming at a time when the SEC is considering the company’s request to turn its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

7-Day Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Set A New Record
 
The “mining hashrate” refers to the total amount of computing power currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. This metric is very relevant for the BTC network, as its value can have a direct influence on the chain’s security.
 
A larger hashrate means that there are more nodes for a malicious attacker to go through, as such an attack can only be successful if the attacker can bring under control at least 51% of the hashrate.
 
 
This benefit on the security from a higher value of the indicator only appears, though, if the new hashrate that’s being added by the miners is sufficiently dece…]]></summary>

In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Yakovenko elaborated on his “Solana is Ethereum” comment as he stated that THE NETWORK is also a layer-2 network for Ethereum through the “wormhole eigenlayer.” With this, Yakovenko raised the prospect of Solana and Ethereum being interoperable despite operating different protocols and consensus mechanisms.

In their 2023 Crypto Crime Report, Chainalysis alleged that YieldNodes, a Hong Kong based project which rents out computing power to participate in a masternode pool, is a scam.

MS Drainer Allows Criminals to Siphon Over $58 Million
A recent report from Scam Sniffer, an anti-scam platform used by several Web3 wallets, has revealed that a certain malware type has managed to siphon over $58 million from cryptocurrency holders. The tool, called MS Wallet Drainer, attacks the cryptocurrency wallets (Ethereum, BNB, and other EVM chains and rollups) of victims using Google and X ads to infect their devices and drain them of any available funds and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
The malware is distributed using the search results of Google searches for popular cryptocurrency sites and decentralized finance exchanges, such as Zapper, Lido, Stargate, Defillama, Orbiter Finance, and Radiant. The same malware was also detected in a series of Ordinals-related X ads, and a recent sampling of X ads on some feeds resulted in more than 60% of the ads leading to sites using the MS Drainer.
The report highlights that these ads use several techniques to obfuscate their purposes and pass advertising audits. For example, they only target certain regions and use redirection to bypass revisions.
One of the victims lost over $24 million in an Ethereum wallet, while another lost over $1 million in Ethereum assets. An investigation revealed that the tool is available in darknet forums with a price of $1,500 for a standard functionality set. While other similar malware tools are fully managed and charge a 20% fee, this one only charges for modules that add additional functionality to the standard package.
What do you think about the MS Wallet Drainer and its usage of Google and X phishing ads as a distribution method? Tell us in the comments section below.]]></summary>
