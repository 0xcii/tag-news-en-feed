U.S. Economy and Stagflation
 
Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff warned about the U.S. economy facing a period of stagflation, characterized by high inflation and high unemployment, in an interview with Fox News Thursday. Schiff explained:
 

In Q1 of this year, inflation actually strengthened over the fourth quarter of last year. So, not only is the economy weakening, but inflation is strengthening. You have the worst of both worlds. This is stagflation and it’s going to get worse.

Bitcoin Miners Have Made A Profit Of 37% On Their Total Investment
 
In a recent tweet, Glassnode posted the latest data on where the miners currently stand regarding their revenue, cost, and profit. First, to calculate the revenue of these chain validators, the analytics firm has taken the sum of the “thermocap” and the transaction fees that this cohort has earned throughout their lifetime.
 
The thermocap is an indicator that measures the cumulative sum of the issuance multiplied by the spot price of Bitcoin. In simpler terms, this metric tells us the total value of the block rewards that the miners have earned over the network’s lifetime.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Inc. is facing a class-action lawsuit for allegedly collecting face templates and fingerprints of its customers without their consent, in violation of Illinois' new biometric privacy law. 
The suit, which was filed in federal court in San Francisco, claims that Coinbase harvests facial data from IDs and selfies that customers upload.
As reported by Bloomberg, the company also harvests fingerprint data when customers log into their accounts using the required fingerprint scanning technology. The company's collection and storage of this data exposes users to "serious and irreversible privacy risks,” according to the lawsuit.
The case highlights the growing concern over data privacy and the need for companies to be transparent about how they collect and use user data, especially sensitive biometric information such as facial recognition and fingerprint data. 
As more companies collect and store biometric data, it's likely that lawsuits like this will become more common, underscoring the importance of strong data privacy practices that work to prevent the misappropriation of such sensitive information in the first place.
While Bitcoin is an inherently transparent database, and many of the onramps that are most often used to buy and sell bitcoin require full KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance, there are steps that Bitcoin users can take to minimize leaks of private data.]]></summary>

Now Marco Santori, the company's chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
