        <updated>2023-08-29T16:11:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, it was announced that the DC Circuit court of appeals is vacating SEC's denial of Grayscale's $GBTC conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF. 
"We agree," said Circuit Judge RAO. "The denial of Grayscale's proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products. We therefore grant Grayscale's petition and vacate the order."
 
         
         
         
         
    
It is important to note that this does not mean GBTC is automatically being converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, although this victory does bring us one step closer to that reality. The order is being vacated and sent back to the SEC. The SEC now has 45 days to appeal and file for an en banc hearing, which means the case will be heard by all 17 judges on the court instead of just the three that were involved in today's decision, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. 
"The Commission neither disputed Grayscale's evidence that the spot and future markets for bitcoin are 99.9% correlated, nor suggested that market inefficiencies or other factors would undermine the correlation...The Commission’s unexplained discounting of the obvious financial and mathematical relationship between the spot and futures markets falls short of the standard for reasoned decision making," Circuit Judge RAO. continued.
The price of GBTC pumped over 19% on the news and Bitcoin rose above 5%.]]></summary>

An AMM Under Ripple’s Latest Version
 
A novel automated market maker (AMM), also known as the XLS-30, is one of the amendments expected to be made to the XRP Ledger when the rippled version 1.12 is released on September 11, 2023. 
 
 
As noted by pro-XRP financial consultant Panos Mekras, the AMM proposal, if passed, will allow XRP holders “to earn, for the first time, income on-chain.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin returned to the red on Tuesday, as markets began to anticipate the upcoming consumer confidence report in the United States. The Conference Board index is expected to fall to a reading of 116 in August, from 117 the month prior. Ethereum was also marginally lower.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin slipped slightly during Tuesday’s session, as markets began to anticipate the upcoming consumer confidence report from the United States.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,914.93 earlier in today’s session, following a peak of $26,406.15 on Monday.
 
The decline sees bitcoin remain in consolidation, however some traders are optimistic about this ending as the week progresses.
 
 
Looking at the chart, one of the reasons for this long stretch of price uncertainty is the relative strength index (RSI) failing to surge past resistance.
 
In this case, the aforementioned ceiling is at the 33.00 mark, which has remained intact for nearly two weeks.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 30.72.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) edged marginally lower on Tuesday, as it continued to trade close to a support point of its own.
 
Following a high of $1,665.14 to start the week, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,641.63 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw ethereum once again fall below a support point of $1,650, which it has hovered around for the last ten days.
 
 
As of writing, the index remains in oversold territory, with a reading of 30.92, and appears to be heading for a floor at 29.00.
 
Should it reach this point there is a strong chance that ethereum will move under $1,630.

As a Swiss citizen, it didn’t take me long to understand why Bitcoin is unique. Switzerland is a country that values lots of the critical aspects that Bitcoin offers to people. The small country in the middle of Europe encourages self sovereignty, privacy and financial literacy. The pioneering Swiss banking secrecy was codified in 1934. This regulation, along with its political neutrality and enduring stability, makes the country a “safe haven” for companies and institutions that deal with money.

For one, they believe the regulator is trying to smear the token’s reputation with this argument.
 
Is SEC Trying to Malign XRP?
 
Pro-XRP legal expert Bill Morgan has tagged this view by the SEC as “negative and reactionary.” He believes that the SEC either doesn’t understand XRP or deliberately wants to hinder Ripple’s progress as a decentralized payment system.
 
 
The SEC first claimed that XRP has no intrinsic value in its memorandum of law in opposition to Ripple’s motion for summary judgment. Furthermore, the regulator argued that XRP had no intrinsic value in opposition to Ripple’s two arguments in…]]></summary>

DeOrderBook, a groundbreaking decentralized finance (DeFi) optionality protocol, is gearing up for its Ethereum mainnet launch, ushering in a new era for DeFi users who seek unprecedented capital flexibility, advanced hedging mechanisms, and sustainable real yield.
 
At launch, the protocol supports $WBTC and $USDC although the team is actively working on support for further coins and chains.
 
What makes DeOrderBook especially interesting?
 
DeOrderBook’s unique design represents a significant departure from traditional DeFi protocols by providing an automated way to monetise an optionality position — think about it as a Uniswap for optionality.
