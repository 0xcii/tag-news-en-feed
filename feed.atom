of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)'s crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, took the stand to  
testify against him in the second day of her appearance today (Wednesday). Her  
testimony revealed aspects of SBF’s character, who faces allegations of fraud  
related to the collapse of FTX. 
In a report by Reuters, Ellison described SBF as a  
"utilitarian" who believed that the only moral rule that mattered was  
doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people. She further stated  
that he didn't think basic rules like "don't lie" or "don't  
steal" fit into his utilitarian framework. This perspective allegedly created  
an environment where people around him felt comfortable doing what they knew  
was ethically wrong.

The saga continued on its sixth day with ex-Alameda chief, Caroline Ellison, sharing her insights for the second consecutive day.

The crucial highlight of her statements centers around an alleged conspiracy to manipulate Bitcoin prices by selling the cryptocurrency if it surpassed the $20,000 mark.
 
 
Bitcoin Price Scandal Unveiled
 
During the proceedings, Ellison disclosed damning conversations and documents that shed light on potential market manipulation. 
 
In one instance, she revealed a conversation note in which she wrote, “Keep selling BTC if it’s over $20K,” suggesting a deliberate effort to suppress Bitcoin prices. The prosecution pressed further, questioning …]]></summary>

Chainway's recent demonstration serves as a proof of concept, illustrating how their future ZK rollup is intended to function when integrated with bitcoin. This integration seeks to combine the flexibility and programmability commonly associated with EVM and the robust security infrastructure inherent to bitcoin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum’s shift from a deflationary to an inflationary model has witnessed a 0.178% uptick in the last 17 days. During this period, the network added 22,502 ether, valued at $35.31 million, to its total supply.
 
Ethereum’s Growing Inflation Fueled by Onchain Downturn
 
Previously, Ethereum maintained a deflationary stance, primarily due to the London hard fork’s EIP-1559 and the notable shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Yet, the past few months saw a marked decline in onchain activities.
 
Consequently, the EIP-1559’s fee-burning mechanism has been torching fewer ethers. Just 17 days back, Ethereum’s issuance rate was slightly inflationary, standing at 0.270% annually. But as of now, it hovers around 0.448%, marking a rise of 0.178%.
