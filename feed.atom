        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is making its entry into the bitcoin mining sector. In a recent declaration by Phoenix Group PLC, a bitcoin mining enterprise, it was revealed that the company successfully garnered $370 million through an initial public offering (IPO) that was highly sought after, achieving a 33-fold oversubscription.
 
UAE Forges New Path in Bitcoin Mining With Phoenix Group’s $370M IPO
 
Bitcoin mining and blockchain infrastructure firm Phoenix Group has announced it’s raised 1.3 billion UAE dirhams ($370 million) in an IPO that started on November 16 and closed two days later. The company will be listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) with the ticker PHX.
 
“The overwhelming interest during the offer period is a powerful endorsement of our pioneering role in cryptocurrency mining and blockchain,” Bijan Alizadehfard, the co-founder and group CEO of Phoenix said.
 
The company’s prospectus says that it has established significant operations including a mining farm in Oman in collaboration with Green Data City and Microbt. Phoenix is also involved in multiple other ventures, such as hosting agreements with PTC Cloud Tech – FZCO, power supply contracts with Marlboro Electric Cooperative, and a 20% stake in Bitzero Inc.
 
 
The prospectus details that the company’s focus initially is on growth and expansion, with plans to adopt an active dividend policy after 2-3 years. This strategy is designed to return to shareholders substantially all of its distributable free cash flow while maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. Phoenix co-founder Munaf Ali added the capital raise from the IPO was a significant milestone.
 
“The exceptional oversubscription during our offer period is a clear indicator of the market’s endorsement of Phoenix Group as a leader in Cryptocurrency Mining and Blockchain Technology,” Ali stated.

Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Estimated To See Almost 4% Rise This Weekend
 
The Bitcoin “difficulty” refers to a feature on the blockchain that controls how hard the miners would find it to mine blocks right now. The metric’s value is measured in terms of the number of hashes that miners would need to generate before the next block can be found.
 
The network automatically adjusts its difficulty approximately every two weeks, and according to data from CoinWarz, the Bitcoin difficulty is set to see another such adjustment over the upcoming weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Friday, Wallet of Satoshi, a provider of Lightning Network payment services, announced its departure from the U.S. market, though it refrained from providing specific reasons. The firm informed its U.S. clientele that they could “withdraw and transfer” their funds to a different wallet.
 
Wallet of Satoshi Halts U.S. Operations
 
A recent update on X (previously known as Twitter) revealed that Wallet of Satoshi (WoS), headquartered in Australia, is ceasing operations in the United States. WoS, an application available on iOS and Android, enables users to manage bitcoin (BTC) and Lightning Network transactions. Daniel Alexiuc established the company in 2018.
 
The announcement from WoS expressed, “We’ve made the difficult decision to remove our app from the U.S. Apple and Google app stores, and will not serve U.S. customers going forward.” The statement emphasized, “This decision doesn’t come lightly. Our commitment to providing a secure, user-friendly, and compliant platform globally is unwavering. Our top priority is the safety and interests of our customers and our company.”
 
Further, the WoS statement mentioned:
 

We understand this may be disappointing news and we share your frustration. We’re hopeful that future developments will allow us to revisit and possibly resume our operations in the U.S.
 
 
This move coincides with what was shaping up to be a record-breaking month for WoS, as observed by Kevin Rooke. “Wallet of Satoshi is on pace to process over 1.1 million Lightning payments in November,” stated Rooke two days prior. He attributed the surge in transactions this month largely to effective Lightning advertising.

Cramer Advocates Bitcoin Investments
 
Jim Cramer, a TV host for the American investment advice show, Mad Money has shocked the crypto community with his sudden endorsement of Bitcoin.
 
 
Earlier in December 2022, when BTC was trading above $17,000 Cramer had urged investors to sell off all their Bitcoin assets. The investment advisor had encouraged investors to steer clear of the cryptocurrency, citing that it was never too late to sell an awful position.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a decision by the Podgorica High Court, ex-Terraform Labs chief executive Do Hyeong Kwon (Do Kwon) is set to be extradited following his four-month incarceration in Montenegro for fabricating travel papers. The extradition bids originate from both the United States and South Korea, with the final determination of Kwon’s destination resting in the hands of the court’s Justice Minister.
 
Judge Will Decide on Do Kwon’s Extradition
 
The notorious Do Kwon is poised for extradition upon completing his sentence in Montenegro, though his ultimate destination remains uncertain. A recent press release reveals that South Korea seeks Kwon for engaging in fraudulent and unfair trading activities. Additionally, the U.S. also desires his extradition for similar infractions, including securities fraud and market manipulation.
 
According to the press release, Kwon agreed to be extradited to South Korea. However, the court noted that due to multiple extradition requests, the Podgorica High Court must make the final determination. “The final decision on the matter will be made by the Minister of Justice of Montenegro,” the announcement specifies.
 
 
The announcement from the Podgorica High Court further clarifies, “If the Minister of Justice allows the final extradition of the aforementioned accused, the extradition will be executed after the completion of the criminal sentence imposed by the Basic Court in Podgorica in a case against the same individual for the criminal offense of document forgery.”
