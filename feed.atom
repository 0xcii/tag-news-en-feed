Valuation Must Not Drop $5B
The report further outlined that early-stage investors or Circle employees are mostly liquidating their holdings in the company in the secondary markets. Interestingly, Circle, which is planning to go public in the US with an initial public offering (IPO), is not allowing the secondary market to trade below a $5 billion valuation.
