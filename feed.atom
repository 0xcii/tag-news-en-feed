        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Ripple Labs, David Schwartz, delivered a nuanced perspective on the complexities surrounding the classification of tokens as securities yesterday. Although he did not mention XRP, it seems clear that he is talking about Ripple’s battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). His analysis delves deep into the intricacies of the Howey test and its application on cryptocurrencies, like XRP.
 
Schwartz opened his post on X by stating, “I’ve talked a little bit about US securities law, and I’m going to do that a little bit more. As most of you know, the primary argument that some tokens are securities comes from the inclusion of ‘investment contracts’ in the list of things that are securities.”

This increase in price can be attributed to a number of things that have occurred over the last few days. However, the question remains of whether the DOGE price can continue this run to cross $0.09.
 
Why Is The Dogecoin Price Rising?
 
The most prominent reason behind the rise in the Dogecoin price can be traced back to general market bullishness. Despite the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delaying its decision on the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the market has been relentless and continued to push the Bitcoin price higher.
 
 
As the Bitcoin price crossed $38,000, it pulled the rest of the market with it and sent altcoins rallying. This time, DOGE saw better recovery p…]]></summary>
