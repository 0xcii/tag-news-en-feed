Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Hasn’t Yet Hit The Peaks Of Previous Cycles
 
In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock discusses the historical trend of the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio. The “MVRV Ratio” is a popular BTC on-chain indicator that compares the asset’s market cap and realized cap.

Particularly, on-chain data shows that the activity among large holders has spiked positively in the past 24 hours. This data is reflected through the large holder netflow on IntoTheBlock (ITB), which suggests a 45% increase in the past 24 hours and a 3,840% increase in the past 48 hours.
