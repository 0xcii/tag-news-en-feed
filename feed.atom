        <updated>2024-04-20T00:15:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin halving just took place at block number 840,000. This event today reduced the mining reward for each block to 3.125 Bitcoins from 6.25 Bitcoins. New Bitcoins are introduced into circulation through these mining rewards.
Another Bitcoin Halving
Halving is one of the most significant events in the cryptocurrency world and occurs approximately every four years, specifically after every 210,000 blocks. It greatly reduces the supply of Bitcoin, thus helping to control inflation by maintaining scarcity.
Bitcoin was created on 3 January 2009. Initially, the reward for mining each block was 50 Bitcoins. The mining reward was first halved on 28 November 2012 in the first halving event. The next halving event took place on 9 July 2016, reducing the mining reward to 12.5 Bitcoins per block, while the third halving on 11 May 2020 reduced it further to 6.25 Bitcoins.
Now, the reward for mining each Bitcoin block is 3.125 Bitcoins.
The Cap of 21 Million Bitcoins
Bitcoin operates on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, and according to the algorithm, a halving must occur every 210,000 blocks until all 21 million Bitcoins are mined. It is estimated that the next Bitcoin halving will happen in 2028.
To alter this pre-set algorithm, a majority of Bitcoin miners, more than 50 percent, must agree, which is nearly impossible given Bitcoin's decentralized and extensive network.
Currently, around 19 million Bitcoins have already been mined, leaving only 2 million more to be mined.
The halving of Bitcoin supply has a significant impact on the cryptocurrency's price. Historically, it has been one of the major price drivers, with Bitcoin prices surging around the event. The event affects Bitcoin miners' operations, as a reduction in the reward by half without a corresponding significant price increase, affects the cash flow of the mining operations.

Shiba Inu Establishes Support At $0.00001
 
Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that over 397,000 Shiba Inu addresses currently in the money bought the meme coin at an average price of $0.000010. Meanwhile, the minimum price for those buy orders is $0.000008, while the maximum is $0.000014.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Ethereum transaction fees have taken a notable hit recently. The “transaction fees” here refer to the average fees (in USD) that senders on the ETH network are currently attaching to their transfers.
 
This metric’s value generally reflects the traffic conditions the blockchain is witnessing. When many users are making moves on the network, the average fees tend to go up.

Bitcoin Rewards Slashed, Not Supply
 
Ahead of the halving, misconceptions abound. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao recently clarified that the halving doesn’t mirror a stock split, which increases the total number of shares.
 
In contrast, the halving reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation, effectively tightening supply. This scarcity is a core principle behind the crypto asset’s design, aimin…]]></summary>
