A representative for Pertsev disclosed that the Dutch Court of Appeal of’s-Hertogenbosch has decided that he must remain in custody.
 
Pertsev’s attorneys had requested for their client to be released on house arrest so he may adequately prepare his appeal, but a Dutch court has now denied that request and decided to keep him under custody.
