Data compiled by Bloomberg reveals that on May 3, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust received approximately $63 million in net inflows. This comes after net outflows totaling around $17.4 billion since the trust’s conversion.

Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Have Been On The Decline Recently
 
As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a post on X, the BTC exchange inflows have been heading down for a while now. The “exchange inflow” is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin the investors deposit to wallets attached to centralized exchanges.
 
 
When this metric’s value is high, it means that holders are transferring a large number of coins to these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons why investors might deposit coins in the exchanges’ custody is for selling purposes, this kind of trend can be bearish for the asset.
