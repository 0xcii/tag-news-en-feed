Founder and CEO of Xverse, Ken Liao, expressed his enthusiasm for the funding, noting, "This seed funding sends a strong signal for Bitcoin, the most decentralized and secure settlement layer." This infusion of capital bolsters Xverse's trajectory, particularly its focus on advancing DeFi, Lightning Network, and other Bitcoin scalability solutions.
Xverse, which boasts seamless compatibility with Ordinals and BRC-20 inscriptions, has witnessed a big year of growth and momentum. Garnering more than 350,000 downloads across iOS, Android, and Chrome extensions. In the ongoing pursuit of mainstream adoption, the start up focuses on the "critical touchpoint" that user experience plays.
The Bitcoin wallet has also become the first Ordinals-focused wallet to introduce cold-storage security options for both Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, in a move to ensure user assets remain safe.
