        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was back in the green on Friday, with prices once again moving above the $17,000 level. Cryptocurrencies were mostly higher in today’s session, as prices rebounded from recent losses. Ethereum also surged earlier in the day, climbing closer to the $1,300 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) climbed higher in today’s session, with the coin surging back above the $17,000 level.
 
Following a low of $16,788.78 on Thursday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $17,274.60 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw bitcoin rally beyond its resistance level at $17,200, hitting a five-day high in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, BTC has since retreated from earlier highs, as bullish momentum faded soon after the breakout.
 
As of writing, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 50.93, which is marginally below a ceiling at 52.00.
 
Should the index continue to move higher, then the next target for bulls will likely be the $17,600 point.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also edged higher in today’s session, with prices rebounding from recent losses.
 
ETH/USD moved to a peak of $1,286.23 on Friday, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,227.50 during Thursday’s session.
 
As a result of today’s move, the coin neared a key resistance level of $1,305, rising to its highest point since Monday in the process.
 
 
Currently, it appears as though ethereum bulls are targeting a move beyond the $1,300 mark, however a ceiling on the RSI seems to be in the way.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 52.00, which has also been a key point of resistance in the past.
 
Bulls would need to overcome this hurdle first, in order to send prices towards the targeted $1,300 level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Bitcoiners are people who, like me, have escaped a cult: the cult of fiat.”
This is an opinion editorial by Jonathan Leger, a software developer and author of the Regarding Bitcoin newsletter. A version of this article was originally published on Substack.
I was raised in a doomsday cult that taught that God was getting ready to wage the war of Armageddon and bring about the end of the current world order. The governments, all ruled by the devil, would be replaced with the Kingdom of Heaven ruled by Jesus Christ. The cult discouraged any kind of real financial planning because of this worldview. After all, what was the point of investing in a system facing imminent destruction? 
This extreme religious upbringing — and my eventual escape from it — helped me in my path to understanding Bitc…]]></summary>

Until now, it was unclear which Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) would be included in the upgrade.
 
Most notably, there was controversy at the last meeting over whether proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) would be included to improve the scalability of layer 2 rollups.
 
However, as Tim Beiko from the Ethereum Foundation reports, consensus has now been reached.
 
EIP-4844 is not scheduled until the fall of 2023 with a separate hard fork, meaning the Shanghai upgrade will not be delayed and can remain on the tentative March 2023 schedule.

This year, over the first few days of the month, the maiden digital coin is changing hands at a median value of $17,030.
 
At the time of this writing, BTC, according to the latest data from Coingecko, is trading at $17,210, increasing in value by 2.4% over the last 24 hours.
 
The digital asset is now -65.9% on its year-to-date performance and has already lost 75% of its all-time-high value of $69,044 that was attained in November 10, 2021.
 
Still, even with its significantly lowered value, Bitcoin, according to some analysts and experts, still has the capability to surge all the way up to the $100K territory.
