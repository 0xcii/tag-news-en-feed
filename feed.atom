        <updated>2023-07-17T15:37:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has successfully integrated Bitcoin (BTC) onto the Lightning Network, enabling faster and more efficient transactions. As of today, users can now deposit and withdraw Bitcoin (BTC) using the Lightning Network on the Binance platform.
The integration of Bitcoin on the Lightning Network marks a significant milestone for Binance, as it aims to enhance the speed and scalability of Bitcoin transactions. By leveraging the Lightning Network, Binance aims to address the scalability challenges associated with the Bitcoin network, allowing users to enjoy faster and cheaper transactions. Previously, Binance has experienced issues in high fee environments, most recently highlighted when Bitcoin inscriptions caused a surge in fees. 
With the Lightning Network integration, Binance users can now take advantage of the Lightning Network's off-chain payment channels to send and receive bitcoin transactions with reduced fees and faster settlement times. This development comes just as Lightning is being integrated into other exchange platforms, essentially becoming an expectation for quick and easy bitcoin transactions. Just last week, a European exchange named Coinfinity also integrated the Lightning Network, with plans for further integration down the road. 
According to the official announcement by Binance, users can find their assigned bitcoin deposit addresses on the Lightning Network within the Deposit Crypto page on the platform. The exchange has also provided a FAQ section to guide users on how to deposit bitcoin using the Lightning Network.
The integration of the Lightning Network for bitcoin transactions is expected to bring tangible benefits to Binance users, offering them a faster and more cost-effective way to engage with the leading cryptocurrency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Geyser, a leading Bitcoin grant organization, has announced the launch of its fifth Bitcoin grant, aimed at supporting educational initiatives and community-based programs focused on Bitcoin. The grant opens up opportunities for campaigns that promote and bolster Bitcoin schools and communities worldwide. 
Mick Morucci, CEO of Geyser, emphasized the importance of Bitcoin for underserved populations, stating, "These are the people that would most benefit from bitcoin, which can act as a shield. These are also those that are least aware of bitcoin." The grant seeks to amplify the efforts of Bitcoin communities that are emerging across the globe, offering knowledge, education and tools to promote participation in the Bitcoin movement.

Initially, at a mere 2% to 5% in late June, the disparity sharply soared to an astonishing 16% by mid-July. Even though bitcoin lingered just above $30,000 on Monday, its valuation on Binance US is roughly $5,000 lower than the worldwide average in relation to the USD pair.

At the week’s start, the digital economy suffered a downturn with a 1.22% drop in value, reducing it to $1.2 trillion.

The FSB brings together regulators from around two dozen jurisdictions, including the US, EU, China, and the UK, and this framework is intended to provide guidance and promote consistency in the regulation of crypto assets across different jurisdictions.
 
The Financial Stability Board’s guidelines for regulating crypto assets are based on the principle of “same activity, same risk, same regulation,” and were developed in consultation with the G20 countries, an intergovernmental forum consisting of 19 countries and the European Union.

According to the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, crowd calls for a “bear market” and “bull market” can work as indicators for where the BTC price may be headed next.
 
The relevant metric here is the “social volume,” which measures the total number of text documents (that is, posts, threads, and other forms of text messages) on the major social media platforms that are making mentions of a given term or topic.
 
This indicator only counts the unique number of text documents, meaning that it doesn’t care about how many mentions a specific post may contain the term in question, only that it …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week trading around the $30,000 mark, as the cryptocurrency market continued to consolidate following last week’s gains. The global market was down 1.19% at the time of writing, as sentiment remains uncertain following a weekend of profit taking. Ethereum was also down on Monday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) narrowly avoided a drop below the $30,000 level on Monday, as market sentiment remained uncertain following recent gains.
 
BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $30,045.23 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after peaking at $30,437.56.
 
Some expected prices to drop this week, after last week’s rally pushed volumes deep into overbought territory.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
The relative strength index (RSI), which reached a high of 66.00 last week, now sits at the 52.85 mark.
 
This is marginally above a floor at 52.00, which seems to have been the last line of defense preventing BTC from falling under $30,000.
 
As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $30,201.14.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also moved lower on Monday, however traders were once again able to prevent price from dropping below the $1,900 level.
 
Following a high of $1,942.03 during Sunday’s session, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,901.06 to start the week.
 
This resulted in the world’s second largest cryptocurrency falling lower for a fourth consecutive day.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Since reaching a multi-month high at $2,029, sellers and profit takers have moved to push price lower.
 
Similar to BTC, this was due to price strength being overbought, with a reading above the 70.00 mark. However, it now sits at 52.94.
 
The next visible floor appears to be at 50.00, and should it reach this point, ethereum will likely be trading below $1,900.

“Bitcoin is not for everyone.” It's a bold statement that may seem counterintuitive when the goal is mass adoption. After all, shouldn't we aim to convince everyone about the benefits of Bitcoin? Well, the truth is, we can't. And that's okay.
In our world, it's easy to live within a filter bubble, surrounded by like-minded plebs who reinforce our beliefs. But when we attempt to market Bitcoin to the masses, we quickly realize that not everyone shares our enthusiasm. The resounding chorus of "no" can be disheartening, and there are many examples of people claiming to “give up” on orange-pilling normies.

Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, briefly reached a new yearly high at $31,840, although it was unable to sustain the bullish breakout. Despite encouraging US economic data, profit-taking prevailed during the last trading day of the week.
