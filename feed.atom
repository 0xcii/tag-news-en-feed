Looking at this agenda, this year’s stacked lineup should be able to provide some signal amidst the electoral chatter. To warm us up for what promises to be an absolute marathon of an event, I’ve highlighted a handful of topics and talks to keep an eye on.

Bitcoiners have had their lives upended, their perspectives shifted, and their value systems altered. We see how our behavior changed from our pre-Bitcoin selves, our emphasis now squarely placed on real things, hard things, the long term, and the local. We look to our inner selves, and we look after ourselves. We see to our families. We set our own house in order before we criticize the world…]]></summary>
