Speaking with Digital Perspectives, Jones elaborated on her predictions about the company’s future, particularly focusing on its pre-IPO share value.
 
Pre-IPO Shares Have The Potential For A 2000% Rise
 
She began her analysis by referencing the current valuation of pre-IPO shares on Linqto, a platform for private investing. “According to Linqto, at $35 a share, which is slightly under $34 today on the Linqto website, that is a $5.7 billion valuation for Ripple stock,” Jones stated. This figure, she noted, is notably lower than the enterprise’s past buyback at a valuation of $15 billion.
