the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by trading volume, in the past  
week has been reaching out to digital asset projects on its  
platform with  
smaller market capitalization and low-liquidity tokens. 
According  
to The Block, which first reported the news, the exchange has been asking about  
the market makers associated with these projects. Binance is also asking if the  
projects would be open to allocating up to 5% of their circulating tokens into  
its savings pools in exchange for interest earnings. 
A Race for More Volume?
While the  
move appears to be targeted at boosting trading volumes on Binance, a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin marginally declined during Friday’s session, concurrent with the ongoing Federal Reserve symposium in Jackson Hole. The Chair of the Fed, Jerome Powell will be speaking at the annual meeting, and providing guidance on the upcoming policy decision. Ethereum also consolidated today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin briefly fell below the $26,000 level on Friday, as traders readied themselves for Jerome Powell’s speech.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,914.93 earlier in the day, following a high of $26,406.15 on Thursday.
 
The decline saw bitcoin move one step closer to its recent support point of $25,600, a level it has tracked for most of the week.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 
From the chart, the decline comes after the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) was unable to move beyond a ceiling of 30.00 during yesterday’s session.
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 25.89, which remains highly oversold, and could be heading even lower, to a floor of 20.00.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also slipped today, as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moved below a recent price floor.
 
After trading at a high of $1,668.82 on Thursday, ETH/USD bottomed out at $1,641.63 earlier in the day.
 
This resulted in ETH sliding below a support level at $1,650, which has proven to be a zone of high volatility.

Similar to BTC above, today’s drop comes after the RSI collided with a resistance point of 33.00 on Thursday.
 
The index now sits at a reading of 30.66, with the next floor over 10.00 points away.

The breach, reported on Friday, has led to the compromise of non-sensitive customer data belonging to specific claimants. 
 
While FTX asserts that its core operations remain unaffected, the incident has raised concerns about the security of personal information within the crypto industry.
 
FTX wasted no time in addressing the breach and reassuring its customers. The exchange promptly announced that its own account passwords, systems, and funds had not been compromised.
 
 
The crypto exchange remains vigilant, actively monitoring the situation while collaborating with Kroll to contain the aftermath. It is important to note that the breach has not …]]></summary>

During an interview with Corey Costa, Hoskinson suggested that the agency’s crackdown on the industry was politically motivated.

Ripple And SEC Trial “Won’t Happen”
 
Rispoli’s assertion revolves around the SEC’s initial strategy. He stated, “It’s painfully obvious that suing those two initially was only to pressure Ripple into a weak settlement position.” This suggests that the SEC’s move might have been more tactical than substantive, aiming to corner Ripple into a position of vulnerability rather than genuinely seeking justice.
