Altcoins Will Make A Move In The Summer
 
Van de Poppe mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that altcoins are ready for their upward run and will see a lot of momentum from late June until September or October. The crypto analyst added that these altcoins will reprice back to their normal values when this move occurs, alluding to the “big cascade” they have suffered since the start of the year.

The digital currency trades at around $71,000, a 50% increase since the ETFs’ inception but short of setting a new record high.
 
Charles Edwards, CEO of Capriole Investments, shared insights via a post on X addressing the community’s burning question: “Why aren’t we at $100,000 yet?” According to Edwards, the answer lies in several key factors beyond just the ETF inflows.

Then, quicker than a leg drop off the top turnbuckle, Hogan’s posts promoting HULK vanished into thin air, taking the token’s value with them.
