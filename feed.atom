        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is no secret that the bitcoin mining industry is being battle-tested in the wake of the fourth halving. Hash price (revenue per terrahash) has reached historic lows as bitcoin’s block subsidy has been slashed.

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 91.94%
 
In a surprising turn of events, the Shiba Inu burn rate has seen a significant decline of 91.94%. This drop comes in the last 24 hours, underscoring the lack of attention to this metric, as well as the conservative stance that investors have taken during this time.
 
 
According to the Shiba Inu burn tracking website, Shibburn, there were only 2.367 million SHIB tokens burned in the last day. This is in stark contrast to the 29.5 million that were burned the prior day. Also, looking at the burn rates from this…]]></summary>

traders to replicate expert trading strategies. The new feature enables users

Up to 10 Lead Traders
This development followed the launch of Binance’s

trader and allocate investment funds. It enables users to diversify their

Over 16,000 BTC Left The Coinbase Platform In The Past Day
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, Coinbase has observed a huge outflow for the seventh time this year. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “exchange outflow,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin leaving the wallets attached to a centralized exchange.
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means that the investors are currently withdrawing large amounts from the platform in question. Generally, holders take their coins out of the custody of these central entities whenever they plan to hold onto them for extended periods.

This recommendation follows despite MSTR’s notable year-to-date performance of 85%, compared to Bitcoin’s 125% gain.
 
 
Cramer’s endorsement, however, is met with a dose of skepticism. The financial guru is known for his sometimes-inaccurate predictions, with some even claiming his recommendations have the opposite effect – a phenomenon known as the “Inverse Cramer” theory.
