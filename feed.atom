How Ethereum Is A Scam
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bit Paine gave his view on Ethereum and other altcoins in what he termed “a brief history of the rise and fall of ethereum.” He seemed to be alluding to the Ethereum network when he spoke about a “world computer,” which he labeled a scam.
 
 
According to him, this world computer only succeeded, despite being a scam, because of “one very potent use case,” which is that it provided a platform for anyone to easily create and sell “digital penny stock” (which he also referred to as unregistered s…]]></summary>

This discussion came in response to fellow pro-XRP attorney John E. Deaton’s comment: “The people who’ve argued that the SEC got a 50-50 victory in the Ripple case are 100% wrong. It was more like 90-10 in Ripple’s favor. If Ripple ends up paying $20M or less it’s a 99.9% legal victory.”

This decline was not only a reflection of the typical pattern seen with many fleeting trends but also a testament to the evolving nature of the crypto market. 
 
As the hype surrounding NFTs began to subside, Ethereum, the prominent platform that had fostered the growth of these digital collectibles, experienced a correlated downturn in activity.
 
The recent resurgence in the daily volume of ETH NFTs, however, has sparked new hope for the future of this sector. An analysis of current data indicates a slight but notable increase in the trading activity of Ethereum-based NFTs, pointing towards a potential…]]></summary>
