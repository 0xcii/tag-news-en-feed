New Bitcoin Mini Trust Debuts
 
According to Bloomberg, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, which debuted with a 0.15% expense ratio, is the lowest-cost exchange-traded product holding Bitcoin in the US market, edging out even the recently launched Bitcoin ETFs from industry giants like BlackRock and Fidelity.
