However, following this new ATH, BTC has experienced a significant price correction, hitting a low of $60,900 on Tuesday, March 19th. The main factors contributing to this downturn are the increased selling activity of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and a decline in demand for the new investment vehicles approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10th.
