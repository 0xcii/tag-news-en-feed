The crypto founder was found guilty of all seven charges after co-mingling his clients’ funds with that of his trading arm, Alameda Research. Billions of dollars were lost, which led SBF to jail. However, only now do his victims and the public get a glimpse into his life in prison.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last May, I wrote an article for Bitcoin Magazine predicting that Layer 2 (L2) metaprotocol solutions would resolve the Ordinals controversy. Now that two of the most highly-anticipated Layer 2 solutions, Taproot Assets (TA) and RGB, are either available or imminent, it’s time to revisit this subject. Indeed, it may be past time judging by recent fee spikes driven by a resurgence of interest in BRC-20 tokens...
Following my view that the price, fee, and flexibility advantages offered by L2 metaprotocol solutions over on-chain Ordinals will ultimately prove decisive, I’ve focused my energies on advancing such solutions. Over the last few months, I’ve been deeply involved in both TA and RGB projects. In early September, I established a group in which the developers of L2 metaprotocol wallets…]]></summary>

Altcoins May Be Overbought Currently As Trader Profits Have Shot Up
 
In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed how the altcoins as a whole have been observing high profits recently based on the MVRV ratio.
 
The “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio” is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the market cap and realized cap for any given cryptocurrency.
 
The “realized cap” here refers to a capitalization model that assumes the real value of any token in circulation is not the current spot price of the asset, but rather the value at which it was last moved on the blockchain.

Snowden didn’t categorically affirm or deny whether he was Satoshi while responding to this speculation about him being the Bitcoin founder.
