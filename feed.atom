        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-rebounds-on-thursday-following-microstrategys-latest-purchase/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-29T13:09:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rebounded on Thursday, as markets reacted to the news that Microstrategy bought an additional $374 million worth of the cryptocurrency. Michael Saylor’s firm now has 152,333 bitcoin, worth roughly $4.52 billion. Ethereum moved closer to $1,900 on the news.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) edged higher in today’s session, after it was confirmed that Michael Saylor’s Microstrategy purchased 12,333 BTC.
 
Following the news, BTC/USD hit a high of $30,740.79, which comes after the price bottomed out at $29,921.82 the day prior.
 
Today’s rally has seen BTC briefly break out of a resistance level at the $30,700 mark, however bulls are struggling to sustain this.
 
 
At the the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $30,678.73, with the relative strength index (RSI) nearing a ceiling of its own at 68.00.
 
Price strength is now at 67.02, with earlier bulls seemingly opting to secure some gains as the aforementioned resistance looms.
 
In the event this zone is breached, there is a good chance the price will rise over the $31,000 mark.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) marginally rose on Thursday, after bouncing from a key support point.
 
ETH/USD jumped to an intraday peak at $1,874.01 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after settling at a low of $1,822.10.
 
Bulls rejected a breakout below a floor at $1,820, and have now instead begun to push price towards the $1,900 mark.
 
 
This started after the RSI rose above a resistance level at 53.00. It is currently tracking at 54.81.
 
As a result, bullish momentum has also heightened, with the 10-day (red) moving average extending its upward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
If this trend continues, ETH will likely hit $1,930 momentarily.

On January 4, 2023 (block 770,402, for those of you keeping score at home), the Chief Lightning Officers (CLO) was created. 
What started out as a small group of voluntary plebs has blossomed into roughly 50 Bitcoiners engaging in bi-weekly calls with the intent to arm each other with all of the necessary tools and skills to further Lightning adoption at the local level. The plebs that make up the group have wide-ranging skill sets across multiple industries, such as education, finance and information technology, in addition to holding blue-collar jobs. This grassroots movement has lofty goals. As early member Mark Maraia stated in an interview for this arti…]]></summary>

The year 2022 saw a significant rise in the prevalence of these fraudulent schemes, with a massive $7.8 billion being paid out to cryptocurrency pyramid and Ponzi schemes globally, as revealed in a report by blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs.

However, the regulatory actions led by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler have not gone without criticism from various participants in the industry.
 
Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, in particular, has expressed discontentment with Gensler’s regulatory approach. In a recent CNBC interview, Clayton referred to Gensler’s statement, “If we’re not losing cases, we aren’t suing enough businesses,” and interpreted it as a notable shift in the public’s perception of the government’s role.

Tokenizing Real-World Assets
 
According to Shaame, the ease with which anyone (including scammers) is able to generate a certificate of authenticity for an NFT only further highlights the importance of having such an authenticating entity. In addition to using tools such as digital notaries, the co-founder of Wakweli — a Layer-1 protocol that issues certificates of authenticity for NFTs & real-world assets — said NFT users must learn to do their own research.

Investment Management (ARK Invest), owned by popular investor Cathie Wood.

When asked by crypto enthusiast David Hoffman, Buterin conveyed his dissatisfaction with individuals who solely perceive tokenization as the primary breakthrough in cryptocurrencies. 
 
While acknowledging that tokenization has facilitated the emergence of fresh economic models and democratized the accessibility to financial instruments, Buterin seems to argue that such a narrow perspective undermines the wider scope of the technology’s potential. 
 
Can we truly appreciate the profound impact of cryptocurrencies if we limit their significance to just tokenization?
