        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase has listed Paypal’s PYUSD stablecoin, following an announcement of its support for the digital asset just a day earlier. Should liquidity requirements be satisfied, the exchange plans to introduce trading pairs for the asset in stages.
 
Coinbase Adds PYUSD Stablecoin
 
Coinbase, the prominent cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in San Francisco, has incorporated Paypal’s dollar-tied token, PYUSD, into its offerings. The firm broke the news on Wednesday, mentioning that trading would commence at 9 a.m. PT on Thursday, provided “liquidity conditions were met.”
 
“Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our PYUSD-USD trading pairs will launch in phases,” elaborated Coinbase. “Support for PYUSD may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions.” The exchange also emphasized that PYUSD operates as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network, cautioning users against transferring the asset through alternate networks to avoid potential losses.
 

 
According to a recent Bitcoin.com News report, PYUSD’s supply experienced a spike leaping from 26.9 million to 43.3 million PYUSD. However, despite the recent addition to Coinbase, PYUSD’s activity remains limited, recording merely 1,587 transfers and boasting 388 holders. As of 12:30 p.m. ET on August 31, the exchange’s web portal says PYUSD can be acquired via Coinbase.
 
 
Our report on PYUSD highlighted that other digital currency platforms, such as Crypto.com, Uniswap, Gate.io, Bitmart, and Bybit, also support the token. On Thursday specifically, a labeled Coinbase wallet possesses around 1,005,467 PYUSD, ranking it as the fifth-largest PYUSD wallet as of August 31. This means the Coinbase wallet accounts for approximately 2.3221% of the total supply of Paypal’s stablecoin token.

Bill Morgan, an attorney representing Ripple in its protracted legal battle with the SEC, has been vocal about the evolving judicial stance on crypto. His recent comments underline a changing tide in the interpretation of digital assets and a seeming divergence from the SEC’s traditionally stringent perspective.

The international entity has been experimenting with blockchain technology, both private and public networks, and finally revealed the progress of its efforts.
 
 
Chainlink To Improve International Payment Rails?
 
Per an official statement, SWIFT claims that its infrastructure can “seamlessly” integrate with blockchain technology to enable users to transfer “tokenized value” across multiple networks. In that way, the international monetary system aims to reduce friction from these transfers and allow the tokenized asset markets to “scale globally.”

During this period, clients and users faced a lot of difficulties gaining access to their funds as Patricia froze all withdrawals in its platform and provided a statement to assure its worried users about the situation of their funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin stayed close to a two-week high on Thursday, as markets rebounded from a slight sell-off during yesterday’s session. Traders moved to secure profits over the last 24 hours, following strong gains on Tuesday. Solana neared a drop below $20.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) remained close to a multi-week high during today’s session, as bulls attempted to maintain recent pressure.
 
After sliding to a low of $0.06468 on Wednesday, DOGE/USD moved to a peak of $0.06692 earlier today.
 
This was marginally below Tuesday’s high of $0.0687, which is the strongest level the meme coin had hit since mid-August.
 
 
Bullish momentum has eased in recent days since the relative strength index (RSI) collided with a resistance level of 48.00.
 
Price strength has since tailed off, and at the time of writing this is now tracking at the 45.92 mark.
 
Should a break out of the aforementioned ceiling take place in the coming days, bulls will likely attempt to take the price above $0.0700.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
On the other hand, solana (SOL) extended a recent losing streak on Thursday, with the price moving closer to a drop below $20.00.
 
SOL/USD bottomed out at $20.55 earlier in today’s session, which comes following a high of $21.01 the day prior.
 
The recent shift in sentiment comes as solana bulls were unable to orchestrate a move beyond a resistance level of $22.
 
 
It now seems inevitable that the token will fall to a floor at $20, depending on where the RSI lands.
 
As of writing this, the index is at a reading of 41.73, with a support point of 39.00 a possible target for sellers.
 
Solana could drop under the $20.00 level in the not-too-distant future, in the event this floor is hit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin edged lower once again on Thursday, as traders continued to capture profits following gains on Tuesday. The latest drop followed data revealing U.S. gross domestic product growth in the second quarter that undershot expectations. Ethereum likewise declined, dipping under $1,700.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was in the red for a second consecutive session, as a mixture of profit-taking and general bearish sentiment impacted price.
 
Following a peak of $27,490.77 on hump day, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,069.21 earlier today.
 
The sell-off comes a few days removed from bitcoin moving above $28,000, following Grayscale’s court win against the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC).
 
 
On a technical note, the decline coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failing to move beyond its ceiling at 53.00.
 
As of writing this, the index is now tracking at a reading of 47.50, with the next visible floor at the 43.00 level.
 
Should momentum push price strength to this point, there is a good chance that the price will drop below $27,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) was back in the red on Thursday, with price falling below the $1,700 level.
 
ETH/USD dropped to the bottom of $1,697.15 earlier in the day, which comes following a high of $1,721.62 the day prior.
 
Like with bitcoin, the decline appears to be a result of profit-taking, after ethereum surged to a multi-week high on Tuesday.
 
 
In order for bulls to maintain the momentum from earlier in the week, a breakout will need to occur at the 49.00 level on the RSI.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 45.65, with price back above $1,700.
