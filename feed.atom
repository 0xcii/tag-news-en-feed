        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday’s Federal Reserve (FED) FOMC meeting turned out to be more hawkish than many Bitcoin investors and the financial market expected. As anticipated, the FED raised interest rates by 0.5 percentage points on Wednesday. This brings the interest rate to a range of 4.25-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years.
 
However, overall, central bankers expect the rate to be higher next year than initially expected, which may have been the biggest influencing factor in yesterday’s bitcoin and crypto market reaction.
 
FED Is More Hawkish Than Expected
 
The revision to the FOMC dot plot showed that, on average, the monetary policymakers expect to raise the rate up to 5.1% in 2023 before lowering it to 4.1% in 2024. That means the Fed will have to raise the fed funds rate another 0.75 bps in 2023. W…]]></summary>

The crypto community and regulators are wondering what led to the abrupt downfall of the cryptocurrency exchange, which just this February was valued at $32 billion.

“Mr. Wonderful” O’Leary, formerly the mouthpiece for the FTX, was heavily invested in the disgraced crypto exchange.
