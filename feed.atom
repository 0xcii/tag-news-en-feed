SEC Could Appeal Court’s Ruling
 
In an interview with Henri Arslanian, the host of the Future of Money Podcast, Clayton hinted that the Commission could appeal Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling. While commenting on how the court ruled that programmatic sales didn’t qualify as securities, he alluded to whether or not the appellate court would reach a similar conclusion upon appeal.

The Land of the Rising Sun, often associated with resilience, has paved the way for a comprehensive stablecoin framework, setting itself apart as a global leader in navigating the complexities of the crypto landscape.
A Resilient Approach
Japan's regulatory journey, shaped by the fallout from the Coincheck hack in 2018, has been marked by resilience. While other nations may have hesitated, Japan's regulatory approach proved pivotal in safeguarding user assets during the FTX collapse in November 2022. The requirement for crypto exchanges to segregate assets showcased a robust stance, ensuring users could recover funds in a crisis.
