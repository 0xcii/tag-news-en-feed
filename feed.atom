This significant expenditure is primarily attributed to creating and moving tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using inscriptions, a novel method gaining traction in the blockchain world.
 
Inscriptions have emerged as a creative bypass on networks like Bitcoin, which lack native token support. By embedding text in standard blockchain transactions and employing an external numbering system, these inscription-based tokens offer a unique approach to token creation and movement.

Saga Phone Resurgence: BONK’s Rise Turns Solana Device Into Hot Commodity
 
The Solana Saga phone, once struggling to find its market, has seen its fortunes reversed this week, with units selling for as much as $5,000 on Ebay, a staggering increase from its discounted price earlier this summer. This dramatic shift in demand is primarily attributed to the explosive rise of the Solana-based meme coin, BONK, which experienced more than a 10,000% surge in the past two months.
 
The Saga phone, initially released earlier this year with a price tag of $1,000 and later reduced to $599, had faced disappointi…]]></summary>

“JPEGs” Is Good: Will Force Innovation And Adoption Of Layer-2s
 
Central to Back’s arguments lies the recently rising cost of transacting on the mainnet. Though the most valuable, Bitcoin has remained unchanged, especially on throughput, for the last 15 years.

In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst explained a relationship between the BTC spot price and the 365-day moving average (MA) and 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio.
