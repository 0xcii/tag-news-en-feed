The platform, shortly after its launch, encountered an unexpected halt in block production owing to an immense surge in traffic.
 
The lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, elucidated on this setback, mentioning a “massive influx of transactions and users” that immediately ensued upon the network going live, pushing it offline. Highlighting the extent of the traffic deluge, Kusama referred to data from the Web3 development platform Alchemy.
 
The data revealed that while Shibarium had a monthly allocation of 400 million compute units, a whopping 160+ million units were used up in just under half an hour. Nevertheless, the technical glitch…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s mining difficulty hit a record high after increasing 5.48% to 57.12 trillion. This rise signifies the need for a significant amount of computational power to discover blocks. Meanwhile, the network’s hashrate also reached a record high this past week.
 
Bitcoin Difficulty Jumps to 57 Trillion, Hashrate Spikes to Fresh New Highs
 
On September 19, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain recorded a 5.48% difficulty increase at block 808,416. This change followed the prior difficulty adjustment, which saw a 2.65% drop at block 806,400 on September 5. With the difficulty set at 57.12 trillion, it represents the toughest period ever for bitcoin mining.
 
The subsequent difficulty adjustment is anticipated on October 2, 2023. Since the surge to 57 trillion, the hashrate remains elevated, with current block times averaging nine minutes and 33 seconds.
 
 
Over the last month, the hashrate’s 30-day simple moving average (SMA) stood at 402 exahash per second (EH/s). The seven-day SMA reports 432 EH/s, while the three-day SMA shows a peak of 461 EH/s.
 
 
The network also set a 24-hour record with a swift ascent to 538.88 EH/s at block 807,830 on September 15. Currently, the hashrate hovers around 425.16 EH/s, with about 42 entities contributing SHA256 hashrate to the network.
 
The Foundry USA mining pool leads with 123.92 EH/s, accounting for 29.19% of the hashrate over the last three days. Antpool provides 95.25 EH/s or 22.44% of the total hashrate, while F2pool contributes 57.33 EH/s or 13.51% as of Tuesday.
