        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Blockchain Life 2023 event in Dubai, Microbt rolled out its latest Whatsminer M60 series, which boasts an efficiency rating of 18.5 joules per terahash (J/T).
 
Whatsminer M60 Series Showcased in Dubai
 
On Tuesday, at the Blockchain Life 2023 conference in Dubai, Microbt showcased three next-generation miners from its M60 series. The firm had teased this launch in mid-September, hinting that the machines would feature enhanced efficiency.
 
The M60 series includes an air-cooled variant, a hydro-cooled version, and an immersion-cooled model, each delivering an impressive efficiency of 18.5 J/T. The air-cooled M60S clocks in at 170 to 186 terahash per second (TH/s), whereas the hydro-cooled M63S ranges from 360 to 390 TH/s.
 
 
Dubbed the M66, the immersion-cooled miner churns out a notable 270 to 298 TH/s. This unveiling aligns with recent releases from the top trio of mining rig producers, all of whom have amped up their efficiency metrics.
 
Bitmain’s new S21 models range from 16 J/T to 17.5 J/T, with hashrates spanning 200 TH/s to 335 TH/s. Canaan’s newest Avalon 14 has an efficiency metric of 19.5 J/T, exclusive to its hydro-cooled version.
 
 
The Avalon 14 air-cooled counterpart registers at 21.5 J/T. These fresh offerings, with their elevated hashrates and optimized efficiency, are poised to supercharge the network’s cumulative hashrate.
 
As of October 23, 2023, Bitcoin’s seven-day simple moving average hashrate is coasting along at 452 exahash per second (EH/s). As bitcoin’s value surged this week, the network’s hash value, priced per petahash per second (PH/s), climbed to $72 per PH/s daily.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to reports, the operators of a Central African Republic (CAR) crypto company which promised a high return on money invested have disappeared along with $1.6 million in investor funds. High-profile personalities including lawmakers and senior government employees are among the hundreds of CAR residents who fell victim to the apparent scam.
 
Company Abruptly Closes Shop
 
The operators of a Central African Republic (CAR)-based cryptocurrency investment company, Clé du Succès, are accused of defrauding investors of approximately $1.6 million or one billion CFA francs, a report has said. The company, which only began its operations in September, is said to have abruptly closed shop on Oct. 8 leaving both investors and employees uncertain about the fate of their investments and jobs.
 
According to a report, Clé du Succès, which is a duly registered company and has been issued with a tax identification number, lured prospective investors with the promise of a 20% return on investment. The report added that some victims of the apparent scam had invested their life savings.
 
Consequently, the police have launched an investigation into the operations of Clé du Succès which is being overseen by the Research and Investigation Section (SRI).
 
 

Meanwhile, the report revealed that high-profile personalities are among the hundreds of CAR residents who fell victim to Clé du Succès’ scam. Such high-profile personalities include unnamed lawmakers, senior government employees, and traders.
 
While the CAR is the first country in Africa to declare bitcoin a legal tender, a court ruling and the subsequent repeal of the bitcoin law ultimately helped to unravel the achievements made by President Faustin-Archange Touadéra’s government. As per the report, a repeal of the law means CAR crypto investors who fall victim to scams similar to the one pulled off by Clé du Succès have no legal recourse.

In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, the Mexican billionaire underscored why people should consider adopting Bitcoin as a store of value over banks. His reasoning was that these financial institutions secretly take people’s savings without their permission.
