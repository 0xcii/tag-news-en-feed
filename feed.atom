        <updated>2023-05-09T17:11:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canadian Bitcoin exchange, Bull Bitcoin, has launched a new no-KYC (know-your-customer) service which enables users to buy bitcoin with cash or debit card. Users can go to any Canadian Post office, scan the QR code generated on the Bull Bitcoin app, and pay in cash or via debit card.
 
         
         
         
         
    
The funds are automatically added to the user's Bull Bitcoin account within a few minutes. Transactions of up to ~$745 ($999.99 CAD) can be made per transaction, with no KYC required. The exchange has a fee of 2% for no-KYC sats, the cheapest of any such service in Canada, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, while Bull Bitcoin's on-chain withdrawals remain free.
Canadian regulations state that Bitcoin exchanges must perform KYC and keep transaction records for all purchases above $1,000 CAD. Bull Bitcoin states that its privacy policy complies with the fair information principles in the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act (PIPEDA), which prevents it from collecting information that is not needed for a legitimate purpose. 
With no risk of chargeback for cash and debit card transactions, the company states that it has no legitimate reason to ask for KYC.
Bull Bitcoin aims to offer cash bitcoin purchases due to customer demand, and for those without access to bank accounts. The company also aims to attract migrant workers for remittances and users who want to limit the amount of personal information they give to trusted third parties. In addition, cash and debit card transactions are not subject to fraudulent chargebacks, unlike bank transfers and e-transfers. The process of funding accounts with cash or debit cards is also faster and more convenient.]]></summary>

The regulator also withdrew some licenses from VASPs. The outcome of such a move is yet unknown, but it’ll filter out the crypto businesses from the country.
 
Estonia Implemented New Crypto Regulatory Rules
 
The FIU released a statement regarding the impact of amendments on some regulatory laws in March 2023. The amendment cut across Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Terrorist Financing Prevention laws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, the Bitcoin community has been abuzz with discussions about the network’s scaling challenges. As the blockchain’s transfer fees continue to surge, the backlog of transactions stuck in the mempool has hit an unprecedented high. Crypto enthusiasts have been sharing their diverse perspectives on the matter, leading to a flurry of takes across various social media platforms.
 
Bitcoin’s Scaling Challenges Spark Controversy and Diverse Perspectives
 
The recent surge in Ordinals and BRC20 token usage has led to a significant increase in onchain activity, causing the mempool to overflow with over 400,000 transactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin network’s mempool remains clogged with 415,000 transactions waiting to be added to the blockchain. As Bitcoinist reported, Bitcoin Ordinals and the new BRC20 token standard are responsible for congestion on the Bitcoin network.
 
While supporters argue that BRC20 tokens are a groundbreaking innovation from which the network will benefit in the long run due to rising transaction fees to finance miners, critics see a DDoS attack as the mempool is flooded with low-value transactions, effectively to speculate with sh*tcoins.
 
Is Bitcoin Under Attack?
 
The latter party includes John W. Ratcliff, a renowned video game programmer and Bitcoin OG. Ratcliff wrote today via Twitter that based on the way BRC20 tokens are coded, it is clearly an attack on Bitcoin.

"There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>

And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>
