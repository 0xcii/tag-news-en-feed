        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite acting as twin forces for accelerating and adopting cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, have historically been at odds with each other due to the “L1 wars” and their vocal online proponents. To some, the rivalry may seem like a mere culture war within the crypto community. However at its’ root, it's a reflection of distinct foundational beliefs resulting in divergence.
Let's delve deeper into these foundational beliefs:
Bitcoin: A Beacon of Decentralization (and Liquidity)

        <updated>2023-09-20T18:35:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Wednesday, the payment giant Paypal announced that the stablecoin PYUSD is now available on Venmo. Paypal detailed that the stablecoin asset will be available to select Venmo users and fully roll out for all users “in the coming weeks.”
 
Paypal Stablecoin PYUSD Makes Its Way to Venmo
 
Paypal has disclosed that Venmo users can now leverage the firm’s proprietary stablecoin, PYUSD. The rollout is starting with select Venmo users, but soon all Venmo customers will be able to “able to purchase PYUSD and send it to friends and family on Paypal, Venmo, and compatible external wallets.”
 
The company notes that transfers between Paypal users and Venmo are “fast and free,” with the exception of blockchain network fees. PYUSD is an ERC20 token, which means the coin is subject to fees associated with the Ethereum fee market and block space.
 
For example, etherscan.io indicates that the cost to transfer an ERC20 token on September 20, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. (ET), ranges from $2.65 to $2.91 per transaction. Paypal further mentions in the announcement that PYUSD is now available on various platforms, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Kraken, MetaMask, Ledger, Phantom, Bitpay, and Fireblocks, among others.
 
The payments company also highlights its recent approval by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The latest development comes on the heels of PYUSD’s first transparency report, which unveiled the backing of cash and U.S. Treasury reverse repurchase agreements as reserves.
 
 
As of September 20, approximately 44.37 million PYUSD coins are in circulation. A total of 698 distinct addresses currently hold PYUSD, with these wallets collectively executing 3,354 transfers since the currency’s launch. Additionally, the top 100 holders jointly possess 99.96% of the PYUSD supply, equivalent to 44,358,474.05 PYUSD tokens.
 
What do you think about PYUSD being supported by Venmo? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A previously little-seen video of the late Hal Finney, a pioneering figure in the world of Bitcoin, has surfaced, shedding light on his groundbreaking work on cryptographic protocols, and giving a rare glimpse of his humanity.
In the video, recorded at the Crypto 98 conference, Finney is seen discussing zero-knowledge proofs, offering a glimpse of how many of the cutting-edge concepts still being tested for Bitcoin, are in fact, decades old.
"I want to prove to you that I know a message that hashes to a given hash value using the SHA-1 hash. I don't want to reveal anything about the message to you. It's a zero-knowledge proof, and I've written a program to do this that I'll tell you about," Finney says in the introduction.

Bitcoin Percent Supply On Exchanges Has Dropped To 11.8%
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, the BTC exchange supply is back to its year-to-date (YTD) lows. The relevant metric here is the “percent balance on exchanges,” which keeps track of the total percentage of the Bitcoin supply that’s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this indicator goes up, it means that the investors are depositing a net amount of the cryptocurrency into these platforms. As one of the main reasons why investors make such transfers is for selling purposes, this kind of trend can carry potential bearish effects for the coin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to David Hirsch, head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, more enforcement actions against firms that haven’t properly registered with the regulator are expected. Hirsch discussed crypto assets and exchanges Tuesday at an SEC forum in Chicago.
 
SEC Crypto Head Forewarns Tougher Enforcement
 
While the crypto community has focused on the XRP case and lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may target more violators soon. David Hirsch, head of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, made the statements, as reported by Coindesk.
 
On Tuesday at the Securities Enforcement Forum Central in Chicago, Hirsch said the SEC will “continue to bring those charges.”
 
“We’re going to continue to be active as to intermediaries,” Hirsch told the audience. “That can be brokers, dealers, exchanges, clearing agencies or any others who are active in this space, are within our jurisdiction and not meeting their obligations, either through registration or failure to provide adequate or complete disclosures.”
 
 
The SEC has cracked down on several high-profile crypto companies such as Binance, Bittrex US, and Coinbase. More recently it has been focused on a couple of non-fungible token (NFT) projects that raised millions without disclosure.
 
Hirsch insists more enforcement is coming. “We’re going to continue to conduct investigations, we’re gonna be active in the space, and adding the label of [decentralized finance] is not going to be something that’s going to deter us from continuing our work,” the SEC official remarked.
 
The SEC official noted the regulator has significant ongoing litigation. Beyond enforcement actions against exchanges and brokers, the market capitalization of crypto coins that the SEC claims are crypto securities stands at $85.4 billion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP was a big mover on Wednesday, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly consolidating in today’s session. Traders have moved to secure recent gains, ahead of September’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Polygon was also in the green, hitting a two-week high in the process.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was a notable gainer in today’s session, as the token raced to a multi-week high.
 
Following a low of $0.5092 on Tuesday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday peak at $0.5233 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the surge in price, XRP climbed to its highest point since August 31, when price peaked at $0.5285.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came as the relative strength index (RSI) broke free of a ceiling at 48.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 50.66, with bulls possibly targeting a ceiling at 58.00.
 
In the event traders reach this target, there is a strong chance XRP will move above $0.5500.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
In addition to XRP, polygon (MATIC) also surged to a multi-week high on Wednesday, despite market uncertainty ahead of the Fed announcement.
 
MATIC/USD peaked at $0.5486 earlier in today’s session, after rebounding from a low of $0.536 the day before.
 
The move pushed polygon to its strongest level since September 8, when the token reached a high of $0.5586.
 
 
Earlier gains have since faded, and this appears to be due to the RSI failing to break out of its ceiling at the 49.00 mark.
 
Currently, price strength sits at 47.34, however momentum remains largely bullish, ahead of a potential moving average crossover.
 
The 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) trend lines are on the cusp of an upwards cross, which could trigger a fresh price surge.
