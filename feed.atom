        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto exchange platform OKX launched OKX  
Futures on December 15, 2023. This move, aimed at refining its derivatives  
trading platform, promised to streamline the exchange's offerings.
OKX's overhaul introduces two essential changes:  
Perpetual Futures, replacing the former Perpetual Swap Contracts, and Expiry  
Futures, formerly known as Future Contracts. 
According to the company, while these updates  
rebrand existing instruments, OKX has assured traders of continued access to  
familiar functionalities and trading pairs. Notably, OKX has revamped its interface within the  
futures trading section. The design aims to simplify navigation, providing  
traders with a more intuitive and accessible trading platform.
Transition and Market Adjustment Plans
Traders can transition to OKX Futures by accessing  
the Futures Trading option through the web and app (version 6.46.0) starting  
December 15, the company noted. While the trading process remains consistent, the updated naming  
convention aims to provide a more streamlined experience for users.
To maintain stability, OKX plans to ensure that there is no alteration to  
API parameters, which is crucial for automated trading systems. This  
decision aims to facilitate uninterrupted,  
efficient trading experiences for users relying on automation.
In a parallel initiative, OKX has scheduled an  
adjustment to position tiers of perpetual swaps and futures on December 18,  
aiming to fortify market liquidity and mitigate risks.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves...

Bitcoin Spot ETF Denial To Impact The Crypto Space
 
Nate Geraci took to his official X (formerly Twitter) handle to share his optimism on the impact of a Bitcoin Spot ETF if rejected. The analyst’s recent prediction came amidst the recent bearish sentiment encompassing the crypto asset and market.
 
According to him, if the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denies a Bitcoin Spot ETF, it could lead to a major rug pull in cryptocurrency. He asserted that if an ETF is not approved in January, the rug pull will be one of the “bigger rug pulls” in crypto history.

Worldcoin representatives are said to be “working directly with regulators to meet Kenya’s requirements.”
 
Worldcoin to Restart Kenyan Iris Scanning in Early 2024
 
According to a report, Worldcoin representatives may have reached an agreement with Kenyan authorities which allows the iris biometric cryptocurrency project to resume operations under new guidelines. The report, which cites unnamed sources, said this is likely to happen sometime in early 2024.
 
The claim that Worldcoin is set to resume distributing its WLD tokens to users who agree to have their eyeballs scanned comes just a few months after Kenyan authorities suspended such activities. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, Kenyan regulators were adamant that Worldcoin did not have the necessary license to carry out its activities in the East African country.
 
 
Following the suspension, Worldcoin representatives visited Kenya where they made an appearance before the country’s legislative body. However, according to a Citizen Digital report, Worldcoin may have satisfied concerns initially raised by regulators.
 
“Worldcoin is working directly with regulators to meet Kenya’s requirements, particularly as the Assembly considers new regulations. Stipends will remain and will expand to locations across the country,” the unnamed source reportedly said.
 
The report, however, did not reveal when the Kenyan parliament is expected to pass new data regulations which will guide entities like Worldcoin.
