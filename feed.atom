Shiba Inu Supply On Exchanges Has Plunged Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, the Shiba Inu supply on exchanges has seen a sharp drop recently. The “supply on exchanges” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating Shiba Inu supply that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric goes down, it means that the investors are transferring a net number of coins from these platforms toward their self-custodial wallets right now.
 
 
Generally, the main reason why holders would shift their coins in this way is to hold onto them for extended periods. Naturally, thi…]]></summary>

This sentiment, expressed in a two-part interview with Finance Magnates, comes in the wake of the SEC's aggressive legal actions against key players like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, despite their notable loss against Ripple. 
Gabbay's remarks reflect the growing tension between the regulatory body and the crypto industry. He added, "What's amazing is that even though they're paying for it, they go ahead and file a complaint against Kraken, which basically shows tha…]]></summary>

Under the new guidelines, which are the first of their kind in the United States, businesses will need to disclose the value of cryptocurrencies based on their market prices at the end of each reporting period. This move aims to provide greater transparency and accuracy in financial reporting, acknowledging the volatile nature of digital assets like Bitcoin.

He suggested that the outcome of the case was already obvious even before the trial began. Mills also gave an insight into why he took on the case despite his reservations. 
 
Sam Bankman-Fried Fraud Case Was “Unwinnable”
 
In an interview with Bloomberg, Mills said that pre-trial rulings by the judge and powerful testimony of the prosecution witnesses made the case “unwinnable” for SBF. Judge Lewis Kaplan (the Judge who oversaw the case) had made several pretrial rulings ahead of the trial, with a majority of them going against Bankman-Fried.

Judaism is based on a construct of ethical codes of conduct that are taught at weekly gatherings. Each week on Saturday mornings, Jews come together to read a weekly portion of the Torah (Old testament) to learn about the tenets of living in harmony with Jewish ethics. One of these principles is the ban on taking interest on a loan. The ban is mentioned in the weekly Torah reading Ki Tzei.

This prohibition aimed to prevent such dire outcomes. The question arises: why…]]></summary>
