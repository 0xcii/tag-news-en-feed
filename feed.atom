        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week trading around the $30,000 mark, as the cryptocurrency market continued to consolidate following last week’s gains. The global market was down 1.19% at the time of writing, as sentiment remains uncertain following a weekend of profit taking. Ethereum was also down on Monday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) narrowly avoided a drop below the $30,000 level on Monday, as market sentiment remained uncertain following recent gains.
 
BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $30,045.23 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after peaking at $30,437.56.
 
Some expected prices to drop this week, after last week’s rally pushed volumes deep into overbought territory.

The relative strength index (RSI), which reached a high of 66.00 last week, now sits at the 52.85 mark.
 
This is marginally above a floor at 52.00, which seems to have been the last line of defense preventing BTC from falling under $30,000.
 
As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $30,201.14.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also moved lower on Monday, however traders were once again able to prevent price from dropping below the $1,900 level.
 
Following a high of $1,942.03 during Sunday’s session, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,901.06 to start the week.
 
This resulted in the world’s second largest cryptocurrency falling lower for a fourth consecutive day.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Since reaching a multi-month high at $2,029, sellers and profit takers have moved to push price lower.
 
Similar to BTC, this was due to price strength being overbought, with a reading above the 70.00 mark. However, it now sits at 52.94.
 
The next visible floor appears to be at 50.00, and should it reach this point, ethereum will likely be trading below $1,900.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The legal battle between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, has taken an unexpected turn of events. The transcript on July 13 reveals that Judge Katherine Polk Failla, who presides over the pre-motion conference, expressed sentiments that some community commentators now describe as aligning with Coinbase’s defense. 
 
Judge Aligns with Coinbase’s Argument
 
The information was shared on Twitter by a lawyer, MetaLawMan. And in his view, Judge Failla’s comments align with Coinbase on a crucial argument.
 
In a lawsuit filed in New York, the regulator alleges that Coinbase operates as a broker-dealer, clearinghouse, and exchange for unregistered crypto asset securities without regulatory oversight. However, the Judge referenced …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[National  
Australia Bank (NAB) has actively taken measures to safeguard its customers  
from financial scams, recently intervening in transactions worth over $270  
million. This move comes as a response to the rising scam concerns between  
March and July. Additionally, NAB is introducing restrictions on payments to specific  
cryptocurrency platforms, which have proven to be high-risk areas for scam  
activities.
However,  
what some see as caring for users' welfare and combating risky investments,  
others perceive as an impediment to the industry's development, trying to block  
it, especially since similar movements can be observed in other parts of the  
world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Fernando Nikolic, the director of marketing and communications for Blockstream.
“Bitcoin is not for everyone.” It's a bold statement that may seem counterintuitive when the goal is mass adoption. After all, shouldn't we aim to convince everyone about the benefits of Bitcoin? Well, the truth is, we can't. And that's okay.
In our world, it's easy to live within a filter bubble, surrounded by like-minded plebs who reinforce our beliefs. But when we attempt to market Bitcoin to the masses, we quickly realize that not everyone shares our enthusiasm. The resounding chorus of "no" can be disheartening, and there are many examples of people claiming to “give up” on orange-pilling normies. 
That's not the way forward. We just need to resist the temptation to use the …]]></summary>

Ripple’s favorable court ruling propelled altcoins like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) to double-digit gains.
 
Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, briefly reached a new yearly high at $31,840, although it was unable to sustain the bullish breakout. Despite encouraging US economic data, profit-taking prevailed during the last trading day of the week. As the market enters a new week, the focus shifts to the US Dollar Index (DXY) and its potential impact on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market.

Specifically, the blockchain analytics firm explained that crypto inflows to known illicit entities are down 65% compared to the previous year while inflows to risky entities are down 42%.
 
Crypto Crime Down ‘Significantly’ This Year
 
Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis released its mid-year update on cryptocurrency-related crime on Wednesday. Noting that crypto crime is down 65% overall, the firm wrote:
 

Our data shows that cryptocurrency-related crime is down significantly this year.
 
“Through the end of June, crypto inflows to known illicit entities — not including inflows to entities that have been sanctioned or subject to special measures — are down 65% compared to where they were at the same time in 2022,” Chainalysis detailed.
 
In addition, “Inflows to risky entities (made up primarily of mixers and high-risk exchanges) are down 42%” and “Inflows to illicit addresses are down in nearly every category,” the firm noted.
 
While crypto crime is down substantially overall, the blockchain analytics firm pointed out that ransomware was the sole type of cryptocurrency-related crime projected to grow in 2023, as attackers have extorted an additional $175.8 million more than they did during the same time period last year.
 
 
Moreover, crypto scammers have experienced a significant drop in revenue compared to the previous year, with their total collections in 2023 through June being approximately $3.3 billion less than in 2022. Noting that their total earnings for the current year amounted to slightly over $1 billion, Chainalysis emphasized:
 

Through the end of June, crypto scammers have pulled in 77% less revenue than they did through June of 2022 — and keep in mind as well that 2022 itself saw a large drop in revenue compared to 2021.
