        <updated>2023-10-26T12:43:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a brief spell above $35,000 late on Wednesday, bitcoin retreated below this level during today’s session. Despite the decline, the cryptocurrency continues to trade close to an 18-month high on Thursday. Ethereum rose back above the $1,800 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin once again fell below the $35,000 level on Thursday, after a brief stint above this level on Wednesday.
 
Following a high of $35,133.76 late in yesterday’s session, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $34,151.88 earlier today.
 
The move saw bitcoin continue to trade close to its strongest point since May 2022, when price was over $37,000.
 
 
At the time of writing, bitcoin is now trading at $33,990.55, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to penetrate the 90.00 zone.
 
Currently, the index is at a reading of 82.99, which remains significantly overbought in the medium term.
 
Should sentiment begin to truly shift bearish, a floor at $31,000 is the likely target for bears in the market.
 
 
Ethereum
 
On the other hand, ethereum (ETH) was mostly higher, leading prices back above the $1,800 level.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,865.10 earlier in today’s session, following a low at $1,781.49 on Wednesday.
 
As a result of today’s surge, ethereum rose to its highest level since August, when the price hovered below $1,880.
 
 
The cryptocurrency has now traded in the green for seven straight sessions, adding nearly 20% to its value during this period.
 
Overall, the 10-day (red) moving average continued to race ahead of its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which is a sign that momentum remains bullish.
 
At the time of writing, the RSI is at 74.90, which could cause current buyers to soon begin to capture gains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Pengyu Wang, the founder of Particle Network, developer solutions known as zero-knowledge wallet-as-a-service (ZK-WaaS) embody Web3 principles and “are highly performant” which in turn makes them “an evergreen solution that will become the industry standard.” Wang also points to how zero-knowledge technology helps ensure a core principle of Web3, asset sovereignty for end users, is upheld.
 
‘Complexities Associated With Traditional Web3 Wallets’
 
In written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, Wang also pointed to how WaaS can turn out to be a developer solution that ultimately brings the masses to Web3. According to the Particle Network founder, this is due to the fact that WaaS wallets are not burdened with the “complexities [often] associated with traditional Web3 wallets.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto market is currently experiencing a significant upswing, with cryptocurrencies collectively gaining $1.3 trillion in market capitalization over the past week. This surge in enthusiasm for digital assets coincides with the imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States, providing a major boost to the entire crypto ecosystem.
 
As a striking counterpoint, the tech stock market has been grappling with a substantial decline. Nearly $200 billion was wiped from the market capitalization of the so-called “magnificent seven” tech stocks, a group that includes heavyweights such as Meta, Apple, and Alphabet. These tech giants collectively contribute a quarter of the value of the S&P 500 index.

The most notable ones seem to have come from the testimonies of his ‘inner circle.’
 
How Sam Bankman-Fried Saw Himself
 
As part of its case, the prosecution got Alameda Reserach’s ex-CEO Caroline Ellison, FTX’s co-founder Gary Wang, and FTX’s former Director of Engineering Nishad Singh to testify against their former associate Bankman-Fried. Many will argue that these witnesses lived up to the hype as key witnesses as they helped corroborate the prosecution’s allegations.
