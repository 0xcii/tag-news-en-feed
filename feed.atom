In the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances.
 
Ben Lilly: “(…) for fundamentals… Nothing has changed. If anything, builders are building faster than ever before. All of us veterans know that right now are the most productive weeks you can have in crypto. It is a blessing to those that can weather such bearish times.”

However, recent forecasts from the economist could actually be in favor of bitcoin if they do come to pass. Just before the end of the year 2022, Schiff shared his thoughts about inflation, the US dollar, and where he believes both of these are headed.
 
Inflation Will Surge, Dollar Will Suffer
 
In tweets that were shared by the economist, he talks about the current inflation trend. According to Schiff, the current belief that inflation would slow down in the new year are wrong. Rather, he expects higher inflation numbers in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The LUNC burn has now been in full swing for a couple of months now. In a bid to reduce the large supply of the token, investors had taken to sending coins to dead (burn) addresses. There had been a slowdown though toward the end of 2022 as the holidays came with low momentum but the first day of the new year has seen this quickly change. Already, the burn rate is up more than 6,000% as investors re-commit to the cause.
 
LUNC Burn Jumps 6,940%
 
The LUNC Burn Tracker account on Twitter has shown a significant bump in the amount of LUNC tokens being burned. Leading up to the end of 2022, LUNC burn figures had dropped drastically to 3 figures and below. 
 
 
For example, on Friday, Dec. 30, only 295,979 LUNC tokens were burned worth only $43. The last day of the year would be no different a…]]></summary>

However, much of that perception may have been a facade as a recent report details that Alameda suffered from financial troubles as early as 2018.

In an interview, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund said the global economy will face a challenging year in 2023.
 
In doing so, Georgieva described China‘s slowing growth as the biggest threat this year, with the world economy’s other main growth engines – the U.S. and Europe – also set to experience a slowdown.
 
“For the first time in 40 years, China’s growth in 2022 is likely to be at or below global growth,” Georgieva said. A slowdown is already evident in the EU, triggered by the war between Ukraine and Russia, she said.

This is an opinion editorial by Stephan Livera, host of the “Stephan Livera Podcast” and managing director of Swan Bitcoin International.
As the 2022 chapter closes, it’s time to turn our eyes to what’s coming in 2023. Here are some themes I’m seeing for Bitcoin in 2023.
Regulatory Overreach
The Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule is forcing exchanges and bitcoin service providers to document and share ever-more information about customer transactions. We are seeing politicians such as Elizabeth Warren publicly go against Bitcoin, and even if her proposed digital asset AML act has no real chance of passing, it does foreshadow that there are…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio 72-Hour MA Has Been Going Down Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the bitcoin exchange ratio on a 72-hour moving average has been on a decline. The “exchange whale ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 Bitcoin transactions to exchanges and the total exchange inflow.
 
Since the ten largest deposits to exchanges are usually from the whales, this metric tells us what part of the total exchange inflows is being contributed by these humongous holders. Thus, when the value of the indicator is high, it means whales are making up a high part of the inflow…]]></summary>

In addition to a ruling in favor of Ripple, the community is also hoping for a settlement that could impose a penalty on Ripple but classify all present XRP sales as non-security.
 
Attorney John E. Deaton, who is representing 75,000 XRP investors in the lawsuit with an amicus brief, recently put up a poll on Twitter about what outcome the community expects in 2023. Out of 18,000 votes, 59% of people said they expected a settlement between Ripple and the SEC.
