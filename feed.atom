This is an opinion editorial by Jaime García, a Salvadoran-Canadian Bitcoiner and co-host of Global Bitcoin Fest.
The hype around Bitcoin NFTs, made possible through inscriptions that use the Ordinal protocol, is undeniable. Trader and art dealer Steven Hay has even suggested that the government of El Salvador release an official Ordinal art collection to potentially raise money to fund its proposed Bitcoin City or otherwise accelerate Bitcoin adoption.
Unfortunately, this suggestion seems to lack an on-the-ground Salvadoran perspective and, in my view, is a blatant attack on El Salvador’s Bitcoin objectives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week trading in the red, as markets prepared for an important week of U.S. economic events. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is expected to increase rates by 25 basis points, with nonfarm payrolls for April being released this coming Friday. Ethereum was also lower in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade lower on Monday, as markets remained in consolidation ahead of a pivotal week of economic events.
 
Following a high of $29,952.03 on Sunday, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $28,360.50 earlier today.
 
This move saw bitcoin briefly fall below a key support point at $28,500, hitting its lowest point since April 27 in the process.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, bitcoin remains nearly 4% higher than at the same point last week, when prices were close to the $27,000 mark.
 
As a result of today’s sell-off, the relative strength index (RSI) has dropped to a floor of its own at 50.00.
 
The index is now tracking at 50.09, with BTC rebounding from its earlier low, and currently trading at $28,591.66.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also in the red, as prices plunged for a second consecutive session.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,829.41 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after trading at a peak of $1,938.42.
 
Similar to BTC, today’s slippage sent ethereum below its own point of support at the $1,830 level.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
ETH has since rebounded from this floor, as bulls opted to buy the dip, rather than continuing to flee positions.
 
This was helped by the fact that the RSI here also collided with a support zone at 45.00, and it continues to track beyond this point.
 
Bulls will likely be targeting reentry above $1,900 in upcoming days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's no doubt that the SEC dealt Kraken—and the outlook for crypto staking products in the U.S.—a big blow when it announced a $30 million settlement and ordered the company to stop offering the service to its customers in the states in February. Now Marco Santori, the company's chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
