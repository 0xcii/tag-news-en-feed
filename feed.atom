The decision to delay the listing of the coin was prompted by what the team terms “current market conditions.”
 
Scheduled Token Unlocking Postponed
 
Nearly eight months after becoming the first country in Africa to adopt bitcoin, the Central African Republic (CAR) recently said it will not proceed with the listing of its “Sango” crypto token as planned. In a statement reportedly posted in a sango coin Telegram group, the team promoting the token claimed that “current market conditions” had necessitated this decision.

Meanwhile, frustration with the SEC and lawmakers is growing in the U.S. crypto industry.
 
Despite the fact that various industry leaders have called for clear laws and guidance for regulated progress, the agency led by Gary Gensler refuses to act. Instead, Gensler has repeatedly emphasized recently that the present regulatory framework is sufficient, and that the SEC will continue to rely on its regulatory approach through enforcement.

Sam Bankman-Fried is under house arrest. As many would already know, this was made possible by a $250 million bail his mom and dad put up just so they could prevent him from staying in another prison cell, and attend to him, like fixing him breakfast, maybe do his laundry, things parents do to their beloved child.
 
Now that he’s home, that doesn’t mean people can just drop by anytime for coffee or chat. The road leading up to his parents house has been closed down from the public.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trading desk QCP Capital recently published its 2023 crypto forecast on their latest edition of “Just Crypto.” The firm highlighted this past year’s key moments, their potential impact going into a new year, and possible future digital assets and the global market. 
 
 
The report points out 2022’s year-to-date return for global assets. The market has experienced its worst-performing year for benchmark assets, such as Bitcoin, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and others.
 
Except for Natural Gas, other assets saw their worst losses since the 1970s. Bitcoin (BTC) alone crashed over 70% from its all-time high, while Ethereum (ETH) saw a 72% loss. This negative performance “was a by-product of the sharpest rate hike cycle in recent history” by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).
