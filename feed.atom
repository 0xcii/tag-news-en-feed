Dunn, known online as StaccOverflow, is accused of draining nearly $2 million from the Solana-based memecoin marketplace on May 16th. However, in a surprising twist, Dunn isn’t pleading innocence.
 
Instead, he’s claiming the real crime lies with Pump Fun itself.
 
 
Pump Fun: Alleged Heist Or Robin Hood Act?
 
Pump Fun aimed to capitalize on the memecoin craze sweeping the crypto world. However, the platform remained obscure until Dunn’s alleged hack thrust it into the spotlight.
 
While details remain scarce, Dunn, posting from a different online account while in custody, claims he plans to challenge the prosecution (“argue with the crown” in his words) by portraying Pump Fun as the true…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genesis Global, a bankrupt crypto lender, has received court approval to distribute $3 billion in cash and cryptocurrencies to its creditors. However, the decision excludes its parent Digital Currency Group (DCG) from receiving any recovery from the bankruptcy.
The court’s ruling on Friday cleared the company to unfreeze and return customers’ assets that were locked up since November 2022. The lender also shuttered all trading operations last year. 
Another Failed Crypto Lender
Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York in January 2023 following the troubles it faced from its exposure to Three Arrows Capital, a collapsed crypto hedge fund, and FTX, which is also under bankruptcy process.
