The token’s price has been consistently down only, losing the vast majority of its early July gains. However, a recent development on Tuesday could suggest that there is a reversal coming for the meme coin.
 
PEPE’s Daily Trading Volume Rises By 47%
 
At a time when the majority of coins in the crypto market are recording a decline in trading activities, PEPE has seen its trading activity rise. According to data from Coinmarketcap, PEPE’s daily trading volume is up over 40% in the last 24 hours. This significant jump has seen the meme coin’s daily trading volume go from $60 million on Monday to more than $90 million on Tuesday.

Despite the double appearance of the deadly sounding technical trigger, it might not spell certain doom for ETHUSD, as we’ll explain.
 
What To Expect From The Ethereum Double Death Cross
 
All eyes are now on Ethereum as another 1W death cross has appeared. The signal comes just weeks after a weekly golden cross, which immediately followed the first ever death cross in ETHUSD.
 
A death cross usually tells long-term trend traders that the trend will soon be pointed downward, and generates a sell signal in a moving average (MA) crossover trading system.
