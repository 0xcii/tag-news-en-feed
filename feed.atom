Storm Appeals To The Web3 Community For Financial Help
 
Taking to X on January 22, Storm said 2024 would be definitive and that he is “scared.” However, the developer hopes the community cares “with a passion” and will donate to support the legal team defending against the US government’s allegations. 
 
All donations will be channeled through JusticeDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) leading legal matters relating to Tornado Cash. 
 
 
The call for assistance comes after Storm’s arrest by US authorities in 2023. This arrest occurred despite the developer’s wil…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Supply In Loss Is Nearing In On Historical Rebound Level
 
As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained, the BTC price and Supply in Loss have followed a certain pattern a few times. The “Supply in Loss” here is an indicator measuring the percentage of the Bitcoin supply currently being held at some loss.
 
 
This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. If this last transfer price for any coin was less than the current spot price of the asset, then that particular coin is sitting on some unrealized loss right now.

revealed that the unauthorized post about approving spot  
Bitcoin ETFs on January 9 was related to a "SIM swap" attack. 
This tactic involves transferring a mobile phone  
number to a different device without the owner's consent. The US securities  
watchdog clarified that the attack occurred via a telecommunication network  
rather than through its internal systems. It emphasized that its core systems  
were never compromised.
The misleading post, which declared the green light  
for the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, caused a frenzy in the  
cryptocurrency sector. However, the SEC was quick to dismiss the post,  
attributing it to a hacker who had gained control of the mobile phone number  
linked to the account.

Iris Boosts Mining Capacity to 6 EH/s Amidst IREN Share Dip
 
​​The announcement on Tuesday from Iris Energy (Nasdaq: IREN) highlighted the growth of its mining operations to 6 EH/s, following the deployment of new mining hardware. Over the last six months, Iris has reported several purchases of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining rigs.
 
Notably, in October 2023, the company disclosed the acquisition of Bitmain S21 Antminers worth $19.6 million. This was followed in November by the purchase of 7,000 T21 Antminers from the ASIC manufacturer.
 
Additionally, in December, Iris announced the acquisition of another 8,380 T21 Antminers from Bitmain. Iris Energy is projecting an increase in its mining operations, expecting an additional 4 exahash per second (EH/s) to become operational by the end of the first half of 2024.
 
 
The company also emphasized its trajectory towards achieving a 20 EH/s target by the latter half of 2024. This ambitious goal comes on the heels of a significant acquisition – a purchase and fixed price option agreement for an extra 10 EH/s of Bitmain T21 miners.
 
 
Shares of IREN have not performed as strongly as they did in 2023, experiencing a notable decline of 47.2% against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year. A recent analysis by theminermag.com reveals that publicly-listed mining companies have seen a reduction in value, amounting to $6 billion, since the year’s commencement.
