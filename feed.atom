        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Dea Rezkitha, an Indonesian Bitcoin educator and podcast host.
In politics, individuals are often grouped into “left” and “right” wings, but the complexities go well beyond this simple dichotomy. To gain a deeper understanding of people’s beliefs and values, and ultimately how these will inform their outlook on Bitcoin, it is crucial to consider their social views as well. This is where a political compass comes into play, serving as a valuable tool for analysis.
What Is A Political Compass?
The political compass is a graphical representation of political ideologies that helps categorize individuals or groups based on their views on two main axes: economic policy (left-right) and social policy (authoritarian-libertarian). It provides a more nuanced understan…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin plunged from a recent fourteen-month high to start the weekend, as traders appeared to have begun securing yesterday’s gains. The decline saw the price fall below $30,000, days after almost moving above $32,000. Ethereum also slipped, however remained above $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $30,000 to start the weekend, as traders began to take profits, following recent highs.
 
After peaking at $31,354.48 on Saturday, BTC/USD plunged to an intraday low of $29,966.39 earlier today.
 
This sees bitcoin retreat from a high of $31,862, which was the strongest level for the cryptocurrency since last May.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the decline was somewhat inevitable, due to the relative strength (RSI) moving into overbought territory.
 
The index rose to a peak of 65.55 on Thursday, before falling to a current reading of 54.17 earlier today.
 
Since this drop, price strength has since stabilized, with BTC now trading at $30,347.59.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also moved lower on Saturday, however traders were able to reject a drop below the $1,900 level.
 
ETH/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,901.36 earlier in the day, less than 24-hours after trading at a top of $2,005.96.
 
Since hitting Friday’s three-month high, bulls have opted to abandon previous positions heading into the weekend.
 
 
The world’s second largest cryptocurrency has since rebounded, bouncing away from a floor at $1,900, and now trades at $1,943.27.
 
This comes as the RSI held firm at a support point around the 55.00 zone, going on to climb to a current reading of 56.79.
 
Overall, the next target could be around the 61.00 mark, and if successfully hit, ETH will likely be back over $2,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin has become an integral part of New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ financial strategy, as he boldly embraced the cryptocurrency and positioned the city as a thriving hub for the industry.
 
However, an unfortunate oversight occurred when Adams mistakenly failed to disclose a certain aspect of his involvement with Bitcoin, a misstep that stemmed from his belief that it did not qualify as a security, according to his team.
 
 
Renowned for his outspoken support of Bitcoin, Adams, who previously served as a police officer, wholeheartedly advocates for the widespread adoption of the cryptocurrency. 
 
In a bold move, he even opted to receive a portion of his salaries in Bitcoin, favoring the decentralized digital currency over traditional fiat currencies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcache, a crypto startup backed by Kim Dotcom, has been liquidated, reportedly over unpaid legal fees. Phil Creagh, an Auckland lawyer who acted as Bitcache’s director until Sept. 2020, is reported to have applied for the startup’s liquidation on May 24. 
 
Bitcache’s Unpaid Legal Fees
 
A New Zealand-based crypto startup previously promoted by prominent crypto advocate and entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, has been reportedly liquidated over unpaid legal fees. According to a report by Newsroom, owners of the startup known as Bitcache have not contested the decision to liquidate.
 
The liquidation of the startup, which Kim Dotcom lauded as a platform that would revolutionize the way online content creators get paid, came more than six years after it was launched. Phil Creagh, an Auckland lawyer who acted as Bitcache’s director until Sept. 2020, is reported to have applied for the startup’s liquidation on May 24.
 
 

Commenting on the decision to liquidate Bitcache before it achieved any of its objectives, Creagh said:
 

It’s pretty straightforward, there are fees owed and not paid. The company has not taken any steps so far to avoid being placed in liquidation. We’ll put it in liquidation and see what, if anything, can be recovered.
 
The lawyer added that his firm Anderson Creagh Lai stopped representing the Kim Dotcom-backed startup some time ago.
 
According to the Newsroom report, Bitcache initially hit a major obstacle in early 2017 when the platform’s planned launch was interrupted by what Dotcom referred to as a “hiccup.” Since then, attempts to launch the platform have all failed. The report added that Bitcache, which reportedly last filed a return to the Companies Office in 2021, is now likely to be removed from the Companies Register.
