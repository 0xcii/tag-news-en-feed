Crypto Lawyer Doubts Possibility Of Ripple IPO In 2024
 
Earlier in November 2023, Wall Street expert, Linda Jones predicted that Ripple might launch its IPO in 2024. Referencing Jones’ forecast, an X (formerly Twitter) crypto enthusiast, posed the question of whether Ripple’s anticipated IPO would push the price of XRP to $10 in 2024.

        <updated>2024-01-16T20:34:04.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howard Lutnick, CEO of the renowned financial services company Cantor Fitzgerald, recently shared his insights on bitcoin and tether during an appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday. Lutnick drew parallels between the fervor around spot gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the anticipated trajectory of bitcoin.
 
Howard Lutnick Projects Bitcoin Rally Post-Halving, Validates Tether’s Reserve Strength
 
The Cantor Fitzgerald chief Howard Lutnick has observed that bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant surge and is now maintaining a stable performance. However, Lutnick anticipates a notable upswing in bitcoin’s value with the onset of the halving event.
 
“Bitcoin ran up and it’s gonna kind of stay steady. But when the halving comes, it’s going to start to rally again — so bitcoin I think will grow,” he asserted to Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum event in Davos.
 
 
Shifting the focus to tether (USDT), the foremost stablecoin in terms of market capitalization, currently valued at $94.8 billion and witnessing a 4.6% increase in supply over the past month, Lutnick offered insights into Cantor’s involvement with the stablecoin issuer.
 
He underscored that Cantor plays a significant role in managing numerous assets for Tether and expressed confidence in the company’s financial standing. Lutnick concluded:
 

From what we’ve seen, and we did a lot of work, they have the money.
 
 
Lutnick’s remarks stand in stark contrast to the skepticism surrounding Tether’s reserves, a topic that has been a point of contention among critics. Highlighting USDT’s substantial adoption, he pointed out its pronounced presence in particular economies, notably Turkey and several Latin American nations. Despite this widespread use, Lutnick acknowledged the limited necessity for fiat-linked tokens in the United States, conceding, “It’s not an American thing.”

The rise of AI, fueled by the popularity of tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard, has pushed crypto firms, which dominated past meetings, to the sidelines.
 
This year’s Davos Promenade, the main strip in the Swiss ski resort town, features prominent tech companies showcasing their AI products and services. Notably, several firms have joined forces to create “AI House,” a dedicated space for discussing and exploring the technology’s potential.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After obtaining a comprehensive capital markets license in Singapore, Hashkey Group announced it has successfully garnered $100 million through a Series A funding round. The fresh injection of capital is earmarked for expediting the growth of their licensed operations in Hong Kong, while simultaneously strengthening the company’s Web3 initiatives.
 
$100 Million Funding Aims to Fuel Expansion and Strengthen Web3 Initiatives
 
On Tuesday, Hashkey Group, based in Hong Kong, disclosed its successful fundraising of $100 million from a mix of strategic partners, institutional backers, and Web3 entities. This infusion of funds elevates the company to unicorn status, with an estimated valuation of approximately $1.2 billion.
 
In their Tuesday announcement sent to Bitcoin.com News, the company elaborated, “The newly raised capital will be used to solidify Hashkey’s Web3 ecosystem, accelerate the product diversification of its licensed business in Hong Kong, and drive the Group’s compliant and innovative development globally.”
 
 
The latest development comes on the heels of Hashkey securing a comprehensive Capital Markets Services (CMS) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Hashkey Exchange, the firm’s trading platform, boasts over 155,000 registered users and a trading volume of $630 million in the past month. On Tuesday, the group further highlighted its establishment of partnerships with six publicly traded companies and ten brokerage houses.
 
According to Crunchbase, Hashkey has executed 85 distinct investments, channeling funds into startups like Fetcch and Range Protocol. Notably, Hashkey recently spearheaded a $5 million pre-Series A funding round for 0xscope, with contributions also coming from GSR Markets, Redpoint China, Amber Group, and Okx Ventures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Market insights reveal that on Jan. 15, 2024, the stablecoin TUSD deviated from its usual $1 parity, dipping to $0.979 per coin the next day. By 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Tuesday, it managed to recover slightly, climbing above the $0.99 mark.
 
TUSD Faces Unsteady Ground, Drops Under $1
 
Recently, TUSD experienced fluctuations, slipping below its $1 benchmark on Monday. That evening, its value lingered around $0.98, amid challenges linked to the company’s real-time attestations. As of Jan. 16, 2024, TUSD’s circulating supply, as displayed on their website, stands at 1.92 billion tokens.
 

 
A significant portion of TUSD’s supply is in the hands of Binance, which owns the top five ERC20 wallets. Of the total supply, only 391.99 million TUSD tokens are issued on the Ethereum blockchain, while 1.48 billion are on the Tron network. Binance’s cold wallet holds approximately 1.4 billion of these tokens.
 
At 10:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, TUSD temporarily reached $0.996 per coin. Yet, by 10:20 a.m., it fell to about $0.987. This instability has sparked considerable debate on social media, with many questioning the reasons behind TUSD’s fluctuating peg. Most of the trading activity for the coin is concentrated on Binance, with a significant portion of its volume originating from this exchange.
 
 
In the last 24 hours, TUSD’s global trade volume hit $425 million. Despite a hefty supply of 1.92 billion TUSD, its market valuation on Tuesday was slightly lower, at $1.89 billion. TUSD is now among several stablecoins that have dealt with parity issues, a trend that began with the Terra blockchain ecosystem’s collapse in May 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fourth Bitcoin halving is almost upon us, and this one has the potential for some very interesting surprises. This halving marks the reduction of the Bitcoin supply subsidy from 6.25 BTC every block to 3.125 BTC per block. These supply reductions occur every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, as part of Bitcoin’s gradual, disinflationary approach to its final capped supply in circulation. 
The finite supply of 21 million coins is a, if not the, foundational characteristic of Bitcoin. This predictability of supply and inflation rate has been at the heart of what has driven demand and belief in bitcoin as a superior form of money. The regular supply halving is the mechanism by which that finite supply is ultimately enacted.
