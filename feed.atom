        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With its latest filing update, asset management firm ARK Investment Management has gained an edge in the race for the first Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.
 
The firm has amended its 19b-4 application filing for spot Bitcoin ETF to include a surveillance sharing agreement with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and a crypto exchange, likely Coinbase, according to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. 
 
The new agreement puts ARK’s filing similar to BlackRock’s recent filing. It is more likely to be approved since they filed first in collaboration with the institutional investment firm 21Shares.
 
Who Will Win The Bitcoin ETF Race?
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has previously cited concerns about the lack of surveillance and regulator…]]></summary>

In a blockchain network where participants remain anonymous, a dependable coordination mechanism is essential. The "proof" acts as confirmation that a participant has met the requirements to validate a block of transactions, signifying their good-faith participation. One such consensus algorithm employed to generate new blocks, distribute new cryptocurrency, and validate transactions is proof of stake (PoS).
This mechanism provides an alternative to the original consensus method, proof of work (PoW). Rather than the energy expenditure necessitated by PoW, PoS requires validators or miners to make contributions to the network from their own holdings of the blockchain's native cryptocurrency, i.e., their “stake.”
To avoid losing their stake, validators are incentivized to operat…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-28T17:25:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MicroStrategy, the leading public corporation in terms of bitcoin holdings, has once again demonstrated its aggressive bitcoin acquisition strategy. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 12,333 BTC for approximately $347.0 million, at an average price of $28,136 per bitcoin. This brings MicroStrategy's total holdings to an impressive 152,333 BTC, acquired at an average price of $29,668 per bitcoin. With a total of 21 million bitcoins set to ever exist, MicroStrategy now controls approximately 0.726% of the total available supply.
This latest move by MicroStrategy further solidifies its position as the largest public corporation holder of bitcoin. MicroStrategy's journey with bitcoin began in August 2020, and despite selling some of its holdings for tax loss harvesting in December 2022, the company has consistently increased its bitcoin collection. In fact, shortly after the sale, MicroStrategy acquired an additional 2,500 bitcoin, further bolstering its already significant holdings. With their current holdings, MicroStrategy now controls approximately 0.726% of the total 21 million bitcoins that will ever be mined.
In addition to its relentless accumulation of bitcoin, MicroStrategy has recently revealed plans to leverage Lightning for enterprise infrastructure services and content monetization solutions. The company's chairman, Michael Saylor, has been actively spearheading the mission of advancing Bitcoin adoption and development.
The latest acquisition of bitcoin by MicroStrategy reinforces the company's belief in the long-term viability of the digital asset. With Marathon being the only other company holding a substantial amount of bitcoin compared to MicroStrategy, and this acquisition being larger than their entire holdings, it is clear that MicroStrategy's aggressive acquisition strategy positions it as a dominant force in the corporate bitcoin space, controlling a significant percentage of the limited supply.]]></summary>
