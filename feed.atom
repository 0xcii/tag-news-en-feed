        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes, former CEO of Bitmex and cryptocurrency market analyst, pondered about the success of an upcoming spot bitcoin ETF and its effect on the future of bitcoin. Hayes states that the popularity of these ETF derivatives might concentrate the custody of all the bitcoin in a few hands that won’t move it, forcing miners to capitulate due to a lack of activity in the blockchain.
Arthur Hayes Believes ETFs Might Cause the Demise of Bitcoin
Former Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes believes that the success of an upcoming spot bitcoin ETF might endanger the existence of the Bitcoin network. In his most recent blog post, “Expression,” Hayes presents a hypothetical situation in which bitcoin is all in the hands of a few financial firms, like Blackrock.
If this happens, Hayes anticipates this will destroy bitcoin as a store of value, given that it is different from all of the assets traded in financial markets until now.
Hayes argued:
Bitcoin is the first monetary asset in human history that exists only if it moves. But if there was never another Bitcoin transaction between two entities, miners would be unable to afford the energy it costs to secure the network.
The result of this would be the shutdown of the whole Bitcoin network due to the starvation of miners who will receive fees only from bitcoin transactions after the subsidy ends circa 2140.
Hayes adds that this could happen if users come to value bitcoin as a financial asset more than a store of value, favoring the purchase of derivatives instead of the cryptocurrency. However, if bitcoin suffers this fate, Hayes anticipates the birth of a similar asset to allow people to transact in a non-state-owned financial system.
“Hopefully, the second time around, we will learn not to hand our private keys to the baldies,” he concluded.

This ancient kingdom, rich in history and once the mightiest empire in the world, is a forgotten desert in the eyes of much of the West. Yet those who choose to ignore the Persian empire seem to have forgotten their role in shaping its modern history. Much like the women of Iran removing their hijabs today, let us remove the veil of ignorance that has clouded this murky history and explore a chapter of its history that set the course for the world we know today.

However, the reform law does not reveal the amount of bitcoins that foreigners must donate to become eligible for expedited citizenship.
 
El Salvador’s Successful Bitcoin Bet
 

 
According to reports, El Salvador’s legislature recently passed an immigration law that promises an expedited path to citizenship for foreigners who donate bitcoin (BTC) to the country’s social and economic development programs. The law, which was approved on Dec. 20, has the backing of President Nayib Bukele’s New Ideas party.
 

 
Following bitcoin’s recent surge, which has seen the top crypto asset breach the $44,000 market, Bukele and his party have been touting El Salvador’s successful bitcoin bet. For instance, on Dec. 4, Bitcoin.com News reported that the value of the country’s bitcoin holdings was exceeding the initial outlay by more than $3 million. Another report revealed that El Salvador is now on course to launch in Q1 of 2024.
 

 

 

 
The approved reform law is set to come into force in the coming days, according to a Reuters report. The reform law states that “altruistic foreigners interested in supporting the economic, social and cultural development of El Salvador…by donating bitcoin” will be eligible for expedited citizenship. However, the reform law does not reveal the amount of bitcoins that foreigners must donate to become eligible for expedited citizenship.
 

 
It states that those who meet the donation threshold will be exempted from the five-year naturalization process of permanent residence that normally applies to applicants from non-Spanish-speaking countries. On September 7, 2021, El Salvador became the first nation globally to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.
