        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The developer with the most changes to Bitcoin’s code has announced his decision to step down from the Core maintainer role.
Bitcoin Core maintainer Marco Falke has announced he will step down from the role.
 
         
         
         
        The tweet posted by Falke. 
    
The prolific Bitcoin developer took to Twitter on Tuesday, saying that, “In a challenging decision, I concluded to transition out of my role as maintainer. I remain passionate about open source and Bitcoin and I am positive about the future, however being a maintainer is no longer a good fit for me personally.”
Falke also took the time to thank his sponsors. His latest funding support came from a joint grant by Okcoin and Paradigm. 
Falke was an incredibly active participant in the Bitcoin development process, notably having merged more changes into the Bitcoin Core code than any other person. Bitcoin Magazine previously covered the daily work of Falke as a Bitcoin Core repository maintainer, including his rise to become the most prolific Core Developer in terms of the sheer number of individual changes submitted to the project. 
Falke's contributions around testing infrastructure have been the most substantive, which he identified early on as an inefficiency in the project that he was passionate about improving, as testing is critical for ensuring continuity across the network and improving quality assurance.
With Falke’s departure, there will now be only four official Bitcoin Core maintainers. While these roles are incredibly important, it is also important to note that they do not officially control Bitcoin — Bitcoin users running full nodes must opt-in to the code changes that Bitcoin Core maintainers approve, adding a layer of checks and balances to the protocol.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash jumped to a fresh seven-month high on Tuesday, as prices rallied, despite bearish sentiment increasing. Today’s move comes as the global cryptocurrency market cap is trading 1.50% lower at the time of writing. One of the most notable tokens to fall has been polygon, which dropped for a fourth straight day.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) surged to a fresh multi-month high on Tuesday, despite sentiment in crypto markets turning bearish.
 
Following a low of $143.19 to start the week, BCH/USD moved to an intraday high of $152.71 in today’s session.
 
As a result of this surge, bitcoin cash moved to its highest point since July 31, which is the last time price was above $150.00.
 
 
Overall, BCH is up nearly 20% in the last seven days, with today’s gains following a breakout on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Price strength moved beyond a ceiling at 68.00, and at the time of writing, is tracking at 69.88.
 
Despite the next visible ceiling being at 71.00, earlier gains have begun to ease, with bulls opting to secure profits.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was one of last week’s big movers, however it has now fallen for a fourth straight session.
 
MATIC/USD dropped to a bottom at $1.41 on Tuesday, less than a day after price was trading at $1.50.
 
On Saturday, polygon bulls pushed prices deep into overbought territory by leading the token to its strongest point since last April.
 
 
As a result of this over-buying, bears saw this as an opportunity to reenter the market, sending the RSI from a high of 75.10, to a current reading of 62.70.
 
The index is now hovering marginally above a floor at 62.00, and should this be broken, bears could attempt to extend recent declines.
