Trump expressed a deep appreciation for the role of miners in stabilizing the national energy grid and underscored his readiness to support their efforts from the White House.
 
Following the meeting, the Trump campaign posted via Truth Social, “VOTE FOR TRUMP! Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC. Biden’s hatred of Bitcoin only helps China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left. We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!! It will help us be ENERGY DOMINANT!!!”

Bitcoin ‘Velocity’ Has Plunged To Historical Lows Recently
 
As explained by CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju in a post on X, Bitcoin’s circulation has recently slowed down. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is “Velocity,” which keeps track of the rate at which the cryptocurrency’s tokens are circulating in the market.
 
 
When the value of this metric is high, the coins move around faster on the network. On the other hand, a low value implies tokens are still inside an address long before being transferred.
 
Below is a chart that shows how the Velocity of Bitcoin has changed throughout its history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) futures are experiencing a surge in net short interest among leveraged funds, although this should not be mistaken for a bearish sentiment among hedge funds. Instead, experts suggest that the increase in short interest is primarily driven by the growing popularity of a market-neutral strategy known as the basis trade.
 
Spot Bitcoin ETFs Fuel Adoption Of Basis Trade Strategy?
 
The basis trade strategy aims to capitalize on discrepancies between spot and futures markets, and it is believed to account for a significant portion of the short interest observed in nearly 18,000 Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures contracts, according to Bloomberg.
