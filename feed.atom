        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When asked whether he’d rather be called a “bitcoin evangelist,” or “Bitcoin Jesus” at the recent Webx seminar in Tokyo, Roger Ver responds: “I prefer to be called Roger.” The enthusiastic and outspoken figure in crypto, scattering sats around the world with unapologetic frankness about government, the bitcoin block size wars, and conflations of legality with morality, Roger Ver has been somewhat quiet in recent months. That notwithstanding, the early bitcoin investor had much to say about the state of crypto in Tokyo this week, talking payments, altcoins, FTX, and the role of literal outlaws in changing the world for the better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Web3 wallets have become a crucial tool in  
the new era of the Internet, where decentralization, blockchain, and  
cryptocurrencies are at the forefront of innovation. A Web3 wallet, also known  
as a crypto wallet, is a digital wallet that enables users to store, send, and  
receive cryptocurrencies, interact with smart contracts, transact NFTs, and  
access dApps on different blockchains. 
As the use cases of Web3 wallets  
continue to expand, the question of whether centralization can play a role in  
managing these wallets arises. I will explore the concept of Web3 wallets  
managed by Centralized Exchange (CEX) and discuss whether it aligns with the  
principles of Web3.

Bolivian Central Bank Settling International Transactions Using the Chinese Yuan
 
The Bolivian Central Bank is carrying out settlements using the Chinese yuan in some of its international transactions. In a recent press conference, Economy Minister Marcelo Montenegro stated that the bank was already transacting using yuan, even without having Chinese banks in Bolivia.

The proposed bill, known as the “Clarity for Payments Stablecoin” bill, has been the subject of intense debate and scrutiny.
 
After an arduous 13-hour markup, the bill was advanced, making it the second major piece of crypto legislation to pass the Committee this week.
