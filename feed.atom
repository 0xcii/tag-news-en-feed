Even before the war, the Palestinian taxi driver couldn’t stand being a passive observer of unemployment and hunger, both prevalent in Gaza’s everyday life. In 2022 and early 2023, more than two million Gazans lacked access to clean water and an appropriate sewage system, while two-thirds of the population lived in poverty.
Against this backdrop, Yusef turned online for help. It was Ramadan of 2023 and he wondered if other Muslims across the globe would contribute with bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, that he could use to buy and distribute food for those in need and toys for children in Gaza. UK-based Bitcoiner Fumble was amongst those who answered his call.
