The legal battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is the major culprit behind this poor performance, has yet to end. However, this has not deterred the bullish sentiment among investors, who still believe that the altcoin’s price is destined for double digits.
 
Market Expert Says Selling XRP At $10 Is A Bad Idea

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former US President Donald Trump has found himself at the epicenter of a cryptocurrency-fueled windfall.
 
Data from market intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence reveals that Trump’s cryptocurrency portfolio has surged by a staggering 4,000% – a gain largely driven by the meteoric rise of the “Save America” meme coin, affectionately dubbed “TRUMP.”
 
 
According to the report, Trump’s affiliated crypto wallet has been the recipient of multiple airdrops of the TRUMP token, the latest of which occurred just 30 minutes prior to the analysis.
 
These generous airdrops have propelled the wallet’s value from a modest $7.4 million to a staggering $9 million in a single day, with the TRUMP meme coin alone accounting for a remarkable $1.30 million of that increase.

Bitcoin has for most of its lifetime been seen as a monetary network, whereby users can send and receive the native token BTC. Given the tremendous price appreciation since its inception in 2009, the monetary good also became a store of value — a means through which someone could store their valuable work hours so as to not have them debased and instead experience an increase of purchasing power rather than a loss.
Not all users are alike, however. Despite the popularity of these monetary narratives, some outcasts have used Bitcoin for all kinds of purposes throughout time. Most notably, Julian Assange, a now-famous journalist and political prisoner, creator …]]></summary>
