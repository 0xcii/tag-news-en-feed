        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a high-profile case that has garnered considerable attention, Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced CEO of the now-bankrupt FTX crypto exchange, is seeking a lighter sentence, citing his autism spectrum disorder.
 
Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argue that his condition makes him “uniquely vulnerable” in a prison environment and should result in a reduced sentence of five to six years instead of the maximum 110-year term recommended by sentencing guidelines. 
 
Sam Bankman-Fried’s Lawyers Argue For Reduced Sentence
 
According to a Fortune Magazine report, in a sentencing memo filed by Bankman-Fried’s legal team, they contend that his autism spectrum disorder puts him at a “higher risk of violence” and extortion from other inmates due to his behavior.
