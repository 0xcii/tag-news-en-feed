The crypto market witnessed a remarkable surge in SHIB’s value as Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new milestone at $35,000, though it subsequently pulled back to the $34,000 level. 
 
This substantial upward momentum spurred investors to act swiftly and secure positions in anticipation of what promises to be an exciting bull run. However, as we enter November, the crucial question looming over the market is whether these gains can be sustained.
