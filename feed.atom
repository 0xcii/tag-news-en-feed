Max Keiser who is a staunch Bitcoin supporter shared a patent that is more than three decades old to put forward claims that XRP is centralized.
 
Keiser Says XRP Is Centralized
 
In the post that Max Keiser made on X, he attaches a picture of a patent filing which he used to buttress his point that XRP is centralized. The patent is dated June 18, 1991, which means that it was filed 32 years ago. However, Keiser believes that this patent filed by Ripple co-creator and Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz proves that the altcoin is centralized.

HTX exchange fell victim to a major hack on September 24, resulting in the loss  
of $7.9 million worth of digital assets. The breach was brought to light by  
blockchain analytics platform Cyvers, sending shockwaves through the crypto  
community.
However, what  
sets this incident apart is the exchange's claim to have unmasked the hacker's  
identity and a surprising offer of a "white-hat bonus" to the  
culprit, provided they return most of the stolen funds. A message, written in  
Chinese, emerged from a known Huobi hot wallet, addressed directly to the  
hacker.
HTX's  
Response
The message  
asserted that Huobi Global had successfully identified the attacker and had an  
unconventional proposition. The exchange offered to let the hacker retain 5% of  
the stolen fund…]]></summary>

I will never not enjoy that clip. “Clown world” has become so much more than just a meme. 
Here in the US, but relevant for Europe as well, we have had two tribes within the energy generation industry that have been at-odds for the better part of the past few decades; oil & gas, and renewables (wind and solar specifically). One side calling for the complete phasing-out of the other. While their opposition is pointing to hypocrisies, chiefly: the heavy reliance on demonized resources in order to develop their operations throughout the production, deployment, operation, and maintenance stack – effectively increasing the demand for that which was demonized in the first place.

While the rest of the digital asset sector has been struggling recently, Chainlink has stood out as a coin that has registered a rapid uptrend. The price has continued this recent run during the past day as well, as its price is now floating above the $7.2 level.
 

 
 
During the past week, every coin except LINK inside the top 20 assets by market cap has seen negative returns. LINK’s strong gains, thus, make it by far the best performer in the sector.

In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Stark stated that it feels unusual that the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) haven’t added Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents as defendants in their son’s case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that underscores MicroStrategy's unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, the software company has added 5,445 more BTC to its corporate treasury.
The latest acquisition, made on September 24, 2023, comes at an average price of approximately $27,053 per Bitcoin, amounting to an investment of $147.3 million.
This purchase brings MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings to a staggering 158,245 BTC, acquired at an average price of around $29,582 per Bitcoin, equivalent to approximately $4.68 billion. 
MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, has been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin, touting it as digital gold and emphasizing its role as a strategic treasury reserve asset. This latest acquisition further cements MicroStrategy's position as one of the most prominent institutional investors in Bitcoin.
The move comes as no surprise to those following MicroStrategy's journey in the world of cryptocurrencies. The company first ventured into Bitcoin investments in August 2020 when it made its initial purchase. Since then, it has continued to accumulate Bitcoin, even using debt to finance some of its acquisitions.
All the while, Saylor has continued to assert that Bitcoin is "underestimated" compared to other crypto market opportunities, as this video from Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo shows. Saylor has repeatedly said that altcoins are overvalued and should be sold.
With the growing recognition of Bitcoin's value as a store of value and a potential hedge against economic uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether more institutions will follow in MicroStrategy's footsteps.]]></summary>
