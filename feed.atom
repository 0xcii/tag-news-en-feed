        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While most of the crypto market seems to have stalled, meme coins such as Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have continued to put on an impressive performance. These cryptocurrencies have seen gains where others have struggled, rising rapidly over the past week. This suggests that the meme coin bulls are still in control at a time when bears are gaining ground.
 
PEPE And SHIB Record Double-Digit Gains
 
The past week has been favorable for meme coins, especially PEPE and SHIB, both of which have recorded double-digit gains during this time. For PEPE, the gains climbed over 23% given renewed interest in the meme coin. While SHIB rose 16% in the same time period.

Addressing the widespread issue of tainted change, also known as leftover unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) remaining from Whirlpool Coinjoins, this could represent a monumental advancement in the cryptocurrency landscape.
 
Tackling the Tainted Change Problem
 
Samourai Wallet has unveiled a new capability allowing bitcoin (BTC) to monero (XMR) atomic swaps, offering a more discreet means of transacting. Atomic swaps enable two parties to exchange different cryptocurrencies without requiring a trustworthy intermediary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin Frontier Fund is introducing a groundbreaking accelerator program dedicated to companies in the Ordinals ecosystem, per a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.
Each selected Ordinals venture will receive a $100,000 seed investment, signifying a strategic shift toward Bitcoin's technical enhancement.
The fund raised $6.95 million to support Bitcoin-focused companies — with a growing focus on Ordinals infrastructure firms such as Gamma, Xverse and lending platform Liquidium. 
"Ordinals is what we've been waiting for," lead investor Trevor Owens highlighted. "You always want to build as close to native Bitcoin as you can, and Casey [Rodarmor] has changed the game there."
The Ordinals protocol introduces a novel approach to numbering satoshis — the smallest units of bitcoin — allowing arbitrary data to be inscribed to "ordinal" sats, owned and transferred.
BTC Inc. CEO David Bailey praised Ordinals for unlocking "a whole new wave of technical advancement on Bitcoin that was previously deemed impossible."
Despite recent NFT market fluctuations, investments in Ordinals infrastructure are rising. Notably, Xverse wallet recently secured a $5 million funding round led by Jump Capital, with participation from BTC Inc.’s 2140 fund and financial heavyweight Franklin Templeton.
Applications for the Ordinals accelerator are now open via the Bitcoin Frontier Fund's website. The fund aims to finalize its next Ordinals investments by Q4 2023, charting a transformative path for Bitcoin's future through the Ordinals protocol.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zunami Protocol, a rising player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, has become the latest victim of a significant security breach. On Sunday, the DeFi platform confirmed that its liquidity pool on Curve Finance had been targeted by attackers, resulting in a substantial loss exceeding $2 million. 
 
Renowned for its role as a yield farming aggregator for stablecoin staking, the protocol suffered a major setback as its primary “zStables” pool on Curve Finance became the focal point of the attack. This pool facilitates the decentralized exchange (DEX) of stablecoins within the Ethereum network. 
 
 
In the aftermath of the breach, Zunami Protocol issued a warning to its users, advising against the purchase of its Zunami Ether (zETH) or Zunami USD (UZD) stablecoins.

        <updated>2023-08-14T15:33:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chainlink was one of the notable movers on Monday, as the token ended a streak of four consecutive days of declines. The move comes despite the global market cap mostly trading lower to start the week, falling 0.23% as of writing. Dogecoin fell for a second straight session.
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink snapped a four-day losing streak on Monday, despite the global market cap mostly tracking lower to start the week.
 
Following a low of $7.32 on Sunday, LINK/USD jumped to a peak of $7.54 earlier in today’s session.
 
Monday’s move sees chainlink edge closer to a key resistance level of $7.65, which was last truly broken on July 30.
 
 
In addition to this, an upward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages looks imminent.
 
Should this occur, there is a strong possibility that chainlink may not only move past the aforementioned ceiling, but closer to the $8.00 level.
 
At the time of writing, LINK is tracking at $7.49.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
On the other side of the spectrum, dogecoin moved lower for a second straight session, following last week’s bull run.
 
DOGE/USD fell to a low of $0.07409 to start the week, following an earlier high of $0.07615 the day prior.
 
Since peaking at a multi-week high of $0.0776 on Saturday, dogecoin has mostly traded in the red, which appears to be largely due to profit taking.
 
 
This spell of bearish pressure looks to be pushing price towards a key support level around the $0.0730 region.
 
In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovered close to its own floor, at the 50.00 mark.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 50.35, with the meme coin now trading at $0.07458.
