We’ve been spending money like drunken sailors around the world.”
 
Jamie Dimon’s Economic Warning
 
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned about where the U.S. economy is headed at the Barclays 21st Annual Global Financial Services Conference in New York on Monday.
 
The executive cautioned: “I just think people make a mistake to look at real-time numbers and not look at the future. And the future has quantitative tightening. We’ve been spending money like drunken sailors around the world, this war in Ukraine is still going on.” Dimon emphasized:
 

To say the consumer is strong today, meaning you are going to have a booming environment for years, is a huge mistake.
 
“If and when you have a recession, which you’re eventually going to have, you’ll have a normal credit cycle, which I think is quite predictable. In a normal credit cycle, something always does worse than normal,” he described.
 
The JPMorgan boss opined: “There’s a lot of fiscal stimulus taking place out there. And the large one from Covid is still running through. The largest QE is still running through. So we’re still living on that, and that’s really strong. And of course, that drives everything, including business results.”
 
 
Dimon further explained that “businesses feel pretty good because they look at their current results” and see that “they’re not so bad.” However, he cautioned:
 

But those things change. And we don’t know what the full effect of all these things are going to be 12 or 18 months from now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its launch earlier this year, the price of Arbitrum (ARB) has struggled tremendously. The altcoin launched into a budding bear market and as the bears have assumed more control, the ARB token price has dumped even further. This constant decline in price has led to high volumes of panic-selling, and it seems the whales have joined the bandwagon as well.
 
Whales Sell Dump ARB Despite Losses
 
As ARB’s price has continued on a downward trajectory, whales have been selling their holdings into the blood. A report from on-chain tracker Lookonchain shows that some of the largest whales have been selling millions of ARB despite losing millions of dollars in the process.

The core of his argument rests on the timeline of his resignation from the firm and the subsequent charges by the FTC.
 
 
Why Mashinsky Seeks Dismissal
 
In a recent court filing, Mashinsky’s legal team argued that the FTC’s case against their client should be dismissed. The legal defense bases its argument on the assertion that the regulatory body cannot “substantiate a claim that Mashinsky ‘is violating’ or is ‘about to violate’ the law.” 
 
This is primarily because he relinquished his position as the CEO of Celsius on September 27, 2023. Such nuances in legal p…]]></summary>

21co Launches Wrapped Tokens for Cross-Blockchain Liquidity and Security
 

 
A wrapped cryptocurrency is a digital asset hosted on one blockchain that is backed 1:1 by the underlying native asset from a different blockchain. For example, WBTC is an Ethereum-based token fully backed by bitcoin held in Bitgo’s custody. Wrapped crypto assets allow users to access and utilize cryptocurrencies across different blockchains while still benefiting from the security and liquidity of the underlying asset.
