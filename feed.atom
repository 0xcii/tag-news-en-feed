Rachel Green Horn, the head of Marketing and Communications at Filecoin Foundation, highlighted the internet’s vulnerability during the discussion. Following a revealing survey conducted last summer, Horn noted that only 25% of respondents acknowledged the internet’s fragility.

        <updated>2023-11-09T17:38:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blackrock may be taking steps toward obtaining approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the near future. This comes on the heels of the company’s application for an Ishares Ethereum Trust with the Delaware Division of Corporations on Thursday.
 
Speculation Rises on Blackrock’s Preparations for Spot Ether ETF Launch
 
As the world’s largest asset manager by assets under management, Blackrock has formally recorded its Ishares Ethereum Trust with Delaware’s Division of Corporations. The document, dated November 9, 2023, identifies the trust as statutory and acknowledges Blackrock Advisors as the filing party.
 
James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, called attention to the filing on the social platform X, verifying its authenticity. “Multiple people asking ‘is this real’ — yes it’s real,” Seyffart confirmed. “An entity with this name was indeed registered in Delaware. That’s all we can really confirm at this time. Those images are real and from the State of Delaware website.”
 
 
Market watchers speculate that Blackrock is positioning itself to introduce a spot ether ETF, subsequent to regulatory consent for its spot bitcoin ETF initiative. Blackrock’s submission for a spot bitcoin ETF was made on June 15, 2023, and the firm is currently awaiting the SEC’s decision.
 
In the meantime, ethereum’s (ETH) value has seen an uptick of over 5% in the last 24 hours, temporarily crossing the $2,000 mark per unit. The surge was a lot more pronounced following the circulation of the Blackrock story across social media networks. However, only time will reveal Blackrock’s next move with the Ishares ETH trust.

On Thursday, FTT’s value soared, escalating from an early-day trough of $1.22 to a zenith of $2.38. Sparking this ascent were disclosures hinting at Tom Farley, who steered the NYSE Group from 2014 to 2018, as a contender in the pool of prospective buyers for FTX.
 
These speculations were fueled by a Wall Street Journal article quoting sources “familiar with the matter.” Since the announcement, FTT has notched an 82% gain against the dollar, and its 30-day trajectory shows a 111.8% u…]]></summary>

Crypto Futures Market Has Registered Mass Liquidations During Past Day
 
A futures contract is said to be “liquidated” when the derivative exchange with which it’s open forcefully closes it up due to the position amassing losses of a specific degree (the exact percentage could differ from platform to platform).
 
There are two factors that can significantly raise the risk of a contract undergoing liquidation. First and the most obvious one is the volatility of the asset with which the contract is open. A high amount of price fluctuations naturally means that it’s harder to bet in any specific direction.
 
 
The other factor is the leverage that the use…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spurred on by enthusiasm for a forthcoming spot ETF, Bitcoin has catapulted to an 18-month high, surpassing the $37,000 mark Thursday.
The cryptocurrency's resurgence comes after a period of relative disinterest from mainstream market participants. With most eyes on the trial of disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, the news was apocalyptic, with major news sources decrying the death of not just Bitcoin but cryptocurrency. 
Still, the surge in Bitcoin's price can be attributed to a combination of factors, including renewed institutional interest, growing adoption, and a favorable macroeconomic climate. 
Institutional investors, often considered a significant driving force behind Bitcoin's price movements, have once again shown confidence in the digital asset, fueling its upward trajectory.
As global economic uncertainties persist, investors are turning to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. The decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency provides a level of security and autonomy that traditional financial instruments struggle to match.
 
         
         
         
         
    
The $37,000 milestone sets up the more significant $40,000 psychological barrier to be broken, instilling a renewed sense of optimism in the cryptocurrency community. 
But as Bitcoin continues to capture headlines and the attention of both retail and institutional investors, the question on everyone's mind is whether this bullish trend will persist into the new year.]]></summary>
