        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Captain Sidd, a finance writer and explorer of Bitcoin culture.
I want to tell you about a personal transformation that I underwent last year while I crossed the U.S., visiting over 30 Bitcoin meetups around the country. In a little over three months, I covered 11,000 miles of country road on my Harley Davidson and was fortunate to shake thousands of hands.
What I called the “Bitcoin Tour” started with an idea: a great American road trip to see and meet the people who exuded hope during a dark chapter of world history. These people are Bitcoiners, congregating in local bars to share a passion and a way of thinking that’s rare in today’s society.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bears ran through crypto markets on Friday, following reports that Elon Musk’s Spacex had sold all of its bitcoin holdings. It has been suggested that Spacex liquidated over $370 million worth of the cryptocurrency last year. Ethereum dropped below $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) bears pushed the cryptocurrency to a two-month low on Friday, following news that Spacex had liquidated all of its holdings BTC.
 
After peaking at $28,525.11 during Thursday’s session, BTC/USD plunged to a bottom at $25,409.11 late last night.
 
This was the weakest point that bitcoin had fallen to since June 16, when price was near a breakout below $25,000.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that the sell-off came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell deep into oversold territory.
 
The index is now tracking at 20.10, which is the lowest level it has hit since January 2022, which ironically was when Tesla began to sell off its own holdings in bitcoin.
 
Price has somewhat rebounded from earlier lows, and is now trading at $26,341.67.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also moved significantly lower following the news, slipping below $1,600 in the process.
 
ETH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,551.71 on Friday, down nearly $200.00 from Thursday’s peak.
 
This is the weakest reading for ethereum since March 12, when price was trading below the $1,459 level.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Like with BTC above, today’s sell-off has moved the RSI into a bear zone, with a current reading of 21.30.
 
This could work in the favor of bulls looking to buy the dip, and to a degree already has, with ETH now trading at $1,678.05.

In the interview, Pompliano discussed a range of topics with host Brian Sullivan, shedding light on the recent developments within the crypto sphere.
 
Holding steadfast to his convictions, Pompliano dismissed concerns about the volatility of the crypto market, drawing parallels to a similar downturn in 2018 when Bitcoin’s price plummeted from $20,000 to $3,700. 
 
 
 
“I told everyone that this is a very, very resilient industry,” he said. “Young people want these assets and they’re going to continue to buy and it would recover.”
