Within a month, trading volume increased as more banks, funds, and individual traders got a share. One market participant that’s slowly boosting its holdings is Morgan Stanley.
 
 
In its recent 13F-HR/A filing with the SEC, Morgan Stanley declared $272 million worth of Bitcoin ETFs at the end of the third quarter. Although this seems like a sizeable investment, it only accounts for 2% of the total assets in management, now valued at $1.3 trillion.

Back then, few could predict SHIB’s extraordinary 8,000% rally, turning a meme coin into one of history’s most profitable altcoin investments.
 
Fast forward to today, a new contender is emerging that analysts believe could replicate that unprecedented growth. 
 
Dubbed the ‘SHIB killer,’ RCO Finance has turned the heads of many investors who believe in its utility propositions in the DeFi space. Could joining RCOF today offer the same explosive returns as Shiba Inu did just a few years ago?

Elon Musk Is Back To Shilling Dogecoin
 
Elon Musk is back to shilling Dogecoin, although this time in a political way. Musk proposed that the ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ be the name of the department that Donald Trump wants him to head if elected. This name led to the acronym ‘D.O.G.E’, which has brought about a correlation with Dogecoin’s ticker, DOGE.
