In Kazakhstan, regulatory changes forced Canaan’s hand, making them curtail 2 exahash per second (EH/s) of their mining prowess since July. That’s a significant chunk, amounting to half of their mining power across Central Asia and North America. To paint a clearer picture, Canaan’s overall hashrate stood at 4 EH/s as Q1 2023 wrapped up.
