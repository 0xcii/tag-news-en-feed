Ripple’s Unconvincing Business Proposition
 

 
The founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, recently said his perception of XRP and Ripple’s business proposition was “dead wrong.” Novogratz, a billionaire, added that he now sees the so-called XRP army as a real entity that “cares” about the ecosystem and the digital asset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With a potential range forming, Bitcoin is barely maintaining its position above $40,000, contributing to the uncertainty in the crypto markets despite the confidence of the so-called boomers.
 
This unease has been fueled by the recent US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and the imminent decision of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), leading to an escalation in BTC price volatility this week.
 
In line with market expectations, the CPI figures brought relief by revealing a decline in US inflation to 3.1%. This sets the stage for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to provide a summary of economic projections at the December 13 FOMC meeting.
