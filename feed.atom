        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP, the cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, has experienced significant price growth in recent weeks, registering an increase of 14% in the last week alone. This marks an appreciation of over 40% for the asset in the last 30 days, positioning it as the cryptocurrency that has seen the highest increase in price across the entire market in the last seven days. 
 
 
According to the CoinMarketCap, XRP rose from $0.44 to $0.54 during this period, partly driven by increased trading on South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly Korbit and Bithumb, where XRP was the most traded crypto asset on the platforms in the last 24 hours. This positive trend has been linked to increased confidence from investors amid the backdrop of the current lawsuit with the SEC.

Lueth argues that instead of “locking users in,” the metaverse should usher in “a future where they are free to move between platforms and can easily take their assets and identity with them.”
 
‘Walled Garden Systems’ Not Sustainable
 
While interest in the metaverse has seemingly dissipated as evidenced by Meta’s decision to focus on artificial intelligence (AI), Dirk Lueth argues that AI tools can still “provide very interesting enhancements for the metaverse in general.” The Upland co-founder also told Bitcoin.com News what he thinks about “infinite land” metaverses and scarcity.

Despite this choppy price action, a recent blog post by Justin Bennett, trader and analyst of the crypto market suggests that BTC has established “strong” horizontal levels, which are favorable for both scalpers and investors who prefer this period of range or consolidation in the market.

However, the meme coin has since lost most of those gains as the bear market has raged on. With Dogecoin sitting about 90% below its May 2021 all-time high, the question is now whether DOGE will ever reach $0.7 again.
 
Can Dogecoin Reclaim $0.7?
 
Dogecoin is still holding steady as one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the space but a worrying fact about the cryptocurrency is that it has an unlimited supply. Unlike Bitcoin whose supply is capped at 21 million or Ethereum which has enabled a burn mechanism to keep supply down, there is nothing keeping the supply of the meme coin down.
