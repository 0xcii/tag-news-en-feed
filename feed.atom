Armstrong argues that without such laws, firms may be forced to develop in “offshore havens,” where they may be subject to less oversight and regulation.
 
According to a Reuters report, Armstrong made the comments during a conference held by the Innovate Finance industry body, citing the failure of the Bahamas-based FTX exchange last year as evidence of the need for clearer regulations.

The news follows the SEC’s designation of several crypto assets as securities, including the case against Terraform Labs, which insists that LUNA and UST were sold as unregistered securities. Additionally, a lawsuit initiated by New York attorney general Letitia James against Kucoin insists that ethereum is also an unregistered security.
