        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Portugal's data regulator, CNPD, has ordered Worldcoin  
to cease collecting biometric data for 90 days, citing concerns over citizens'  
data protection rights.  According to a report by Reuters, CNPD highlighted  
risks related to unauthorized data collection from minors and inadequate mechanisms to erase the information and data collected from users. 
However, Worldcoin refuted the claims of non-compliance,  
citing ongoing efforts to address the regulatory issues, including the alleged sign-ups of underage users. The  
iris-scanning project, which offers free cryptocurrency in exchange for facial  
scans, has attracted over 4.5 million users globally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US federal prosecutors announced charges against crypto  
exchange KuCoin and two of its founders for allegedly violating anti-money  
laundering (AML) laws today (Tuesday). According to the indictment, KuCoin  
operated in the US without proper registration and failed to maintain an  
adequate AML program.
No Arrests Made despite Charges 
The indictment, brought forth by the US Department of  
Justice (DOJ), accuses KuCoin and its founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang, of  
running a money-transmitting business serving over 30 million customers without  
implementing a know-your-customer (KYC) or AML program until 2023. It was noted  
that even after the implementation of a KYC program, existing customers were  
not subject to its requirements. Despite these allegations, neither Gan nor

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem is gaining traction, as different metrics suggest that investors are more bullish on the meme coin than ever. One of these metrics is the latest development, which shows that the number of SHIB tokens held on exchanges has drastically reduced. 
 
Shiba Inu On Exchanges Drops To 2-Year Low
 
Data from crypto analytics firm Glassnode shows that the amount of SHIB held on exchanges has dropped to its lowest level since March 2022. This underscores the bullish sentiment among SHIB investors, as the decline in the meme coin’s supply invariably means that these investors are choosing to hold for the long term rather than offloading their holdings anytime soon. 
 
 
Data from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment also shows the steady decline in the SHIB supply …]]></summary>

 Names can be both liberating and confining. When mankind gives something a name, we mark it with a label that helps us discuss our shared environment and experience. At the same time, a label can obscure something in preconceived notions. Labels can make it more difficult for us collectively to understand what something is. 
 In 2008, a pseudonymous inventor named Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”1. The paper outlines a novel distributed network system, called Bitcoin, that acts as an immutable digital ledger. There are many ways to describe what the fundamental innovation here really was.
