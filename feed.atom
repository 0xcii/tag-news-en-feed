A Landmark Move For Bitcoin Rights
 
The bill, officially known as House Bill 2481, received a decisive vote of 176 to 26, with 76 Democrats and all 100 Republicans backing the measure. 
 
The bill aims to protect the rights of individuals to self-custody their digital assets, affirm their ability to use Bitcoin for payments, and establish explicit guidelines for the taxation of Bitcoin transactions. 
 
 
After the upcoming election, the bill will advance to the Republican-led Pennsylvania Senate, and if approved, it will be sent to Governor Josh Shapiro for final approval.
