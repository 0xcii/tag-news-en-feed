Inscriptions have emerged as a creative bypass on networks like Bitcoin, which lack native token support. By embedding text in standard blockchain transactions and employing an external numbering system, these inscription-based tokens offer a unique approach to token creation and movement.
 
Initially developed for Bitcoin, their utility has extended to other blockchains such as Arbitrum, Polygon PoS, and so on, mainly due to the cost-effectiveness of transferring these tokens comp…]]></summary>

Saga Phone Resurgence: BONK’s Rise Turns Solana Device Into Hot Commodity
 
The Solana Saga phone, once struggling to find its market, has seen its fortunes reversed this week, with units selling for as much as $5,000 on Ebay, a staggering increase from its discounted price earlier this summer. This dramatic shift in demand is primarily attributed to the explosive rise of the Solana-based meme coin, BONK, which experienced more than a 10,000% surge in the past two months.
 
The Saga phone, initially released earlier this year with a price tag of $1,000 and later reduced to $599, had faced disappointi…]]></summary>

Taking to X on Dec. 17, the CEO said those complaining “can’t stop JPEGs” on the world’s most valuable network, adding that those who try to stop them “will only do it in worse ways.”  
 
“JPEGs” Is Good: Will Force Innovation And Adoption Of Layer-2s
 
Central to Back’s arguments lies the recently rising cost of transacting on the mainnet. Though the most valuable, Bitcoin has remained unchanged, especially on throughput, for the last 15 years. Under light loads, Bitcoin can only process seven transactions every second (TPS), a concern considering its role in the sphere.
