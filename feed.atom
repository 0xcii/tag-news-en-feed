        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The meme coin market is undergoing a dramatic downturn, with prominent cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) facing substantial decline. Due to the market volatility and broader decline, the total market capitalization of meme coins dropped below $40 billion, signaling a notable decrease in investors demand for these coins. 
 
Market Crash By Over 12%
 
Recent severe declines in meme coins have exposed the market’s inherent fragility, where the value of most coins is largely influenced by speculations and social sentiment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) is navigating through a storm of fear and uncertainty, with recent volatile price action causing significant shakeouts among traders and investors. Since August 24, BTC has experienced a sharp retrace of over 12%, plunging below the $60,000 mark—a crucial psychological level that often serves as a pivot point for both price action and market sentiment.
 
 
As BTC fluctuates, parallels are drawn between its current structure and the 2016 bull market. With historical patterns suggesting a potential breakout, the question on everyone’s mind is whether Bitcoin is poised for a repeat of its past performance. As the market watches closely, the coming weeks could reveal if BTC will surge to new heights or face further challenges.

Shiba Inu Could Rise To As High As $0.00014
 
Zach Humphries mentioned in a video on his YouTube channel that Shiba Inu can “definitely” enjoy a 10x run from its current price level, meaning that it can reach a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.00014 in this bull run. A rise to such a price level also means that Shiba Inu will come close to hitting a $100 billion market cap, which the crypto analyst also noted is possible.
