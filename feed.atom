        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump spoke to CNBC about his stance on Bitcoin today, revealing that he occasionally accepts Bitcoin as payment. In the interview, Trump acknowledged the growing popularity of Bitcoin and that "its taken its own life." While Trump did not provide specific details about the frequency or context in which he accepts Bitcoin, his statement underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of BTC.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 11, 2024
  
  
  
"I sometimes will let people pay through Bitcoin," the former President Trump stated. "If you think of it, its an additional form of currency.  And I used to say I want one currency, I want the dollar, I don't want people leaving the dollar. And I feel that way but I will tell you it has taken on a life."
Trump's acknowledgment of Bitcoin as a payment option comes at a time when more businesses and individuals are embracing Bitcoin as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Despite his past skepticism about Bitcoin, Trump's recent comments suggest a potential shift in his perspective.
The statement from Trump adds to the ongoing discussion about the role of Bitcoin in the traditional financial system. As one of the most prominent political figures globally, Trump's remarks may influence public perception and further fuel the adoption of Bitcoin.
Overall, Trump's acknowledgment of accepting Bitcoin payments highlights the evolving landscape of this new asset class and the integration of BTC into mainstream financial practices.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/us-district-court-closes-case-on-alleged-crypto-asset-trading-scheme/"/>
        <updated>2024-03-11T16:00:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US District Court for the Western District of Washington  
has entered a final judgment against Sameer Ramani for engaging in insider  
trading. Ramani was implicated in a scheme to trade ahead of multiple  
announcements concerning at least nine crypto asset securities slated for  
trading on the Coinbase platform.
Coinbase Confidentiality Breached: Insider Details  
Disclosed
The case stemmed from allegations brought forward by the  
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which asserted that Ramani received  
privileged information from his associate, Ishan Wahi, a former product manager  
at Coinbase. Wahi allegedly orchestrated the timing and content of public  
listing announcements, divulging sensitive details to Ramani and Nikhil Wahi,  
his brother. These disclosures included information regarding upcoming crypto  
asset listings, which were treated as confidential by Coinbase.
The complaint, covering the period from June 2021 to April  
2022, alleged that Ramani and Nikhil Wahi leveraged the insider information to  
purchase at least 25 crypto assets, nine of which were securities, ahead of  
public announcements. Subsequently, they purportedly sold these assets shortly  
after the announcements, profiting from the subsequent price increases.
Disgorgement and Civil Penalty Ordered
The judgment, entered on the basis of default, prohibits  
Ramani from violating anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and  
associated rules. Additionally, Ramani has been ordered to pay a disgorgement  
totaling $817,602, along with a civil penalty amounting to $1,635,204. Notably,  
the court had previously issued final judgments against Ishan and Nikhil Wahi,  
thereby concluding the litigation surrounding this matter. Daniel Maher and  
Peter Lallas led the SEC's litigation efforts, under the supervision of James  
Connor and Olivia Choe.

By lowering the number of SHIB tokens in circulation, the Shiba Inu burn initiative seeks to decrease the overall supply of the token. Consequently, this makes the digital asset more valuable and possibly raises the price of SHIB.
 
Shiba Inu Burn Initiative Sees Uptick Of Over 300%
 
According to the burn tracker Shibburn, the last 24 hours have seen a significant spike in the Shiba Inu burn rate. Data from Shibburn reveals that the burn initiative recorded a 335.94% increase, fueling optimism among the SHIB community and crypto enthusiasts.
