After a dismal 2022, the price of Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, has been inching upward over the past few weeks.
 
According to data from Coingecko, Bitcoin is trading at $22,709 at the time of writing, an increase of 15% over the past week.
 
However, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon remains unconvinced of the crypto’s performance. In fact, he has always been.
 
As far back September 2017, the chief executive had maintained an antagonistic stance against Bitcoin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the number of ransomware hits may not have decreased significantly, the revenue from such attacks has fallen sharply last year, according to Chainalysis. The blockchain forensics firm believes that to a large extent the trend can be attributed to more of the targeted organizations refusing to pay the perpetrators.
 
Chainalysis Registers Significant Decline in Revenue From Ransomware Attacks
 
Over the course of 2022, ransomware actors have managed to extort at least $456.8 million from victims, Chainalysis revealed in a report published Thursday. The estimated amount is down from $765.6 million the year before, the analytics company pointed out, noting that the true total is likely much higher, as many crypto addresses controlled by attackers have yet to be identified.

Federal authorities have seized $150 million in assets related to FTX co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, a large chunk of which comes in the form of Robinhood stock, a court filing revealed Friday.
 
Stocks, cash, and other assets totaling almost $700 million have now been seized by U.S. officials in connection with the ongoing probe.
 
The U.S. Department of Justice disclosed the confiscation of Robinhood shares earlier this month, but on Friday it presented a more comprehensive list of sequestered assets, including cash held at several banks and assets placed at the cryptocurrency…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An Indian government official says that there is currently nothing that outlaws crypto in India “as long as you follow the legal process.” Meanwhile, the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has stressed that “cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value.”
 
Indian Government Official on Crypto
 
Indian government official Rajeev Chandrasekhar talked about cryptocurrency Thursday at an event in Bengaluru. Chandrasekhar currently serves as both India’s Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology and Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. He is also a member of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament.
 
He explained that India has no issue with cryptocurrencies if all laws are followed, Reuters reported, quoting him as saying:
 

There is nothing today that outlaws crypto as long as you follow the legal process.
 
The Indian government has not yet established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. In December last year, the government told parliament that crypto legislation “can be effective only with significant international collaboration.” Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said the government plans to discuss crypto regulations with the G20 countries.
 
However, crypto income is already taxed at 30% in India, and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) is levied on crypto transactions. Earlier this month, the government revealed that it is launching a crypto awareness campaign.
 
Meanwhile, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has recommended a complete ban on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week that “Cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value,” warning that “it will undermine the authority of the RBI and lead to the dollarization of the economy.” He even expects crypto to cause the next financial crisis if it is not banned.

The CEO of global investment bank JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, reiterated his skepticism about bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Thursday. The JPMorgan executive claimed:
 

Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud. It’s a pet rock.
 

 
Regarding the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Dimon commented: “I’m not surprised at all. I call them a decentralized Ponzi scheme. The hype around this thing has been extraordinary.”
