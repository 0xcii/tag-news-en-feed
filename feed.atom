Kagel, who pled guilty to conspiracy to commit commodity fraud in May this year, received his sentencing on October 8 from Judge Gloria Navarro of the Las Vegas Federal Court.
 
Currently in hospice care at a senior facility in Las Vegas due to declining health, Kagel will serve his probation at the facility. Should his health improve, he must wear a monitoring device if allowed to leave.

Among those refuting the claim is Billy Markus, co-founder of Dogecoin and known online as Shibetoshi Nakamoto. Taking to X, Markus stated, “It’s not Peter Todd bro.”
