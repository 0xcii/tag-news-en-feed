A California federal court judge has greenlighted the lawsuit but denied a summary judgment, meaning a jury will hear the case.
A Statement Made in 2017
In an interview with Canada’s BNN Bloomberg in 2017, Garlinghouse mentioned that he was “very, very long” on XRP, the digital token of Ripple. However, the lawsuit alleges that, in reality, he “sold millions of XRP” in that same year.
In his order on 20 June, Judge Phyllis Hamilton dismissed four allegations around Ripple’s “failure to register XRP as a security.”
Ripple is already facing a separate lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleges that XRP is a security. Last Ju…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Has Been Mostly Negative In The Past Month
 
As CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn pointed out in a post on X, the Net Taker Volume suggests a lack of strong taker buy volume in the past month.
 
The “Net Taker Volume” is an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin taker buy and taker sell volumes. Naturally, the two volumes measure the buy and sell orders filled by takers in perpetual swaps.
 
 
When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the taker buy volume is greater than the taker sell volume right now. Such a trend implies the majority of the market shares a bullish sentiment.
