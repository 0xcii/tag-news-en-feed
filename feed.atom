        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP has now broken past the $0.6 price mark again after a week of price correction among major cryptocurrencies. The price increase, led by Bitcoin, has seen most cryptocurrencies turning green since the weekend.
 
XRP, being one of the largest crypto assets by market cap, has been included in this increase. Although modest compared to its counterparts, XRP pushed to $0.6257 in the past 24 hours, representing a 5.88% price increase.  
 
According to popular XRP analysts, the recent move looks like the start of an extended bullish action for the cryptocurrency. Particularly, analyst EGRAG crypto has identified a three-camel hump pattern that could launch XRP to a target zone around $1 to $1.3.
