major retail bank in the United Kingdom has blocked cryptocurrency  
transactions. Following Santander and NatWest, it is now JPMorgan's British  
retail arm, Chase UK. Although the decision was officially made due to the  
increasing number of cryptocurrency-related crimes, it fits into a broader

According to a new Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) study, the country’s nearly two-year-old e-naira central bank digital currency (CBDC) poses a risk to financial stability.

Solana Overpaying For A Higher Bandwidth?
 
Hoffman’s breakdown implies that Solana, unlike other popular networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, is paying exorbitantly for the cost of bandwidth. In blockchain, bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transferred every second. This figure varies with legacy networks, including Ethereum and Bitcoin, having some of the lowest in the sphere.
