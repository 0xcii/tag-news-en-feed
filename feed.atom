        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week was a particularly good week for DOGE. The meme coin experienced a surge in trading volume during the week that allowed it to successfully surpass the $0.22 price mark for the first time since November 2021. This spike saw the price of DOGE increasing by as much as 33% during the week, outperforming the likes of Bitcoin and other large market-cap cryptocurrencies. 
 
 
Interestingly, the price surge was on the back of increased activity from whales, as indicated by on-chain data. The increased activity led to an increased accumulation trend from this cohort of traders, as noted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez. According to the analyst, Dogecoin whales purchased 1.40 billion DOGE over the past two weeks, worth around $280 million.

However, on-chain data indicates SOL is still going on strong, particularly in the stablecoin sector. Stablecoin transfers on the Solana chain reveal the blockchain steadily processing more transactions than Ethereum every day, registering $411.2 billion more in trading volume in the past week.

On Friday, March 29, the Prisma Finance hacker transferred some of the proceeds from the theft to crypto mixer Tornado Cash in multiple transactions. According to PeckShield, $2.7 million in ETH was moved in one transaction and $3.8 million in another.
 
What’s most interesting is the hacker sent an on-chain message barely six hours after the attack through one of the addresses linked to the heist, claiming they are a “white hat hacker.” And the exploiter has continued to send on-chain messages to Prisma Finance’s team since the theft occurred.
