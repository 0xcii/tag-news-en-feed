In an interview, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund said the global economy will face a challenging year in 2023.
 
In doing so, Georgieva described China‘s slowing growth as the biggest threat this year, with the world economy’s other main growth engines – the U.S. and Europe – also set to experience a slowdown.
 
“For the first time in 40 years, China’s growth in 2022 is likely to be at or below global growth,” Georgieva said. A slowdown is already evident in the EU, triggered by the war between Ukraine and Russia, she said.

As the 2022 chapter closes, it’s time to turn our eyes to what’s coming in 2023. Here are some themes I’m seeing for Bitcoin in 2023.
Regulatory Overreach
The Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule is forcing exchanges and bitcoin service providers to document and share ever-more information about customer transactions.

Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio 72-Hour MA Has Been Going Down Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the bitcoin exchange ratio on a 72-hour moving average has been on a decline. The “exchange whale ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 Bitcoin transactions to exchanges and the total exchange inflow.
 
Since the ten largest deposits to exchanges are usually from the whales, this metric tells us what part of the total exchange inflows is being contributed by these humongous holders. Thus, when the value of the indicator is high, it means whales are making up a high part of the inflow…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probably the most pressing question for the XRP community at the moment is how the lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission will end. In addition to a ruling in favor of Ripple, the community is also hoping for a settlement that could impose a penalty on Ripple but classify all present XRP sales as non-security.
 
Attorney John E. Deaton, who is representing 75,000 XRP investors in the lawsuit with an amicus brief, recently put up a poll on Twitter about what outcome the community expects in 2023. Out of 18,000 votes, 59% of people said they expected a settlement between Ripple and the SEC.
 
Surprisingly, Deaton has changed his mind and is among the 39% who expect a verdict by Judge Analisa Torres. As the attorney explains, he originally believed that the …]]></summary>

The cryptocurrency market started 2023 with the prolonged unfavorable conditions that have characterized the industry over the past year continuing in place.
 
Yet, despite the gloomy economic environment, a number of digital assets stand out as having the ability to make impressive gains.
 
Here are the top five cryptocurrencies that could experience a substantial bull run:

Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of FTX, turned to social media this week to deny his involvement in a flurry of strange transfers and token exchanges from wallets associated with Alameda Research.
 
To counter claims that he has been taking money out of Alameda wallets, he stated he’s not the one making the transactions.
 

“I’m not and couldn’t be moving any of those funds; I don’t have access to them anymore.”
 
Along with sister company FTX, Alameda Research is the cryptocurrency trading firm that went belly up in November.

Philion insists that the lack of such secure solutions has constrained the growth and use of defi products.
 
Lack of Communication Between Chains
 

 
In written responses sent to Bitcoin.com News, Philion claimed that the large-scale, cross-chain experimentation primarily seen in 2020 and 2021 potentially explains why more than $2 billion has been lost via the so-called bridge exploits of the past 12 months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Economist Peter Schiff has predicted that the U.S. dollar will have “one of its worst years ever” in 2023, warning that the inflation problem is “about to get much worse.” He also shared his prediction about the worst-performing sectors of the stock market this year.
 
Peter Schiff’s 2023 Economic Predictions
 
Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff shared his 2023 predictions about the U.S. economy, the dollar, and the stock market in a series of tweets Friday.
 
“The U.S. dollar index may have had a strong year, but it ended the year on a six-month low, down 10% from its November high,” he began, elaborating:
 

This weakness will likely continue in 2023, with the dollar having one of its worst years ever. If I’m right the inflation problem is about to get much worse.
 
Schiff also disagreed with Wharton University’s finance professor Jeremy Siegel who shared his economic view on CNBC last week.
 
“Jeremy Siegel is wrong,” Schiff contended. Siegel “thinks falling real estate prices means the inflation threat is over. That’s falling asset prices. Consumer prices will keep rising, including those associated with homeownership like rent, mortgage rates, insurance, taxes, utilities, and maintenance,” Schiff argued.
 
Regarding the stock market, Schiff predicted:
 

The worst-performing sectors of the stock market in 2022 will likely repeat as the worst-performing sectors in 2023.
 
Schiff has repeatedly warned about the U.S. economy and the dollar crashing. In October, he cautioned about the rising national debt that the U.S. cannot repay. “We’re going to default,” he warned. “We have much more debt now than we had in 2008 … so this is going to be a much bigger crisis when the defaults start,” he described. The economist also predicted that the Federal Reserve’s recent actions could lead to market crashes, a massive financial crisis, and a severe recession.
