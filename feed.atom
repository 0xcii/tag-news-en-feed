Authorities arrested Bankman-Fried on Monday, December 12, in The Bahamas – where FTX is headquartered – after the crypto tycoon was criminally charged by U.S. prosecutors.
 
Bankman-Fried was arrested without any untoward incident.
 
“Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the U.S. government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the southern district of New York,” Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, tweeted, according to Agence France-Presse via The Philippine Star.

The frustrating reality that 99 out of 100 people on the street still don’t “get” Bitcoin is driving a lot of Bitcoiners to conclude that there is no cure for Cassandra’s Curse other than time and patience.

Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has been arrested in the Bahamas by local authorities.
The arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the U.S. that it had filed criminal charges against SBF, per a statement from the Attorney General of the Bahamas. SBF’s extradition to the U.S. will likely be requested.
SBF has been on the news for a couple of years, but it wasn’t until recently that such coverage turned a dark corner. The Jane Street alumni turned crypto founder ultimately led his creations, FTX and Alameda Research, to insolvency as SBF’s severe mismanagement of users’ funds came to light. He then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and resigned as CEO.
The disgraced entrepreneur then went on an unusual interview spree, talking about the companies and his version of the story to as many journalists willing to give him a stage. Notably, however, SBF would only deflect from answering the tougher questions, reaching a point where he said he “didn’t knowingly commingle users’ funds.”
Now, the story is set to take a new twist as prosecutors move to unseal the indictment on Tuesday morning. A source familiar with the matter told The New York Times that charges brought against SBF include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.]]></summary>
