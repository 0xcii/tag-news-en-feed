        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto analytics platform Arkham Intelligence claims to have found on-chain addresses associated with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. This revelation comes amidst the ongoing battle between asset management firm Grayscale and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over converting the Bitcoin Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).
 
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, with the ticker GBTC, is an investment product that offers investors exposure to Bitcoin without having to purchase or hold the cryptocurrency directly. In the wake of its recent victory against the SEC, the asset manager is looking – and might be able – to transform its GBTC product into a spot ETF.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum continued to trade around a key price floor of $1,630 on Thursday, as price uncertainty in the market remained high. Volatility has slowed in recent days, leading to crypto prices mostly trending sideways. Bitcoin fell below a support point of its own earlier in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was trading marginally lower on Thursday, as the cryptocurrency moved below a key point of support.
 
BTC/USD bottomed out at $25,404.36 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after peaking at $25,953.02.
 
The decline saw bitcoin fall under a price floor of $25,600, before bulls intervened to send the cryptocurrency higher.
 
 
At the time of writing, BTC is now trading at $25,701.34, which sees price below $26,000 for a third straight day.
 
Although sentiment has been mostly bearish, price stability has largely remained, with traders so far avoiding a drop under $25,000.
 
This could be tested as we head towards next week, with several key economic announcements set to be released in the United States.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) tracked close to a support point of $1,630 for a fourth straight session, as traders continued to fight to secure marker momentum.
 
Following a low $1,611.15 on Wednesday, ETH/USD spiked to a peak of $1,656.93 earlier in the day.
 
Price has since slipped, with the world’s second largest cryptocurrency now trading around the $1,626.20 level.
 
 
The decline came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovered near a floor of its own at 36.00.
 
Looking at the chart, the index is now tracking at 36.30, with a move lower likely to trigger an increase in bearish pressure.
 
A move below $1,600 remains a real possibility for the coming days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On September 7, 2021, El Salvador made headlines worldwide by becoming the first country to pass a groundbreaking Bitcoin law, officially recognizing the cryptocurrency as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.
This historic move, spearheaded by President Nayib Bukele, promised to revolutionize the nation's financial landscape, and so far, signs suggest Bitcoin is building a presence domestically with restaurants, shops, and even hotels accepting Bitcoin payments.
President Nayib Bukele's vision for El Salvador was clear: harness the power of Bitcoin to boost financial inclusion, attract investment, and reduce the costs associated with remittances. The law was met with both excitement and skepticism, though any rumors the move would cause the country to default have proved exaggerated.

The lawsuit comes as both parties grapple with the repayment of more than $610 million in loans that reached maturity back in May.
 
According to Genesis Global Capital’s lawyers, the roots of this dispute date back to a “master loan agreement” established in 2019 between Genesis and DCG. This agreement laid the groundwork for what has now escalated into a complex legal battle. 
 
According to recent reports, Genesis claims that it extended loans totaling over 18,000 bitcoins to DCG in 2022, subsequently converting this debt into a fixed-term loan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Israeli law enforcement recently raided the offices of a company accused of producing software used by criminals to defraud crypto investors of millions of dollars. Some six suspects were arrested following the raid on a company that is reportedly operated by the country’s infamous crime families.
 
‘Sting Software’
 
The Israeli police’s National Cyber Crime Unit recently raided an IT company whose so-called “sting software” has helped criminal syndicates to steal millions of dollars from crypto investors. According to a Ynet News report, six individuals were arrested while dozens were taken in for questioning.
 
According to the report, the raided company is believed to be operated by the country’s infamous crime families. In his remarks following the raid, Dudi Katz, the head of Lahav 433’s National Cyber Crime Unit, said:
 
“We were able to stem the tide of this crime wave and bring down hundreds of call centers. This operation spanned internationally and was unique in scope, including cooperation with German police forces.”
 
In addition to German law enforcement, members of the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority as well as the Israeli Tax Authority were also involved in the raid.
 

 
Detained Suspect Denies Charges
 
As stated in the report, criminal syndicates would lure unsuspecting victims with the promise of high returns on crypto investment. The victims who showed an interest were then given purported credentials to access or control their investment portfolio. However, the report said when victims attempted to withdraw or cash out their profits they would realize that this option was not available.
 
Meanwhile, one unnamed suspect’s legal representatives Shay Roda and Uri Goldman said their client rejects the charges. They said as the investigations into the company continued, they would be able to relay the suspect’s “message to the relevant cyber investigators.”
