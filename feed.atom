        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent crackdown on illicit transactions involving crypto assets, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) arrested Rui-Siang Lin, a 23-year-old individual from Taiwan. Lin, who also goes by the names Pharoah and Faro, is accused of owning and operating a dark web drug marketplace known as the “Incognito Market.” 
 
The platform allegedly facilitated anonymous crypto-based transactions of illegal narcotics with a total value of more than $100 million worldwide.
 
$100 Million Crypto Operation Exposed
 
According to the complaint and indictment, Incognito Market emerged in October 2020 as an online narcotics bazaar operating on the dark web.
