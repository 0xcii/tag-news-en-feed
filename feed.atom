Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Hasn’t Observed Any Uplift Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, whales have not intervened in the latest decline in BTC so far. The indicator of interest here is the “exchange whale ratio,” which measures the ratio between the sum of the ten largest transactions to exchanges, and the total exchange deposits in the market.
 
Since the top 10 transfers to these platforms are generally coming from the whales, the ratio’s value can tell us about how the deposit activity of these humongous investors currently compares with that of the entire market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana ended a two-day losing streak on Wednesday, as the token surged by as much as 7% in today’s session. The move came following a two-week low on Tuesday, as markets slipped after recent highs. XRP also edged higher, and currently hovers near a key price floor.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) recovered from a two-week low on Wednesday, as bulls took advantage of yesterday’s dip in price.
 
After slipping to a bottom of $22.86 on Tuesday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $24.56 earlier in the day.
 
The token has mostly traded lower in recent weeks, after surging to an eight-month high above $30.00 on June 14.
 
 
Today’s rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) bounced on a floor at the 52.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 57.51, and looks set to be heading for a ceiling at 60.00.
 
Should it reach this point, there is a strong possibility SOL will be above $25.00.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was trading close to a key support point during today’s session, as price continued to consolidate.
 
XRP/USD peaked at $0.7141 earlier in today’s session, after slipping to an intraday low of $0.6961 the day prior.
 
Since surging to $0.9479 earlier this month, XRP has mostly traded between a floor at $0.7000 and ceiling of $0.8200.
 
 
Following a brief move below the aforementioned support point, XRP bulls have reentered to push the price higher.
 
This coincided with price strength finding a stable zone at 57.00, helping increase bullish prospects.
 
The next target to maintain today’s slight rebound will be to capture the $0.7500 resistance level.
