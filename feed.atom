Meme coins have moved to the forefront of crypto over the last month and this increased volume has inadvertently led to a rise in the ETH burn rate. To put this in perspective, the data from Ultrasound Money – a website dedicated to Ethereum’s activities post-Merge – shows that a total of 561,656 ETH has been burned since the Merge occurred 231 days ago.

"There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>

That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>
