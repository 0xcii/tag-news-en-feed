Among the most talked-about presales in 2024 are PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), two meme coins that are quickly gaining traction as top contenders for the most promising investments of the year.
 
Why PlayDoge (PLAY) is Turning Heads 
PlayDoge (PLAY) has distinguished itself as a unique play-to-earn (P2E) platform that combines the nostalgic charm of 90s digital pets with the lucrative potential of blockchain technology. As its presale draws to a close, investors are rushing to secure their tokens before PlayDoge (PLAY) hits the exchanges. The token’s innovative approach to gaming and rewards has made it one of the most anticipated launches in the meme coin space.

Although the exact financials of the deal were not revealed, it was labelled a “multi-million dollar sponsorship deal.”
Crypto Money Is Flowing into Football
The sponsorship deal with Inter Milan came only a few days after BlockDAG spent $10 million to partner with Borussia Dortmund (BVB), one of Germany’s largest football clubs. For Inter Milan, it was the second crypto deal, as the football club had already onboarded Gate.io as its sleeve sponsor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin historically tends to have a tough time during the month of September, as quite often it delivers negative returns to traders. Despite the gloomy trend, the current forecast of BTC price is surprisingly rosy, anticipating it to rise 30% by October 1, 2024. But will this bullish forecast last, or is Bitcoin in for yet another raw deal in the weeks ahead?
 
 
BTC prices have not been able to stay above $60,000. The coin was most recently rejected at the psychological level on August 27. It then went through a quick 10% correction over the next two days. That drop helped wipe out $140 million in leveraged BTC longs. Speculators now join the chorus of many wondering: why can’t Bitcoin break through $60,000?
