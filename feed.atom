Bitcoin
 
The technical indicators present an optimistic outlook for bitcoin (BTC). The oscillators, including the relative strength index at 62 and the Stochastic at 83, currently indicate a neutral stance. However, the commodity channel index at press time at 123 suggests a growing momentum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a decision by the Podgorica High Court, ex-Terraform Labs chief executive Do Hyeong Kwon (Do Kwon) is set to be extradited following his four-month incarceration in Montenegro for fabricating travel papers. The extradition bids originate from both the United States and South Korea, with the final determination of Kwon’s destination resting in the hands of the court’s Justice Minister.
 
Judge Will Decide on Do Kwon’s Extradition
 
The notorious Do Kwon is poised for extradition upon completing his sentence in Montenegro, though his ultimate destination remains uncertain. A recent press release reveals that South Korea seeks Kwon for engaging in fraudulent and unfair trading activities. Additionally, the U.S. also desires his extradition for similar infractions, including securities fraud and market manipulation.
 
According to the press release, Kwon agreed to be extradited to South Korea. However, the court noted that due to multiple extradition requests, the Podgorica High Court must make the final determination. “The final decision on the matter will be made by the Minister of Justice of Montenegro,” the announcement specifies.
 
 
The announcement from the Podgorica High Court further clarifies, “If the Minister of Justice allows the final extradition of the aforementioned accused, the extradition will be executed after the completion of the criminal sentence imposed by the Basic Court in Podgorica in a case against the same individual for the criminal offense of document forgery.”

Court Upholds Sam Bankman-Fried’s Bail Revocation
 
In a mandate dated November 21, the Appellate Court once again upheld the decision to revoke SBF’s bail. The court based the mandate on the Appellate Court’s findings back in September when SBF’s lawyers appealed Judge Kaplan’s ruling on the bail revocation. Then, the Circuit Judges found that Judge Kaplan was right in concluding that the defendant attempted to tamper with witnesses.

Every major bank you know or are a client of is centralized and, thus, controlled by a central authority. This means you can freely own and control your funds, but your bank account is reliant on banking intermediaries. 
 
With Bitcoin, this isn’t the case. Without intermediaries and by utilizing blockchain technology, transaction fees are reduced significantly, and you can transfer your funds without geographic restrictions. However, it doesn’t mean you can buy Bitcoin anonymously without effort. You still have to provide personal details due to financial regulations, even in the crypto world.
