        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move to regulate the fast-growing crypto industry, South Africa’s financial regulator, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), has announced a year-end deadline for mandatory licensing of all crypto exchanges operating in the nation. 
 
The impending regulatory change comes as an effort to mitigate the potential financial risks associated with crypto transactions for South African consumers. With this, South Africa, Africa’s most advanced economy, becomes the first in the continent to enforce such a licensing requirement. 
 
The move underlines the nation’s ongoing commitment to keeping pace with the evolving digital landscape while ensuring a regulatory framework that can enhance consumer protection in the crypto space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved back above the $31,000 level on July 4th, as U.S. traders celebrated the Independence Day holiday. As a result of the rally, the cryptocurrency remained near a one-year high in today’s session. Ethereum consolidated after Monday’s gains.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved closer to a fresh one-year high on Tuesday, as U.S. markets closed in celebration of the July 4th holiday.
 
Following a low of $30,586.51 to start the week, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $31,375.61 earlier in the session.
 
The move saw bitcoin edge closer to last Friday’s high at $31,443, which was its strongest point since June last year.
 
 
Earlier momentum has since faded, as the relative strength index (RSI) collided with a resistance level at 70.00.
 
The index is now tracking at 68.43 and appears to be heading for a support point at the 66.00 mark.
 
Should it reach this point, there is a strong possibility that bitcoin will be trading around the $30,500 level.
 
 
Ethereum
 
After moving towards $2,000 on Monday, ethereum (ETH) slipped in today’s session, falling below $1,950.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,949.15 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after peaking at $1,974.78.
 
The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has since rebounded and is once again closing in on a multi-month high.
 
 
In order to get there, ETH bulls will need to take price strength above an upcoming ceiling at the 64.00 zone.
 
Currently, the RSI has a reading of 62.59, which is its highest level since April 19, when the price was above $2,100.
 
Some believe that ETH could head back toward this point in the coming weeks.

For years, you could basically only do two things on the Bitcoin network: You could save BTC or you could spend it. Then, a late 2021 privacy upgrade had the unintended consequence of allowing data storage on the Bitcoin blockchain, resulting in NFT-like inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens, both applying Ordinal Theory for asset tracking. 
The popularity of NFT-like Ordinal inscriptions and the experimental BRC-20 token standard has driven up transaction costs across the Bitcoin network. The frothy demand for “stamping” limited block space with new data pushed transaction costs so high that in May 2023, Binance twice had to pause BTC withdrawals, a risky and undesira…]]></summary>

“Cryptocurrencies are high-risk. Please study and understand the risks of cryptocurrencies thoroughly. because you may lose the entire amount invested,” the latest Thai SEC guidelines state.
 
 
In addition to disclosing the potential risks, the guidelines state that starting Aug. 30 digital asset business operators will be barred from “providing services or supporting deposit-taking [and] lending services.” This means the Thai crypto industry participants will not be allowed to offer interest on deposits or lend user funds.
