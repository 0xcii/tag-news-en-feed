        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With President Joe Biden stepping out of the race for the White House, attention now turns to Vice President Kamala Harris as a potential Democratic nominee and her stance on supporting innovation within the crypto industry. 
 
Nonetheless, the market is divided on whether her ascendancy will bring forth a more favorable environment for cryptocurrencies or if the regulatory crackdown experienced over the past years under Biden’s administration will continue. 
 
Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has weighed in on the matter, suggesting a potential shift in policy under a Harris administration. Meanwhile, analysts speculate that a return of Donald Trump to the White House could lead to a weaker dollar, which some believe could benefit Bitcoin and other crypto assets.
