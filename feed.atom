The staggering transaction, valued at $46 million, saw the tokens discreetly whisked away to an undisclosed wallet, according to blockchain tracker Whale Alert. This sudden shift, coupled with another whale offloading 25.7 million XRP to Bitstamp, fueled fears of an imminent fire sale, potentially pushing the price further south.
