In its latest decision to further streamline the sector, the Japanese Crypto Asset Business Association (JCBA) is making strides in redefining the rules around Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).
 
JCBA’s Vision For The ICO Market
 
The JCBA’s latest endeavor centers around the proposal of an overhauled framework for Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) and ICOs. This decision was catalyzed by the association’s proactive engagement with Web3 firms, culminating in a series of discussions to pinpoint the most effective guidelines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moneygram, a leading money transfer company, announced plans to launch its own non-custodial digital wallet in partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation. The wallet will enable users to convert between fiat and digital currencies when sending cross-border payments.
 
Moneygram Partners With Stellar to Launch Non-Custodial Digital Wallet
 
Set to launch in the first quarter of 2024, the new digital wallet will allow Moneygram customers to cash out their digital assets at any participating Moneygram location worldwide. Additionally, the wallet will let users send digital assets to other wallet users. However, privacy advocates might take issue with the fact that Moneygram will apply its compliance screening to all wallet users.
 
“Our vision to connect the world’s communities by empowering our customers through innovative financial solutions takes another step forward today,” said Alex Holmes, CEO of Moneygram. Holmes added, “The Moneygram non-custodial digital wallet advances this mission even further.”
 
Offered without fees until June 2024, the non-custodial wallet will use Stellar’s blockchain network and integrate with Moneygram’s existing fiat on- and off-ramps. Moneygram plans to expand the wallet’s capabilities after its launch, introducing new features that further connect global money transfers with blockchain payments.
 
 
Building on Moneygram’s 2022 ventures in the crypto space, the company launched a USDC crypto-to-cash program last June, allowing users to cash out digital currencies. In November, Moneygram began permitting customers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly within its money transfer app. The non-custodial wallet represents the company’s most recent effort to increase access to digital assets.

Microstrategy’s Purchase Behind Recent Positive Coinbase Premium?
 
Yesterday, Michael Saylor’s Microstrategy announced that it has acquired an additional 5,445 BTC at a cost of $147.3 million. In a post on X, Maartunn, the CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager, has shared some key charts related to the company’s shopping spree.

The  
Evolution of Bitcoin: From Digital Gold to Digital Cash
Satoshi  
Nakamoto, the enigmatic developer of Bitcoin, envisioned it as a peer-to-peer

the region's trading volumes. Its derivatives transactions constitute nearly  
75% of the worldwide crypto trading volume, which witnessed a robust growth of

U.S. Treasury Targets Sinaloa Cartel Member’s Ether Wallet in Crackdown on Fentanyl Distribution
 
OFAC said Tuesday it sanctioned ten individuals, including several Sinaloa Cartel affiliates and fugitives, for contributing to the international proliferation of illicit drugs. In addition to sanctioning people, OFAC designated the Ethereum wallet with the address “0x9c2” used by Jimenez Castro.
 
“Jimenez Castro has directed U.S.-based couriers to pick up cash in the United States and deposit it into various virtual currency wallets for payment directly to the Chapitos and for reinvestment in fentanyl production,” OFAC said.
 
The Sinaloa Cartel is considered one of the most powerful drug trafficking groups in Mexico and is a major supplier of fentanyl in the U.S. OFAC said the sanctions target members of Los Chapitos, a faction run by the sons of imprisoned Sinaloa leader Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.
 
 
OFAC said the sanctions demonstrate “the [Biden] Administration’s strengthened approach to saving lives by disrupting the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and its precursors into American communities.”
 
The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets held by the Ethereum wallet and prohibit Americans from conducting transactions with the wallet. OFAC said it will continue targeting foreign drug traffickers contributing to the opioid epidemic through sanctions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s U.K. division, Chase UK, is putting the brakes on cryptocurrency-related payments. Come October 16, any Chase UK customers attempting to make a bank transfer or card payment linked to crypto will find themselves thwarted.
 
Chase UK to Halt Crypto Payments in Mid-October
 
Chase UK customers are about to hit a roadblock for payments tied to cryptocurrency dealings. The bank’s rationale? A spike in scams and fraud. An email from the institution cautions, “If we think you’re making a payment related to crypto assets, we’ll decline it.”
 
A representative from Chase verified the email’s legitimacy to Bloomberg and shed light on their stance. Coindesk’s Sandali Handagama also reported on the Chase UK email on Tuesday prior to Bloomberg’s confirmation.
 
“We’ve seen an increase in the number of crypto scams targeting U.K. consumers, so we have taken the decision to prevent the purchase of crypto assets on a Chase debit card or by transferring money to a crypto site from a Chase account,” the Chase spokesperson revealed.
 
 
Chase made its move after a series of regulatory overhauls in the United Kingdom within the past six months. For instance, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new guidelines for the crypto industry. Concurrently, the financial powerhouse Paypal has briefly suspended U.K.-based crypto transactions, pointing to these regulatory adjustments.
