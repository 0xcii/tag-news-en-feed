        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin was trading under $17,000 to start the week, as markets prepared for a big week of economic announcements. U.S. inflation figures will be released tomorrow, and are expected to fall to 7.3%. Many believe this will give way to the Federal Reserve pivoting from its aggressive rate hike policy. Ethereum was also lower, and is trading below $1,250 as of writing.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the week in the red, as traders prepared for a big week of economic announcements from the United States.
 
Inflation figures will be released on Tuesday, and are expected to fall to 7.3%, down from 7.7% the month prior.
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $16,899.39 during Monday’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $17,245.64.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, today’s decline saw bitcoin move lower for a fourth straight day, edging closer to a floor of $16,700 in the process.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is currently tracking at 47.42, is also nearing a resistance of its own at 46.00.
 
Depending on tomorrow’s inflation figure we could see BTC move below $16,700, and potentially towards the $16,000 mark.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also trended downwards on Monday, with prices falling for a second consecutive session.
 
Following a high of $1,281.78 on Sunday, ETH/USD moved to a bottom of $1,243.48 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw ethereum fall to its lowest point since November 8, and it is now nearing a floor of $1,230.
 
 
Looking at the chart, recent bearish sentiment in ETH returned once the RSI failed to break out of a ceiling of 52.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 48.60, and now seems to be moving towards a floor of 45.30.
 
Despite this downtrend, the 10-day (red) moving average still remains above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.

After FTX’s bankruptcy, almost all major crypto exchanges have started to provide a supposed proof that they are not speculating with their customers’ funds and hold them in full.
 
Since there is no industry-wide standard for Proof of Reserves (PoR) yet, the community is looking particularly critically at the exchanges’ approach. And Changpeng Zhao’s Binance and its latest PoR are, of course, at the top of the list.
 
The Wall Street Journal recently published a report that comes down hard on Binance. The exchange hired an outside accounting firm to prepare a “proof-of-reserve report” covering some of its assets and liabilities.

Bitcoin app CoinCorner said in a statement Monday that it had enabled Send Globally, a feature that lets foreign users instantly and cheaply send remittances to Africa, for its EU and U.K. customers.
The feat is made possible through a partnership with Africa-based Bitcoin app Bitnob, and comes on the heels of a similar team-up with Lightning payments app Strike.
Strike last week enabled Send Globally for its U.S. users, letting them instantly transfer money to bank accounts in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya with minimal fees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has made an explosive claim about the legal dispute between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in one of his infamous Ask Me Anything (AMA) videos.
 
Hoskinson commented on a possible settlement date for the case between Ripple and the SEC.
 
The Cardano leader has reportedly received information that a settlement between the two parties could be made public on Dec. 15.

The blackouts also affect telecommunications, leaving some of these operations that rely on off-grid power plants without the internet needed to complete mining tasks.
Cryptocurrency Mining in Cuba Not Feasible Under Current Conditions
Cryptocurrency has reached a notable level of functionality in Cuba, as citizens use it as an alternative to getting services that they would be unable to get otherwise, including international shopping, mobile and internet top-up services, and even sending and receiving remittances.
