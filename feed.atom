        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/estonias-licensed-crypto-firms-drop-80-as-under-new-amtcft-regime/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-08T18:04:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Enforcement of last year’s amendment  
to Estonia’s anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financial of  
terrorism (CFT) regulation has  
resulted in a dramatic drop in the number of licensed cryptocurrency service  
providers. As of May 1, 2023, there were only 100 crypto firms with operating  
licenses, which  
is an 80% drop from 489 as of March 15, 2022, when the amended Money  
Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act came into force.
According to the Estonia  
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a total of 389 operating licenses have been withdrawn  
either voluntarily or based on its action. Of this number, nearly 200 were  
withdrawn by the companies while about the same number were revoked by the  
financial transactions watchdog. 
Estonia, a country in Northern  
Europe, is considered one of the most crypto-friendly countries in the  
continent alongside Switzerland, Denmark,  
Germany and Slovenia. As of summer of 2021, when Matis  
Mäeker, FIU’s new head, came into  
office, about 650 crypto services licenses were valid in the Baltic nation, the  
regulator said in a  
statement released on Monday.
Watchdog Finds 'A Lot of Suspicious  
Circumstances'
However, following tougher  
checks in line with the amended regulation, FIU said it found “a lot of suspicious  
circumstances” in crypto firm’s license applications. 
“This calls into question the  
credibility of the businesses that wanted to come here and their actual desire  
to provide services in Estonia,” said Mäeker. “It also shows the desire of some  
individuals to use the Estonian economic system and financial system for  
illegal activities.”

Bitcoin Price Consolidates Below Resistance
 
Bitcoin price is currently trading at just below $28,000. Despite a lack of continued momentum at resistance, there has also been a distinct lack of a rejection.
 
In a market as volatile as crypto, prices rarely linger in a tight range very long. And when they do, the release in volatility is always worth the wait.

The Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Liechtenstein, Daniel Risch, announced the news in an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt on Sunday. This bold move comes as many countries around the world are still grappling with how to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies.
 
Liechtenstein Embraces Bitcoin
 
In the interview, Risch revealed that the country plans to accept Bitcoin deposits and exchange them immediately for Swiss francs, Liechtenstein’s national currency. While he did not give a specific timeline for the implementation of the new payment option, Risch expressed support for this movement.

Bitcoin Taproot Utilization Has Crossed The 43% Mark Recently
 
As pointed out by Rafael Schultze-Kraft, the co-founder of the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, Taproot is currently being used in more BTC transactions than ever before. “Taproot” refers to a Bitcoin upgrade that went live in November 2021 and introduced some changes to make transfers more efficient and faster.
 
The upgrade initially saw little usage, but in the last few months, it has been coming in use a lot more. There are two different metrics available that aim to track the progress of Taproot being accepted: the “adoption” and the “utilization.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp plunged to a six-week low on Monday, as cryptocurrency markets moved further into the red. The global crypto market cap fell by over 3% to start the week, which comes days ahead of the upcoming U.S. inflation report. Solana also declined, hitting a multi-week low.
 
XRP
 
Xrp, formerly known as ripple, fell by as much as 5% on Monday, with the global market cap slipping by over 3% in the day.
 
XRP/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.4333 to start the week, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $0.4606.
 
As a result of this decline, XRP moved to its lowest point since March 25, breaking out of a floor at $0.4360 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the slippage came as the relative strength index (RSI), broke out of a floor at 39.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 36.04, with XRP at a level of $0.4365.
 
Overall, the token is down 5.11% as of writing.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) remained in the red, as the token extended its own recent declines to a third session.
 
Following a high of $22.74 on Sunday, SOL/USD fell to a low of $21.01 earlier in the day.
 
Monday’s drop in price has sent SOL to its long-term support point at $21.00, resulting in its lowest level since April 26.
 
 
The token has rebounded from earlier lows, as the RSI found a floor of its own at the 44.00 mark.
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 44.57, with a ceiling at 49.00 a potential target for bulls.
 
If momentum does rise, and more bulls reenter the market, that could lead to SOL climbing back above $22.00.

However, BTC maxis have now come forward to allay these fears and assure the community that Bitcoin is not under attack. Some have pointed out that high demand may have spiked BTC transaction fees. 
 
BTC Maxis Calms Fear Of Bitcoin DoS Attack
 
A DoS attack is a type of cyber-attack that disrupts the normal functioning of a website or network. In the case of BTC, this could cause the network to slow down or even crash, making it difficult for users to transact. However, BTC maxis have emphasized that the network is designed to withstand such attacks.

Ethereum Exchange Deposits Have Spiked Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst on Twitter, there are signs of increased short-term selling pressure in the ETH market at the moment. The relevant indicator here is the “Ethereum active deposits,” which measures the daily total number of exchange addresses that are taking part in some deposit activity currently.
 
This indicator only keeps track of the unique number of such addresses, meaning that it only counts an address once even if it has been involved in multiple deposit transactions in a single day.

        <updated>2023-05-08T14:46:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin transaction fees have surged significantly in the past 24 hours, with the average fee reaching $19.20 per transfer. The increase in fees can be linked to a backlog of transactions trapped in the mempool, as over 440,000 unconfirmed transactions are currently awaiting confirmation.
 
Block Reward Dethroned: Bitcoin Transaction Fees Surpass Mining Subsidy for the First Time Since 2017
 
On Sunday, May 7, 2023, bitcoin transaction fees exceeded the block reward for the first time since December 2017 at block height 788,695. Subsequent block heights 788,700 and 788,702 also witnessed fees surpassing the subsidy.
 
At present, over 440,000 bitcoin transactions are pending confirmation with 193 blocks left to mine for clearing them all. Fees soared past the $25 mark per transaction on Sunday, and current data displays an average fee of 0.00069 BTC or $19.20 per transaction.
 
According to bitinfocharts.com data, the median-sized fee is 0.0004 BTC or $11.05 per transfer. High-priority transactions are paying upwards of $22.90 per transaction and individuals are paying $19.95 for medium-priority transactions.
 
Block intervals or mining times have been exceeding the ten-minute average lately. The most recent block time was approximately ten minutes and 34 seconds. Slower block times may result in another decline in difficulty — an estimated drop of around 5.3% is anticipated to occur on May 18, 2023.
 
 
The average hashrate over the past 2,016 blocks is roughly 338 exahash per second (EH/s). The network’s hashrate has dipped below the 300 EH/s range on some instances and is presently running at 385 EH/s at the time of writing.

Notably, the hype and frenzy about meme coins spiked due to the impressive performance of Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Wojak (WOJAK). The influx of these projects has congested the BTC network. As a result, BTC’s transaction fees surged to a multi-year peak.  
 
BRC-20 Tokens Fees Hit Multi-Year High
 
With the growing hype around meme coins, the activities surrounding the tokens within the Bitcoin network keep rising. According to the crypto data analytics platform Dune Analytics, the daily minting fees on BRC-20 hit a record high of 247 BTC on May 7.

Argentina is currently in the midst of a crippling inflation crisis, with the national currency, the Argentine peso (ARS), losing value at an alarming rate. Just one year ago, the exchange rate from the U.S. dollar to the ARS was 115.75, and at the time of this writing, it stands at 224.52. Reports indicate that on the black market, people are paying more than double this rate. The country's annual inflation rate has skyrocketed to a staggering 104%, presenting significant challenges to both its economy and citizens.

Bitcoin (BTC) moved lower to start the week, as cryptocurrency markets continued to react to the latest nonfarm payrolls report.
 
The number of jobs added to the U.S. economy came in higher than expected, in many’s eyes justifying the Federal Reserve’s decision to hike interest rates by 0.25%.
 
As a result, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $27,691.26 earlier in today’s session, following a peak of $29,119.38 the day prior.

Overall, BTC has now fallen for a third straight session, with this latest drop sending prices to a one-week low.
 
One of the catalysts for the decline was a breakout which took place on the relative strength index (RSI), which fell below a floor at 47.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.32, with a floor of 42.00 a potential target for bears.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also in the red on Monday, with prices plunging below $1,900.
 
Following a high of $1,934.00 on Sunday, ETH/USD dropped by almost $100, hitting a low of $1,839.89 earlier in the day.
 
Similar to bitcoin, today’s decline saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency fall for its third consecutive day.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that ethereum bears are now attempting to take the RSI to its own point of support at 45.00.
 
Currently, the index is at the 47.02 level, having recently moved below a higher support point at 49.00.
 
Should price strength hit the target of 45.00, there is a possibility that ETH will be trading under $1,800.
