        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many countries have been on the quest to launch CBDCs. According to data from Crowdsourcingweek, up to 105 countries have shown interest in these central bank digital currencies.
 
Out of these countries, the Bahamas, Nigeria, the Caribbeans, China, and Jamaica have launched CBDCs. In addition, other countries, such as Ghana, South Africa, UAE, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, etc., have launched theirs on a pilot basis.
 
But amid the interest following these CBDCs, the former Bank of England advisor, Tony Yates, states that the project is not worth it. According to Yates, the risks and costs of rolling out digital currencies are way higher than their benefits. The advisor shared his take in an opinion piece by Financial Times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price has risen by more than 28% since January 1, posting an impressive rally to start the year. The price movement has been driven by the global financial market’s expectation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to slow its pace of interest rate hikes before the pivot comes later this year.
 
According to Bitcoin on-chain analysis pioneer Willy Woo, this has resulted in the market now being in the “disbelief” phase of the cycle. Woo refers to the chart below, which is usually used to describe market cycles in all financial markets, and said: “I suspect we are in the “disbelief” phase of the cycle.”
 
Woo claims that BTC has already passed through the panic, anger, and depression phases, and is thus at the end of the cycle, and about to enter a new market cycle.

Authorities Cracking Down on Cryptocurrency Scams
 
Europol announced Thursday that authorities from Bulgaria, Serbia, Cyprus, and Germany, in collaboration with Europol and Eurojust, have taken down “call centers selling fake crypto.”
 
The criminal network, operating through call centers, “lured victims into investing large amounts of money into fake cryptocurrency schemes,” Europol explained, elaborating:
 

The suspects used advertisements on social networks to lure victims to websites covertly operated by the criminals, which offered seemingly exceptional investment opportunities in cryptocurrencies.
 
Fifteen people have been arrested in the case while 261 were questioned and 22 locations were searched, including four call centers. The authorities also seized three hardware wallets containing about $1 million in cryptocurrencies, approximately 50,000 euros in cash, three vehicles, electronic equipment, documents, and data backups.
 
Victims, primarily from Germany, were initially convinced to invest small sums of money. “Fake price hikes leading to supposedly lucrative profits for investors then persuaded them to make transfers of higher amounts,” the EU law enforcement agency noted, adding:
 

Currently, it is estimated that the financial damage to German victims is over two million euro.
 
Europol further revealed that there are also victims in other countries, including Switzerland, Australia, and Canada.
