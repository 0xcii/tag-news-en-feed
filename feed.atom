US SEC’s Appeal Move Receives Backlash From Stuart Alderoty
 
The prolonged legal tussle between the US SEC and Ripple over XRP saw a notable turn of events on Wednesday as the regulatory body filed for an appeal toward the court’s previous ruling that XRP does not constitute a security nature under the requirements of the current legislation.
 
 
It is worth noting that the agency’s move to file a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals comes less than 2 months after Judge Analisa Torres gave her final decision in the len…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AT&T is back in the news again for new legal challenges related to a sensational SIM swap case in which crypto worth $24 million was stolen from an investor by the name of Michael Terpin.
 
Recently, a division of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a recent ruling by the lower court in favor of the telecom company and thereby allowed the case to continue in trial.
 
This ruling also brings back on track Terpin’s lawsuit against the telecom company, and consequently, underlines important issues involving the different roles of telcos in protecting customer information.
