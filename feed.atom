Morgan, known for his bullish stance on XRP, recently voiced a bullish sentiment on how the cryptocurrency can reach its current all-time high of $3.4 despite the lingering lawsuit with the SEC.
 
 
Despite its partial victory against the SEC last year, Ripple’s case against the regulator has dragged on in court and investors are now divided into two schools of thought regarding XRP’s price trajectory. According to Morgan, who recently tagged XRP’s current lackluster performance as unnatural, the crypto can create a new all-time high this year.

Bitcoin And The Energy Dilemma
 
The conversation ignited when Ackman responded directly to a user’s post, highlighting the significant energy consumption resulting from the recent surge in BTC prices.
 
In his unconventional scenario, he suggests a chain reaction: the rally in Bitcoin prices leads to increased mining, subsequently driving up energy costs.
