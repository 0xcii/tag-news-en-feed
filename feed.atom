        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission recently approved Bitcoin Spot ETFs for several major asset managers, paving the way for the city to become a leading hub for such products. 
The approval comes after months of anticipation and marks a significant milestone for the Bitcoin industry in Asia.

JUST IN: 🇭🇰 Hong Kong spot #Bitcoin ETFs will begin trading on April 30: HashKey Capital
Asia is ready 🚀 pic.twitter.com/TDfNZTqPQU
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 24, 2024
 
 
 
HashKey Capital, a local asset management firm, confirmed that its Bitcoin ETF will start trading next Tuesday. In a statement, a spokesman for the firm acknowledged the launch date, making it one of the first companies to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong.
OSL, a digital asset platform that acts as a sub-custodian and infrastructure service provider for two major fund managers, has also indicated that spot bitcoin products aim to launch as early as late April. This news further solidifies Hong Kong's position as a frontrunner in the race to offer investors access to Bitcoin through traditional financial instruments.
Elsewhere, some of China's top asset managers are in the final leg of preparations for the spot Bitcoin ETFs to begin trading potentially by the end of April. 
This development is expected to attract significant interest from investors within and outside Hong Kong.

According to predictions by Singapore-based crypto services provider Matrixport and Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, Hong Kong Spot Bitcoin ETFs could bring in and unlock up to $25 billion in new demand. 
This influx of capital could have a profound impact on Bitcoin and further legitimize it as an asset class.]]></summary>

A “Message” To The Binance Founder And The World
 
Zhao’s explicit disregard for US regulations was underscored by the DOJ in a scathing sentencing memorandum. They quoted Zhao’s own words, highlighting his approach to legal compliance: “Better to ask for forgiveness than permission,” suggesting a strategic bypass of regulatory requirements to expedite Binance’s market expansion and profitability.

The extension of Gambaryan’s remand was granted by the Nigerian court yesterday (Tuesday) amid opposition from federal prosecutors to the appeal for bail. The crypto exchange’s executive has already pleaded not guilty to charges of tax evasion and money laundering.
Gambaryan holds the position of Head of Financial Crime Compliance at the crypto exchange. He and another fellow Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, who holds the position of its African Regional Manager, traveled to Nigeria in an official capacity earlier this year but were detained by local authorities.

A recent analysis by CryptoQuant, a blockchain analytics firm, paints a picture of a changing investor landscape, with a new breed of “whales” – high-volume crypto holders – entering the fray and established players holding their ground.
 
 
This influx of fresh capital is significant. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju reports that these “new whales,” likely hailing from traditional finance and entering through Bitcoin ETFs, have amassed a staggering $111 billion worth of Bitcoin. This edges the holdings of established, “long-term whales” whose collective stash sits at $67 billion.
