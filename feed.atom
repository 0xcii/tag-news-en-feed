7-Day Average Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Shot Up Recently
 
The “Mining Hashrate” refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that the miners as a whole have connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. The miners need this computing power because the BTC network uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) based consensus mechanism, where validators compete against each other to solve mathematical problems to add the next block to the chain.
 
 
As such, the Hashrate can reflect how the miners are looking at the cryptocurrency. A rise in the metric could suggest these validators are finding the asset attractive right now, so new miners are coming and/…]]></summary>

US judge allowed a class action lawsuit from shareholders to move forward. The

Heightened Scrutiny
This ruling comes as Coinbase faces heightened  
scrutiny from regulators. A group of Coinbase shareholders claims the company  
made "materially false and misleading statements" regarding its  
chances of facing legal action from the SEC. 
According to the court filings, the plaintiffs, who

Not only that, the county also began buying BTC to add to its reserves, growing that stash over the years. Now that the country is three years into its BTC bet, let’s take a look at how it’s going so far and if this investment was a wise decision in the long run.
 
El Salvador’s Bitcoin Holdings
 
The very first Bitcoin purchase by El Salvador, according to President Nayib Bukele, was made on September 6, 2021, one day before the announcement of the adoption of BTC as a legal tender. At the time, the country bought 400 BTC at an average price of $46,811, costing $18.724 million at the time.
