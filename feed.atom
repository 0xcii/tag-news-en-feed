With the rise in the crypto market over the last day, the analyst’s prediction of a surge has come to pass. Now, in an update, Santana reveals what is next for the beloved altcoin.
 
Predicting The XRP Price Rally
 
Santana first took to TradingView to share his analysis of the XRP price performance on October 13. This initial post had been made when the price of the digital asset was still trading at just $0.48, and way before the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its lawsuit against Ripple’s co-founders.

Real Volume Amid XRP Price Rally
 
In the real volume chart by Messari, an interesting pattern can be seen with the XRP price rally. For one, the real volume shows how trading volume has spiked at various price points. The most notable of these is what happens when there is an XRP price spike.
 
 
Volume tends to jump at these points suggesting that there is a high degree of interest in the altcoin. This means that as XRP tokens go on the market, there are eager investors waiting to pick up on this available supply and defend the price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin price just set a higher high above the current 2023 high and 52-week high.
 
What’s next after this as Bitcoin bulls continue to march upward?
 
Bitcoin Price Sets New 52-Week High
 
Bitcoin price is now trading above $31,800, which was the most recent 2023 high set back in July. Not only did July hold the record for the highest price in all of 2023, but it was the standing 52-week high — another important measure of an asset’s success.
 
 
A 52-week high represents one full year of trading, which is a slightly different metric than the 2023 high.
 

 
 
ETF Rumors Cause A Frenzy Of Buying
 
The sustained buying is being driven by rumors circulating that BlackRock’s spot ETF could be approved any day. 
 
 
– Rumors of SEC communicating with potential Bitcoin ETF issuers 
– Issuers update filings 
– BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation 
– Judge orders SEC to revisit Grayscale’s spot ETF filing
 
The signs are all there, it’s coming.
 
— Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) October 23, 2023
 
 
The ETF being listed by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation caused additional speculation this afternoon, propelling prices powerfully higher.  
 
High Times: What’s Next For BTCUSD? 
 
If Bitcoin can continue its rally, the next major points of resistance are locally at $36,000 per coin and higher at between $42,000 and $48,000. 
 
 
Beyond those levels, BTCUSD would be potentially revisiting all-time highs above $60,000 per coin.  Will this buying activity keep up and turn into an impulse that takes BTC to new all-time highs?]]></summary>

Bitcoin price is back above $31,000 after spending more than a year in the $20,000 range. A higher high above the current 2023 record – which is less than $1,000 away at this point – could send the top cryptocurrency into overdrive.
 
If price action marches higher from here, there’s a strong chance that BTCUSD has entered what’s called an impulse phase. An impulse phase is the most bullish (or bearish) point of any trend, just before things begin to accelerate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the onchain analyst Zachxbt, 4,800 bitcoins taken from the now-defunct darknet marketplace Abraxas were transferred to a bitcoin mixing service. Abraxas exit scammed in November 2015 after less than a year, and the bitcoins had remained untouched since then.
 
$144M in Bitcoin from 2015 Abraxas Scandal Suddenly Moved to Mixer
 
Zachxbt reported on the social media site X (formerly Twitter) that the 4,800 bitcoins, valued at $144 million, from an Abraxas wallet were moved to a mixing service.
 
“An entity moved ~4800 BTC ($144M) originating from Abraxas darknet market which exit scammed in Nov 2015 after previously sitting dormant,” the analyst said on Monday. “They consolidated funds and also deposited [them into] a bitcoin mixer,” Zachxbt added.
 
 
When Abraxas defrauded its customers and vendors, bitcoin was trading at $386 per unit on the day the marketplace disappeared. This means the stolen bitcoins from Abraxas were worth about $1.85 million at that time.
 
Abraxas began its operations roughly at the same time as the notorious darknet marketplaces Alphabay and Agora, launching on Dec. 13, 2014. Data from gwern.net shows that the site became inaccessible on Nov. 5, 2015, and the bitcoin wallets were emptied in March 2016.
 
 
Following Abraxas’ exit scam, vendors and marketplace users frantically looked for new darknet marketplaces. In the process, several of these new platforms also defrauded their users. Research indicates that Agora also shut down around that period, leading both Agora and Abraxas users to migrate to Alphabay.
 
Subsequently, Alphabay rapidly became the leading DNM until law enforcement seized it in July 2017. The reason for the recent movement of the Abraxas bitcoin stash remains unknown, except for the fact that the funds are now worth $142 million more than they were in 2015.
