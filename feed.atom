        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the end of the prolonged XRP lawsuit case with the United States (US) Securities Exchange and Commission (SEC) is still very much uncertain, on April 9, a partner at the law firm of Hogan & Hogan and a lawyer took to his Twitter with a series of tweets to oppose the SEC claims on Ripple.
 
Initiating a lawsuit, this claim on the Ripple company which owns XRP involved that the company has been selling the XRP tokens as “unregulated security.” However, according to the lawyer Jeremy Hogan, XRP is nothing close to “security.”2

On that note, Bitget, a Seychelles-based crypto derivatives exchange, has launched a Web3 development-focused fund for crypto startups in Asia. According to the announcement, the fund will kick off with an initial investment of $100 million.
 
While the funding will prioritize Asian projects with clear roadmaps and experienced teams, Bitget plans to seek out venture capitalists and web3-friendly startups globally.

Although leading Bitcoin researchers were quick to refute the information and data as biased and false, the article remains online in an effort to push BTC into the corner of a climate sinner.
 
One of the leading Bitcoin environmentalists and researchers, Daniel Batten, has picked apart the New York Times piece and data to the core, revealing that the article lacks any journalistic integrity. As Batten discussed at length on Twitter, the mainstream publication only cherry-picked the data that fit its “Bitcoin is bad” leitmotif.

The move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency briefly break out of a key resistance level of $28,500. Ethereum was also higher, as it closed in on the $1,900 level.

BTC/USD rose to a high of $28,532.83 earlier in today’s session, after trading at a low of $27,828.48 the day before.
 
As a result of the move, BTC/USD marginally moved past a ceiling at $28,500, however momentum has since shifted.

Initially, today’s rally came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a recent floor at 58.00
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 61.07, with the next visible point of resistance at the 65.00 mark.
 
BTC is trading at $28,327.63 at the time of writing.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) was also higher on Monday, with prices closing in on the $1,900 level.
 
Following a low of $1,828.78 on Sunday, ETH/USD climbed to a peak of $1,873.06 to start the week.

Earlier gains have since eased, which comes as a result of the RSI nearing a key resistance point of 62.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is at a reading of 58.83, with the index closing in on a ceiling at 62.00.
 
Should ETH move beyond this point, it is likely that prices will surge above $1,900.
