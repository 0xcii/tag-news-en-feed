 The most recent coup in Niger brings to a head a lot of the challenges that have been happening in west Africa, in Francophone Africa in particular. The French and US involvement in this region was purportedly to help economic development and fight corruption within Western Africa. As the Niger Coup edges towards a hot war, in the West we should consider what our role is in the region and whether we are justified in getting involved militarily. Could Bitcoin do what decades of American and French involvement have failed to do?
 Many point to France’s involvement in the CFA (African Financial Community) as a method of controlling their former colonies through their control of the exchange rate. They have been able to devalue the CFA franc against the French Franc, or now the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XRP extended a recent bull run on Friday, as the token moved to its highest point in the past two weeks. Today’s move came as the cryptocurrency marginally broke past a key resistance level. Solana was also in the green, as price rose for a fourth straight day, nearing the $20.00 mark in the process.
 
XRP
 
XRP was a notable gainer on Friday, as the cryptocurrency climbed higher for a fourth straight session.
 
XRP/USD peaked at a high of $0.5051 earlier in the day, which comes a day after trading at a low of $0.4824.
 
As a result of today’s gains, XRP, formerly ripple, rose to its highest point since September 1, when price traded at a high of $0.5115.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move occurred after the token broke out of a resistance level at $0.4920.
 
This took place as the relative strength index (RSI) briefly escaped a ceiling of its own around the 38.00 mark.
 
Price strength now sits at 38.42, with the next visible point of resistance at 42.00.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) maintained a bull run of its own today, as it too rose higher for a fourth consecutive day.
 
Following a low of $18.77 on Thursday, SOL/USD edged to a high of $19.26 earlier in today’s session.
 
The rally saw solana once again break out of a ceiling at $19.20, however like yesterday bulls were unable to maintain this move.
 
 
At the time of writing, SOL has since edged lower, and is now trading at $18.95, with the RSI hovering near a hurdle of its own.
 
The index is now tracking at 41.98, which is just below the aforementioned resistance level of 42.00.
 
In order to push towards $20.00, solana bulls need to force a breakout in the coming days.
