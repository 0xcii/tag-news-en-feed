Argentine President Javier Milei Launches Massive Deregulation Measures

Taking to X on December 22, the CEO of Lumida Wealth, Ram Ahluwalia, has offered a theory on why ETH prices are likely to recover and reverse losses, possibly outperforming the world’s most liquid coin, Bitcoin (BTC).
 
ETHE Discount Rapidly Closing
 
To illustrate, the CEO pointed to the ETHE chart, whose discount has been steadily closing over the past few trading months. Ahluwalia observed a 4% gain on December 22, further reducing the discount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roughly three weeks ago, Bitcoin.com News covered the stablecoin GHO, when it achieved a notable milestone by reaching $0.98 per coin. However, on December 11, the token experienced a slight dip, hitting $0.975 per unit. Despite some improvement in its stability, the stablecoin has still not enforced its intended goal of a $1 peg.
 
GHO’s Struggle for Stability
 
Launched by Avara (formerly known as Aave), GHO has been a noteworthy example in the realm of dollar-pegged tokens. Since its inception in mid-July, the digital currency has consistently failed to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar, persistently falling short of this mark. Despite a low point of $0.917 on October 24, 2023, GHO saw an upswing towards the end of November, reaching $0.98 per coin.
