Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett highlighted Deaton’s potential involvement on X, stating, “Is US Senate candidate John Deaton planning to get involved in the Coinbase case?

As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment in a post on X, the large BTC holders in the market haven’t been shaken by the recent downturn in the price.
 
The indicator of interest here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total amount of Bitcoin that the various wallet groups in the sector are holding right now.

approximately 7,142 Bitcoins will exit exchange reserves daily. 
Bitcoin Supply Hits Unprecedented Scarcity
The much-anticipated halving event, which reduces the  
supply of Bitcoins by 50%, is expected to make the digital asset more scarce. Bybit  
highlighted the rapid reduction  of Bitcoin reserves across centralized

Amidst this turbulence, prominent Bitcoin advocate and investor, Samson Mow, has emerged as a beacon of optimism for Bitcoin enthusiasts.
