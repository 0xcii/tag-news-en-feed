        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uncle Sam made off with more than $215 million this month as it began to liquidate portions of seized bitcoin.
The United States government has been selling bitcoin confiscated from the Silk Road case in 2013. 
According to a court filing, the government sold 9,861.1707894 Bitcoin on March 14, 2023, for a total of $215,738,154.98. After transaction fees, the net proceeds for the government were $215,522,416.83. The government also revealed that there are still around 41,490.72 bitcoin left to be sold, which they plan to sell in four more batches over the course of this year.
Previously, the government has auctioned bitcoin, opting instead to proceed with open market sales this time.
The Silk Road was a darknet marketplace that was used to sell drugs, amongst other services. Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road, was convicted in 2015 and sentenced to life in prison. Ulbricht now seeks clemency, as a double life sentence without parole for entirely non-violent charges illustrates the government’s desire to make an example of those who build platforms outside their jurisdiction. 
Bitcoin Magazine recently opened an art gallery in Nashville, Tennessee, which currently houses a life-size jail cell Ross Ulbricht exhibit, including art that Ulbricht made in prison, as well as writing from ulbricht. 
Bitcoin’s price action as of late has been exciting for those who watched it fall from all-time highs of $69,000, to local lows of less than $16,000. While the government has been selling bitcoin, other institutions like MicroStrategy have been acquiring it.]]></summary>

The answer to the CBDC “total nightmare of monetary control,” as Corbett puts it, is cash, creativity, and to “choose to inform ourselves about agorism and the countereconomy.”

The suspension was due to an ongoing investigation by the Commodity Futures Commission (CFTC) into potential violations committed by the exchange.
 
 
The decision to halt services came amidst the current global banking crisis, which has caused uncertainty and affected Binance.US’s operations.
 
The suspended services include BUSD crypto deposits and withdrawals and buying, selling, and converting crypto options.
 
The exchange has confirmed on its status dashboard that it is investigating the situation, and the services will remain suspended until further notice. Additionally, the exchange recently…]]></summary>

Boerse Stuttgart Digital, a subsidiary of the second largest stock exchange in Germany, has received the final license as a cryptocurrency custodian from Germany's financial regulator, BaFin. The license allows the exchange to provide institutional investors the ability to trade bitcoin on the platform as well as to act as a custodian. 
The exchange has been offering custody services through its Blocknox platform since January 2020, under a provisional license. With this new licensing, it will join the ranks of several major international firms officially entering into the bitcoin custodial and trading industry as of late. 
Fidelity opened their bitcoin trading platform to the public this month, allowing institutional investors the option to hold their bitcoin with them as well. In addition to that, Latin America’s largest e-commerce platform by market value, Mercado Libre, introduced bitcoin trading to their Chilean users, which was already available in Brazil. 
It should be noted that all of these platforms bear the risks associated with third-party custody of your bitcoin. The safest way to ensure your bitcoin is always accessible and always available is through self-custody, using a dedicated bitcoin wallet. Platforms like Boerse Stuttgart Digital and Fidelity have made bitcoin trading available to investors on these platforms, but do not necessarily further enable the true potential of bitcoin adoption.]]></summary>

Hash Rate On The Move
The Bitcoin network hash rate is on the move this year, now at an all-time high of 350 EH/s and up 36.7% YTD.
