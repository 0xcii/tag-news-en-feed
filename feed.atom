        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The term “ultrasound money” has been thrown around quite a bit in the Ethereum (ETH) community, often describing the network’s potential to become a deflationary asset with better tokenomics than Bitcoin (BTC). While some proponents believe this narrative is well-founded, others argue it is overstated and based on overly optimistic assumptions.
 
Is The Ethereum “Ultrasound Money” Narrative Exaggerated?
 
In a post on X, antiprosynthesis.eth, a developer, challenged the “ultrasound money” narrative, arguing that it is often accompanied by jargon that may conceal the reality of Ethereum’s monetary policy. Specifically, the analyst believes the narrative is a bit “overboard” and loaded with “a bunch of pseudo-scientific hocus pocus” that might mislead ordinary users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has insisted that bitcoin doesn’t have value, emphasizing that its use cases are sex trafficking, tax avoidance, money laundering, and terrorism financing. However, JPMorgan has teamed up with Blackrock to help the world’s largest asset manager grow its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) as a lead authorized participant.
 
Jamie Dimon Insists Bitcoin Has No Value
 
The CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, still believes that bitcoin has no value even as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday. In an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday, Dimon expressed:
 

I’ve always said that bitcoin doesn’t have value … The actual use cases are sex trafficking, tax avoidance, money laundering, terrorism financing.
 
The JPMorgan executive’s comment echoed his statement made during a Senate Banking Committee’s hearing in December last year. In response to a question by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Dimon said: I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, etc. You pointed out the true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, anti-money laundering, tax avoidance.” He also said that he would close down crypto if he were the government.
 
 
Meanwhile, JPMorgan has teamed up with Blackrock as a lead authorized participant for the world’s largest asset manager’s spot bitcoin ETF, the Ishares Bitcoin Trust. JPMorgan is also named as an authorized participant for the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF.
 
Blackrock’s Ishares Bitcoin Trust was among the 11 spot bitcoin ETFs approved by the SEC on Wednesday. The fund will trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol IBIT. The NYSE Arca and the Cboe BZX Exchange will also list and trade some approved spot bitcoin ETFs.
 
When do you think JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon will change his mind and see the value of bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.]]></summary>

According to the report, these impending regulations are designed to mitigate the risks associated with trading in crypto assets.
 
One of their primary objectives is to facilitate Turkey’s removal from the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “grey list,” which identifies countries with insufficient measures against money laundering and terrorist financing. Simsek emphasized this in his statement, underlining the country’s effort to align with global financial security standards.

Over the last few years, El Salvador, one of the smallest countries in Central America, has been steadily growing its Bitcoin portfolio. Between September 2021 and January 2022, El Salvador’s government purchased about $85.5 million in Bitcoin. The country’s investment value saw a large decline after the price of Bitcoin began falling in November 2021. At the time, El Salvador lost about $22 million from the unexpected decline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved the listing of the first-ever spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This move marks a historic milestone in the evolution of Bitcoin adoption within traditional financial markets.
 
         
         
         
         
    
The approval comes after extensive deliberation and anticipation surrounding the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which are anticipated to offer investors direct exposure to the BTC.
The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States is expected to unlock unprecedented opportunities for both institutional and retail investors, offering a more accessible and regulated avenue for participating in the burgeoning Bitcoin market.
Industry analysts predict that the approval of these ETFs will catalyze a surge in institutional capital inflow into Bitcoin, potentially fueling BTC's value to new all time highs and solidifying its position as a legitimate asset class.
The exact launch date of the ETFs are expected tomorrow, Thursday January 11. Investors and Bitcoin enthusiasts alike are eagerly anticipating the ETFs' debut on major stock exchanges, anticipating their impact on market dynamics and investor sentiment.
The SEC's decision signifies a significant shift in regulatory stance towards embracing Bitcoin, signaling increased acceptance and recognition of it within the traditional financial realm. This approval is expected to pave the way for future developments in bitcoin-related investment products, potentially opening doors for a more diversified range of BTC-based financial instruments for investors.
As the SEC finalizes preparations for the listing of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, market participants are on the edge of their seats, awaiting a new era in the investment landscape shaped by the integration of bitcoin into mainstream portfolios.]]></summary>
