Recent reports reveal that Trump has made millions from his crypto investments, yet the heightened volatility in the crypto markets has taken a toll on his portfolio.
 
 
Trump’s Crypto Windfall
 
It all began when Trump’s name, image, and likeness were utilized in a non-fungible token (NFT) project called Trump Digital Trading Cards. These unique digital collectibles, priced at $99 each, swiftly gained traction and sold a staggering 45,000 units in December 2022.
 
Since then, Trump has been receiving royalties on trading volumes, accumulating over 1,800 Ethereum (ETH) and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) tokens, data from Arkham Intelligence shows.
