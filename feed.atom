        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the  
crypto market witnessed a surprising downturn after FTX unloaded a staggering  
$1 billion worth of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares. 
This unprecedented sell-off, primarily attributed to  
FTX's bankruptcy estate, now raises questions about the broader implications  
for the crypto landscape. According to a report by Coindesk, FTX is a significant  
contributor to the outflows amounting to more than $2 billion reported by the  
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).
Navigating Bitcoin ETF Space
CoinDesk's data review unveiled that FTX  
disposed of 22 million shares, accounting for nearly $1 billion of the overall  
outflow. Despite high expectations surrounding the approval of Bitcoin ETFs,

Ethereum
 
Ethereum’s (ETH) market capitalization stands at $287 billion, a reflection of its significant presence in the crypto market.

Bitcoin
 
Oscillators, key indicators of bitcoin’s momentum, and potential trend reversals present a mixed signal. The relative strength index (RSI) at 40 suggests a neutral to bearish stance, while the Stochastic at 12 and commodity channel index (CCI) at -120 also show a balancing act. However, the momentum indicator points to positivity at -2054, contrasting with the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) level at -484, which indicates a bearish outlook.
