        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon was one of the biggest movers in crypto markets on Tuesday, as the token fell by over 5% in today’s session. The decline saw the token fall to its weakest point in two months, breaking out of a key support point in the process. Cardano was also in the red today.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) dropped to a two-month low on Tuesday, as the token lost over 5% of its market value.
 
After peaking at $0.5679 to start the week, MATIC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.5351 earlier in the day.
 
The sell-off saw polygon plunge to its weakest point since June 10, when price neared a breakout below $0.5000.
 
 
Today’s move came as MATIC fell under a support point of $0.5600, with the relative strength index (RSI) also edging lower.
 
As of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 21.24, since slipping below a floor at the 24.00 level.
 
Should momentum remain bearish in the coming days, it is likely MATIC will fall under $0.5000.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
In addition to MATIC, cardano (ADA) was also in the red during today’s session, falling for a second straight day.
 
ADA/USD slipped to a bottom of $0.2582 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $0.2684.
 
The decline sees cardano move closer to a key support point of $0.2500, following last week’s breakout below this mark.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the RSI is also edging closer to a floor of its own at 30.00, and is currently tracking at 32.56.
 
In the event a move occurs below this mark, ADA bears will likely look to exit short positions at $0.2400.

Bitcoin is becoming increasingly relevant to everyday people as financial crises prompt discussion about how to improve our systems of finance, banking and government spending. Although the prevailing wisdom is that it’s better to get people to just use it and put off most of the learning until later, adoption will be more sustainable if people understand why Bitcoin is important, not just why it’s convenient.
Bitcoin Is Not Equivalent To Traditional Financial Services

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below the $26,000 level on Tuesday, as sentiment in the cryptocurrency market remained bearish. The latest drop comes despite price being oversold, following recent declines. As of writing, the global market cap is down 0.42%.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin dropped marginally below the $26,000 level during today’s session, as overall sentiment in the market remained bearish.
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $25,846.09 on Tuesday, following a high of $26,220.20 earlier in the day.
 
Price has since rebounded, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency currently trading at $26,088.64.
 
 
The decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) continued to hover close to a support point of 20.00.
 
At the time of writing, its exact reading is at 20.90, which is still deep in bear territory, with the next visible ceiling at 29.00.
 
Should bulls push price strength towards this point, BTC could end up near the $28,000 level.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) continued to hover near a support point of its own on Tuesday, as price consolidation continued.
 
Following a peak of $1,679.76 to start the week, ETH/USD slipped to an intraday bottom at the $1,651.96 mark.
 
Overall, ethereum has traded around a key price floor of $1,650 since last Thursday’s drop to a low of $1,540.
 
 
After falling below 20.00 over the weekend, the RSI has edged slightly higher in recent days, and is now tracking at 24.82.
 
A point of resistance at 27.00 is fast approaching, and should this point be broken, there is a good chance ETH will reenter the $1,700 zone.
 
Should the asset break out of this point, ETH will likely move back above $1,700.
