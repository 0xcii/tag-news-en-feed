At the current pace, Ethereum is torching around 1.75 million ETH annually, leading to a decrease in supply by approximately 0.98%. Technically, the platform is becoming slightly deflationary since the circulating supply of ETH is shrinking over time as the network actively burns coins.

Litecoin Mining Hashrate Is Close To Setting A New All-Time High
 
Like Bitcoin, Litecoin is a proof-of-work (PoW) network, meaning that chain validators called miners have to compete against each other using computing power to get a chance of hashing the next block.
 
The “mining hashrate” is an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of such computing power that miners have currently connected to the Litecoin network.
 
This computing power can be expensive, as aside from the initial cost of setting up the mining rigs, there is also the continuous running cost in the form of electricity bills.
 
Miners naturally pay these costs off using the reve…]]></summary>
