Bitcoin Has Been Seeing A Rise In “Paper BTC” Recently
 
In a new thread on X, analyst Willy Woo has talked about why BTC has seen bearish momentum recently despite the buying pressure from spot ETFs and institutional entities.
 
 
First, the analyst has explained a source of spot selling pressure: the long-term holders (LTHs). The LTHs refer to the HODLers of the market, who tend to keep their coins dormant for long periods.

According to Bloomberg, Nvidia is seeking to dismiss an investor suit claiming that the company was “deceptive” about its dependency on crypto mining revenue before a 2018 market downturn. 
 
The court’s ruling will determine whether the lawsuit lacks sufficient specificity. If the decision favors Nvidia, it could give companies greater leverage to dismiss shareholder suits early on, potentially avoiding costly litigation.

Although ETH holders and traders are upbeat, prices must decisively close above this liquidation level, paving the way for more gains in short to medium term.
