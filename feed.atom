In August, globally, a record number of women bet on the FIFA Women’s World Cup in soccer, the most-viewed women’s sporting event in history. A staggering $35 billion (that’s with a “b”) in bets were laid on the men’s tournament last year.  
 Since it shifted online in the 1990s, the age-old practice of betting on sports has spread across the globe and is in the midst of a major boom. While this is a boon for the industry, it also demands that responsible companies take steps to ensure that the needs of customers are not trampled in the stampede for profit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting on Jan. 29, advertisers of cryptocurrency coin trusts targeting the U.S. market will have to meet certain requirements before promoting these on Google. According to the internet giant, violation of this new policy will not result in the immediate suspension of advertisers’ respective accounts, the multinational technology company said. 
 
Advertisers Must Be Certified by Google
 
Google has announced that starting on Jan. 29, 2024, advertisers of cryptocurrency coin trusts targeting the U.S. market will be required to meet certain requirements. Advertisers of such trusts must apply and get a certificate issued by Google before they start promoting their offerings to the public.
 
According to Google, the so-called cryptocurrency coin trusts are financial products that enable investors to trade shares in trusts holding large pools of digital currency. Google, which has not provided a comprehensive list of the requirements, reminded advertisers they still need to adhere to relevant local regulations.
 
“As a reminder, we expect all advertisers to comply with the local laws for any area that their ads target. This policy will apply globally to all accounts that advertise these products,” Google said.
 
 
However, violation of this new policy will not result in the immediate suspension of advertisers’ respective accounts. Instead, a warning will be issued seven days before the account suspension. To learn more about how to obtain the certificate as well as the restrictions on financial products, Google has asked advertisers to visit its ads policy help page on its website.
 
On this page, Google lists country-specific requirements that advertisers for crypto-related products must satisfy before promoting their products. Google’s issues with crypto advertising date back to 2018, when the company first introduced formal restrictions.

However, Hoskinson ended up tagging an X account to a token with a dog theme that has the same name as his dog. This originally drew the interest of the cryptocurrency community and investors towards the meme coin.
