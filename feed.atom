        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has published a report on cryptocurrencies and explains that the technology has serious “flaws.” BIS researchers insist that permissionless blockchains have “inherent limitations” that lead to network congestion and high fees. 
 
BIS Report: ‘Crypto Has So Far Failed to Harness Innovation to the Benefit of Society’
 
In its latest report, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) claims that cryptocurrencies in their present form are not suited to work with the global economy. BIS researchers stress that while the industry “operates under the banner of decentralization,” in practice “centralized intermediaries have played a key role in channeling funds into the crypto universe and intermediating within it.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent development, Polygon Labs has unveiled a proposal to upgrade its native token, MATIC, to a new token called POL. The announcement, made through a blog post, introduces POL as a next-generation protocol token that aims to become a major driving force for the coordination and growth of the ecosystem, positioning it as the Value Layer of the Internet.
 
Polygon: MATIC Becomes POL
 
The proposal, outlined in a comprehensive white paper by a group of Polygon founders and researchers, introduces POL as a third-generation native asset, characterized as a hyperproductive token. According to them, POL enhances the functionality of native tokens by allowing validators to validate multiple chains and enabling each chain to offer multiple roles and corresponding rewards to validators.

        <updated>2023-07-13T12:48:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin retreated from recent gains on Thursday, as traders were unable to sustain a breakout of a key resistance level. Market volatility has risen following yesterday’s U.S. inflation report, which dropped to a two-year low. Ethereum was marginally lower, slipping below $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated below the $31,000 level in today’s session, as traders continued to digest the latest inflation report.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $30,228.84 earlier in today’s session, a day after peaking at $30,959.97.
 
The drop came as bulls were unable to sustain a breakout above a key resistance level at the $30,800 zone.
 
 
From the chart, this coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failing to break out of its own ceiling at 61.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 59.30, with a floor of 55.00 a possible target should momentum continue to slip.
 
Should this occur, there is a good chance that bitcoin will move below $30,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
After a brief stint above $1,900, ethereum (ETH) also moved lower on Thursday, with a moving average crossover close to occurring.
 
Following a high of $1,901.15 on Wednesday, ETH/USD fell to a bottom at $1,864.50 earlier in today’s session.
 
Similar to BTC, this drop came as ethereum fell below a recent resistance level of $1,890, and towards a floor at $1,850.
 
 
One of the reasons for this was due to the RSI failing to move past a ceiling at 53.00. It is currently hovering at 52.56.
 
Overall, momentum seems to be bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average likely to race past the 25-day (blue) trend line momentarily.
 
In the event this takes place, bears could target exits at $1,795.

“So quick bright things come to confusion” 
–William Shakespeare, “A Midsummer Night's Dream”

“Inscriptions” are a way of writing pieces of arbitrary information onto the Bitcoin blockchain. “Ordinals” are a convention used for tracking individual sats and linking them to inscriptions. This article does not attempt to argue for or against Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions. Rather, it argues against the confusing, inaccurate and sometimes dubious ways they can be presented, marketed and sold. 
It deals with a widespread fallacy which insinuates that ownership of Ordinal inscriptions is enforced and protected by the rules of the Bitcoin protocol itself (I maintain that it is not). And while this fallacy may be asserted duplicitously or …]]></summary>
