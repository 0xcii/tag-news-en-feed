This case offers a unique opportunity to attain much-needed regulatory clarity, which could ultimately promote growth and stability throughout the sector. Ripple should embrace this prospect wholeheartedly.
 
The following opinion editorial was written by Joseph Collement, General Counsel at Bitcoin.com.
 
Recent events, such as a rise in XRP’s value and an increase in open interest in the futures market, indicate mounting optimism about Ripple’s chances of triumphing in its lawsuit against the SEC. This positive sentiment is fueled by the anticipation that a Rippl…]]></summary>

Ethereum Sharks Are Driving The Price
 
According to Santiment, Ethereum shark addresses may have been behind the recent rally. In a report posted to Twitter, Santiment reveals that these accounts holding between 100-10,000 coins have been accumulating ETH at an accelerated rate over the last nine months.

creation of Bitcoin in 2009, digital currencies have gone a long way. Today,  
over 4,000 distinct cryptocurrencies are in use, with a total market

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin has been no stranger to issues, with its volatile value and speculative nature attracting both avid supporters and fierce critics. But despite its history of recovery over the years, the world’s most popular digital currency has faced its fair share of naysayers, a.k.a. “bears,” who have relentlessly predicted its downfall. 
 
Now, prominent cryptocurrency analyst and trader Bob Loukas has boldly taken to Twitter to share his expert opinion on when Bitcoin will finally be able to silence all the bears for good. 
 
With Bitcoin’s tumultuous past and uncertain future, the question on everyone’s mind is: can it truly rise above the bearish trends and become a dominant force in the world of finance?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the gold price rose 2.1% yesterday and is now close to an all-time high, the Bitcoin price is staging a new attempt today to break through the $28,8000 to $29,000 resistance area that has been in place since mid-March. The latest macroeconomic data and a gold price that continues to thrive may provide the impetus needed to break out of the current consolidation phase.
 
At $2,042 per ounce, gold is just a few dollars away from its 2020 record high of $2,069.40. The traditional safe haven asset is up 13% over the past month, while Bitcoin gained 27% over the past 30 days. Thus, both assets have risen in tandem (Bitcoin with a higher beta) in recent weeks.

The launch will allow Argentinians to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies directly with local pesos, which can be deposited to Binance via a local partner.  

However, the Argentinan market is not entirely new for Binance. The crypto exchange already offers peer-to-peer services, acting as an intermediary to match buyers and sellers.  

Argentina – A Perfect Country for Crypto  

The economy of Argentina is in shambles now as the inflation in the country went past 100 percent last February. It was the first time inflation in the South American country hit such levels since the hyperinflation in the early 1990s.
