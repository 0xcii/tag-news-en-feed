In the wake of lawsuits being launched by the SEC against massive exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, a former SEC official has warned of regulatory “siege” against crypto platforms, a judge has blocked efforts by the regulator to freeze Binance US’ assets, and economist Peter Schiff has said the Fed destroyed the U.S. banking system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New York-based digital assets platform Bakkt has decided to delist three prominent cryptocurrencies—Solana, Cardano, and Polygon—due to regulatory uncertainty and a lack of clarity. This move follows recent lawsuits filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against leading crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance, alleging the sale of unregistered securities, including Solana, Cardano, and Polygon.
 
The SEC’s legal actions marked the first time these three cryptocurrencies were specifically identified as securities. While SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has consistently asserted that most cryptocurrencies, except for Bitcoin, fall under the securities category, this regulatory development has prompted Bakkt and other crypto platforms to reassess their token listings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a recent letter viewed by the press, Elon Musk denies being a dogecoin (DOGE) whale in the lawsuit that accuses the Tesla executive of engaging in pump-and-dump activities with the meme coin token, which allegedly harmed retail investors. Musk’s attorney, Alex Spiro, stated in a written communication to the plaintiff’s lawyer that the claim of Musk owning specific wallets is “without basis” and he firmly asserts the plaintiffs “are wrong.”
