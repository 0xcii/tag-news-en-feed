        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, March 28, a hack occurred on Prisma Finance, a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum network. The exploiter carted away about 3,257.7 ETH (equivalent to $11.6 million) via a flash loan attack on the protocol.
 
On Friday, March 29, the Prisma Finance hacker transferred some of the proceeds from the theft to crypto mixer Tornado Cash in multiple transactions. According to PeckShield, $2.7 million in ETH was moved in one transaction and $3.8 million in another.
 
What’s most interesting is the hacker sent an on-chain message barely six hours after the attack through one of the addresses linked to the heist, claiming they are a “white hat hacker.” And the exploiter has continued to send on-chain messages to Prisma Finance’s team since the theft occurred.

While Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin applauds Worldcoin’s efforts to strengthen privacy measures, Portugal’s data regulator has thrown a wrench into the program by halting biometric data collection for 90 days.
 
 
Worldcoin’s system hinges on a unique approach. Instead of traditional signup methods like name and address, users submit iris scans to create a digital ID.
 
This anonymity is incentivized by offering free WLD cryptocurrency tokens. The program has garnered over 4.6 million users globally, but concerns about data privacy have dogged it from the start.

This potential shortage of available Bitcoin comes on the heels of the upcoming halving event, historically a bullish period for the world’s most popular cryptocurrency.
 
 
Bitcoin Demand Up?
 
CryptoQuant, a prominent on-chain data analytics firm, recently revealed a staggering increase in Bitcoin demand. Over the past month, monthly demand skyrocketed from 40,000 BTC to a whopping 213,000 BTC. This meteoric rise is attributed to a perfect storm of factors, including the launch of new Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and aggressive accumulation by high net worth investors, often referred to as “whales.”

Crypto analysts have given varying opinions on the future trajectory of the flagship crypto after the Halving takes place. Samson Mow’s prediction stands out from the rest, considering that he believes Bitcoin could rise to $1 million this year. If that is to happen, Bitcoin’s price would have to begin showing tremendous upside post-halving.
