        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/thailands-kasikorn-bank-97-stake-bitcoin-and-crypto-exchange"/>
        <updated>2023-10-30T13:00:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a strategic move that solidifies its presence in the cryptocurrency sector, Thailand's Kasikorn Bank has announced the acquisition of a 97% stake in Satang Corporation Company Limited, the parent company of the Satang cryptocurrency exchange.
The deal, valued at 3.705 billion Thai baht ($102.8 million), was conducted through a newly formed Kasikorn Bank subsidiary called Unita Capital, specifically created for investments in digital asset companies, according to local news sources.
Kasikorn is the country's second-largest bank by assets under management, according to 2023 data from Statista.
Following the finalization of the acquisition, Satang Corporation will be rebranded as Orbix Trade Company Limited. 
In addition to the exchange services, the newly formed company will establish three additional subsidiaries: Orbix Custodian, Orbix Invest (a digital asset fund manager), and Orbix Technology, a blockchain technology developer.
Kasikorn's support for Bitcoin specifically, as opposed to other cryptocurrencies and digital tokens, is at this time unclear.
This announcement follows K-Bank's recent launch of a $100 million fund designed to target investments in web3, fintech, and artificial intelligence. Its counterpart, Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), is also reportedly making notable strides into web3 and the cryptocurrency space. Both banks are vying to offer a full spectrum of crypto services permissible within the regulatory framework in Thailand.
SCB had earlier this year attempted a similar acquisition of a regional rival, though it was notably stalled over regulatory issues.
Kasikorn Bank has set an ambitious goal to capture 20% of the cryptocurrency market share in Thailand by the year 2024, marking its commitment notable at a time when many global banks remain on the sector's sidelines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum once again rallied above the $1,800 level on Monday, ahead of a highly significant week of U.S. economic data. Over the next few days consumer confidence, and nonfarm payrolls will be reported, ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting. Bitcoin continued to trade close to the $35,000 zone.
 
Bitcoin
 
On Monday, bitcoin remained near the $35,000 level, ahead of a key week of economic data from the United States.
 
BTC/USD peaked at the $34,743.26 mark to start the week, after falling to a low at $34,173.38 on Sunday.
 
This resulted in bitcoin moving closer to an 18-month high at $35,157, which was last struck on October 25.

Since hitting a low of $33,400 on Friday, BTC has made consecutive gains, and this comes after the relative strength index (RSI) found a stable floor at 79.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 82.52, which is still significantly above the overbought mark.
 
Should price now continue to increase, there is a good chance that price strength will edge closer to a ceiling at 87.00.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rose above the $1,800 level to start the week, following a second straight day in the green.
 
Following a low of $1,779.36 on Sunday, ETH/USD rose to a high of $1,827.13 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency rose to its highest point since last Thursday.

From the chart, it appears that the rally came as the RSI neared its long-term resistance level of 75.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 72.20, with ethereum marginally below its earlier peak at $1,817.

        <updated>2023-10-30T11:36:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A South African crypto investment platform has expressed hopes that an asset recovery proposal will result in users regaining access to funds blocked after its custody partner froze withdrawals. The crypto platform said it has also engaged regulators whom it hopes will help expedite resolution of the matter. 
 
No Timeline Given
 
The South African cryptocurrency investment platform Revix has said it is hopeful an asset recovery proposal put forward by its custody partner Haru Invest will ultimately result in users regaining access to blocked funds. However, Sean Sanders, the CEO of Revix, noted that while this may be positive news for users, his company is still unsure of when this process is set to be completed.
 
As previously reported by Bitcoin.com News in June, Revix began restricting users’ access to a portion (24%) of their funds. At the time, the crypto investment platform argued that the abrupt suspension of withdrawals by its South Korea-based custody partner had necessitated this decision.
 
 
Although some have drawn parallels between what happened to Celsius and Haru Invest, in his remarks published by Moneyweb, Sanders said it is still premature for anyone to make such conclusions.
 
“It’s not correct to compare Haru to Celsius just yet, as information hasn’t emerged on what exactly happened at Haru. However, Haru has publicly communicated that it plans to distribute assets it holds, which infers that there is value to be returned,” Sanders reportedly said.
 
The CEO added that his firm will continue to monitor the recovery efforts as well as ensure users get the highest possible value. According to the Moneyweb report, Revix has engaged regulators with the hopes that this will also help expedite the resolution of the matter.
