The bill also seeks to prohibit federal agencies from “proposing a rule that would impair a person’s ability to act as a self-custodian of digital assets.”
 
Keep Your Coins Act Introduced in Senate
 
Senator Ted Budd (R-NC) announced Tuesday that he has introduced the Keep Your Coins Act, which “would protect an individual’s right to conduct transactions with cryptocurrency assets without the need to utilize a third-party intermediary.” Specifically, the bill seeks to “prohibit Federal agencies from restricting the use of convertible virtual currency by a person to purchase goods or services for the person’s own use, and for other purposes.”

Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo took to X (formerly Twitter) to share their analysis for the Dogecoin price. The post highlights a possible Dogecoin uptrend that could carry it above the $0.1 mark. Kale explains that this move might be fast given DOGE’s history of rapidly rallying, and it could start in a week or two.
