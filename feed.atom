        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano climbed for a second consecutive session on Dec. 23, as the token surged to its highest point since Monday. Overall, crypto prices were marginally higher as of writing, with the global market cap currently up 0.49%. Xrp, formerly known as ripple, also rose, with prices nearing a key resistance level.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was in the green on Friday, as prices surged for a second straight session.
 
ADA/USD raced to a high of $0.2623 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after the token was trading at $0.2482.
 
The move saw the token climb towards a resistance level of $0.2685, and it is currently trading at its highest point since Monday.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, Friday’s gains come as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has moved closer to a ceiling of its own at 32.00.
 
The index is currently tracking at 30.18, with the price slipping from earlier highs, and trading at $0.2586 as of writing.
 
In order for bulls to hit the ceiling at the $0.2685 mark, this upcoming ceiling of 32.00 on the RSI must first be broken.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, also rose on Friday, as the token extended a recent bull run, in hopes of breaking out of a key resistance point.
 
Following a low of $0.3424, XRP/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.3531 earlier in today’s session.
 
Today’s high is the strongest point that the token has traded at since Sunday, when it was at a top of $0.3555.
 
 
Despite this recent climb in price, sentiment in XRP still appears to be bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) extending its downwards cross with the 25-day (blue) MA.
 
In addition to this, the 14-day RSI is currently tracking at 39.65, which is close to a ceiling of 41.00.
 
If bulls are unable to force a breakout of this level, we will likely see XRP once again move lower.

The crypto exchange had done so in a bid to assure users that all deposited funds were safe and that it was not going to collapse like FTX, but this had backfired spectacularly for the company. As the FUD ramped up, more than $6 billion was withdrawn from the exchange in a matter of days. Now, Binance has come forward to address the most pressing questions from the community.
 
Binance Says Assets Are Fully Backed
 
In a blog post published on its website on Friday, Binance addressed the most prominent questions from community members over the last two weeks, and that is whether the exchange had enough funds to back all user deposits.

This is an opinion editorial by Kal Kassa, an Ethiopian Bitcoiner.
2022 was an exciting year for the global Bitcoin community, and particularly African Bitcoiners. With a large population that is much younger than many other continents, the 54 countries of Africa are increasingly primed for Bitcoin with a growing arsenal of educators, advocates and developers. 
As we look toward the future of what is possible with sovereign money, especially in the areas of the world that can benefit most, it’s helpful to review some of the news and highlights to come out of Ethiopia, a country that could emerge as one of the leaders in Bitcoin adoption and innovation in the year to come.

        <updated>2022-12-23T13:36:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum edged closer to a key resistance level of $1,230 on Dec. 23, as markets continued to react to better than expected U.S. GDP data. Gross domestic product in the United States was revised higher to 3.2%, better than the 2.9% expected. Bitcoin mostly consolidated in today’s session, with prices trading near the $16,800 mark.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was once again in consolidation on Friday, as markets continued to react to the latest U.S. Q3 GDP figures.
 
Following a low of $16,592.41 on Thursday, BTC/USD was marginally higher, with prices rising to a peak of $16,880.87 in today’s session.
 
The surge in price pushed BTC above a key resistance point of $16,800, as bulls once again attempted to recapture the $17,000 mark.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, recent price uncertainty comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) remains close to a floor at 45.00.
 
Sentiment also seems uncertain following a recent crossover between the red 10-day moving average, and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
If this downward trend continues, we could see BTC trading near $16,000 during the Christmas weekend.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was marginally higher to end the week, as prices moved closer to a key resistance level earlier today.
 
ETH/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1,224.21 in Friday’s session, less than 24 hours after hovering at $1,187.13.
 
Today’s move sees ETH bulls once again try to break out of the long-term resistance level of $1,230.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 14-day RSI is now rallying above a resistance point at 47.00, and tracking at 47.92, with the next visible ceiling at 52.00
 
In order for bulls to continue to push ethereum higher, price strength will likely need to surge towards this upcoming resistance of 52.00.

The layoffs have taken a significant toll on employee morale and have damaged the foundations of certain corporate giants.
