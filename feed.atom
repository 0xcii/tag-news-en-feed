        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex has agreed  
to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) USD $24 million in fines.  
The settlement is related to allegations that the cryptocurrency  
exchange offered unregistered securities to investors in the US.
According to the  
regulator, Bittrex operated as a securities exchange, broker, and  
clearinghouse without obtaining proper registration. Of the sum Bittrex will  
pay the regulator, USD $14.4 million constitutes disgorgement, with an  
additional USD $4 million as prejudgment interest and USD $5.6 million in civil

However, unlike some countries where these central bank-issued digital currencies seem to be picking up steam, Canadians have not been as welcoming. To this end, the Bank of Canada has carried out a new study to figure out what the hindrances are when it comes to CBDC adoption in the country.
 
The Roadblocks To CBDC Adoption
 
In the discussion paper titled “Unmet Payment Needs and a Central Bank Digital Currency,” the Bank of Canada highlights that one of the prominent factors serving as a hindrance to CBDC adoption in the country is that Canadians do not really have a need to.
