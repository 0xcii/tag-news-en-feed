Why Dogecoin Reaching An $80 Billion Market Cap Isn’t A New ATH
 
Dogecoin community member John Carter explained in an X post that DOGE reaching an $80 billion market won’t mark a new ATH for the meme coin primarily due to its inflationary status. The meme coin has an infinite supply, meaning that more DOGE tokens will keep entering into circulation.
