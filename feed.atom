However, the SEC has previously expressed concerns about the potential for market manipulation related to Bitcoin prices and has cited this as a reason for rejecting previous applications for BTC ETFs. 
 
To address this concern, BlackRock has partnered with Nasdaq to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with an operator of a spot trading platform for Bitcoin.

The iShares Bitcoin Trust, filed by BlackRock, differs from other proposed BTC ETFs in key ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On June 15, the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced that customers can now earn 4% rewards on the stablecoin USDC. The news follows Coinbase’s current dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the firm’s staking-as-a-service product.
 
Coinbase Rolls Out 4% Stablecoin Rewards for Global Customers, Except Hawaii Residents
 
Coinbase is now allowing users to earn 4% rewards by holding USDC on the centralized cryptocurrency trading platform, according to a Thursday announcement. “Grow your savings with a rewarding, secure digital dollar,” Coinbase announced. “Global Coinbase customers can now earn 4% rewards on USDC.” Coinbase explains that as little as $1 in USDC can be held on the exchange to earn rewards.
 
Coinbase’s most recent USDC rewards service comes in the wake of the exchange being sued by the SEC. The complaint alleges that the firm “failed to register its staking-as-a-service program as required by securities laws.” Additionally, the Alabama securities regulator contends that Coinbase violated state securities regulations by “offering its staking rewards program accounts to Alabama residents without a registration to offer or sell these securities.”
 
 
Regarding the recent USDC rewards service, Coinbase specifies that the annual percentage rate (APR) of 4% is subject to change. “The rewards rate is subject to change and can vary,” the exchange explained on Thursday. “Customers will be able to see the latest applicable rates directly within their accounts.”
 
The Coinbase rewards program is accessible in 71 countries, including the United States, but excludes residents of Hawaii. To participate, Coinbase customers must be verified at tier two, the exchange’s latest announcement concludes.
 
What are your thoughts on Coinbase’s decision to offer 4% rewards on USDC amidst its ongoing dispute with the SEC? We’d love to hear your perspective in the comments section below.]]></summary>

local unit in France is being investigated by public prosecutors in Paris over ‘illegal’ provision of crypto services before it was licensed  
in May last year, CoinDesk reports. The exchange is also being probed for ‘acts of  
aggravated money laundering”, the outlet said, citing the French city’s public  
prosecutor’s office. 
Local  
French daily, Le Monde, also reported receiving the same information from the  
prosecutor’s office. The outlet said Binance is suspected to have been offering digital  
asset services in the country since 2020. The exchange is also being scrutinized over the likelihood it engaged in crypto promotion  
before it became registered.

Whether the tokens created by Terraform Labs constitute securities is central to the SEC’s fraud case, alleging that the company defrauded investors and sold billions of dollars in unregistered securities.
 
 
Terraform Labs’ Coins In The Hot Seat
 
The SEC’s complaint alleges that Terraform Labs and Kwon misled investors about the stability of TerraUSD and falsely claimed that their crypto tokens would increase in value. 
 
At a hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff questioned whether Terraform Labs’ offering of an Anchor protocol, which…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a Fortune report published on June 16, the cryptocurrency asset platform Bakkt is delisting three cryptocurrencies due to the current regulatory climate. Bakkt’s general counsel stated that the platform will expand its coin offering once there is “further clarity.”
 
Bakkt Reacts to Regulatory Pressure, Delists Solana, Polygon, and Cardano
 
Bakkt, the New York-based digital asset platform, revealed Friday that it is delisting solana (SOL), polygon (MATIC), and cardano (ADA). The move comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intensifies its scrutiny of cryptocurrency platforms and designates certain assets as unregistered securities.
 
The announcement of Bakkt’s delisting of SOL, MATIC, and ADA was made by the company’s general counsel and secretary, Marc D’Annunzio, in an interview with Fortune. D’Annunzio stated that the proactive removal would continue “until there is further clarity on how to compliantly offer a more extensive list of coins.”
 
Prior to Bakkt’s decision, the digital trading platform Robinhood has chosen to delist cardano (ADA), solana (SOL), and polygon (MATIC). Similarly, Tel Aviv-based Etoro has announced the delisting of ALGO, MANA, DASH, and MATIC for U.S. customers, citing the same reasons. Both Robinhood and Etoro said the firms are implementing proactive measures until regulatory clarity is established in the United States.
 
 
All the tokens that were previously listed on Bakkt, Robinhood, and Etoro and subsequently delisted have been classified as unregistered securities by the U.S. SEC. The SEC’s enforcement lawsuits also identify XRP, TON, OMG, POWR, BTT, KIN, TRX, MIR, EMAX, ALGO, and IHT, among others, as securities.
 
Are the recent delistings by Bakkt, Robinhood, and Etoro a necessary step towards regulatory compliance, or do they hinder innovation in the cryptocurrency space? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-16T17:33:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halfway through June, crypto markets have been rocked by several macro factors, which have brought bears to return to action. Bitcoin has moved below $25,000 for the first time since March, as the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued both Binance and Coinbase. The Federal Reserve has also paused its rate hike policy, with traders still unsure of what this could mean for markets.
 
Current Market Status
 
The action taken by the SEC earlier this month has been the main source of bearishness, with the regulator moving to crack down on operators in the space.
 
Following this, inflation in the United States fell to lower than expected, coming in at a low of 4%, briefly boosting the U.S. dollar.
 
However, with the Fed opting to keep rates unchanged for now, market uncertainty has heightened, with traders processing the potential long-term impacts of tighter monetary policy.
 
June Outlook
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rose back above $25,000 on Friday, as traders moved to buy the recent dip in price.
 
The world’s largest cryptocurrency plunged to its weakest point since March 16 earlier this week, triggered by the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision.
 
Bulls that have returned to BTC in recent days would have done so due to prices being oversold, with the relative strength index (RSI) hovering below the 30.00 mark.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the index has now broken out of a ceiling at 43.00, and is tracking at 43.26, which has prompted a rise in momentum.
 
The next visible point of resistance is at the 50.00 mark, and 57.00 thereafter. Should bulls move beyond both of these, BTC will likely be trading above $27,500 in the next few weeks.
 
Where will bitcoin end the month? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.]]></summary>

Several On-Chain Indicators Spiked While Tether Suffered A Depeg
 
In the past couple of days, USDT became decoupled from its $1 peg as the stablecoin’s value plunged to $0.996. Since then, however, the asset has seen some recovery, although the $1 peg is yet to be regained as Tether still trends under $0.999.
 
While this isn’t the first time that the largest stablecoin by market cap has observed destabilization, it’s natural that this depegging event has still led to the emergence of fresh FUD in the market.
