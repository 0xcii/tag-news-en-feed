        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The highly anticipated Dencun upgrade for the Ethereum blockchain won’t be making its debut in 2023 as initially expected. Ethereum’s core developers have decided to push back the upgrade’s release until at least 2024, a revelation made during the latest All Core Developers meeting. After the meeting, software developer Tim Beiko took to social media to provide an update on the expected timeline for the upgrade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitfinex has recently come under scrutiny. The  
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) raised concerns about the cryptocurrency  
exchange today (Friday), warning investors of potential risks associated with it.  
The regulator stated that Bitfinex may be promoting financial services or  
products without its permission. 
Finance Magnates contacted Bitfinex for comments. However, at the time of this publication, a representative from the company had not responded to the inquiry. 
"If you deal with this firm, you won't have  
access to the Financial Ombudsman Service if you have a complaint," the

The Genesis Of Stimmy Coin (STIMMY)
 
Surfing through the X (formerly Twitter) posts related to the Stimmy Coin, it looks to be that the coin was created as a parody of the stimulus checks received by United States residents during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
 
 
The coin seemed to gain popularity quickly due to the founder being widely known in the Nigerian crypto community. The founder Feyi, whose X (formerly Twitter) account @feyi_x has over 84,000 followers, was ab…]]></summary>

Debasement refers to the action or process of reducing the quality or value of something. In relation to money, it traditionally refers to the practice of reducing the precious metal content in coins while keeping their nominal value the same, thereby diluting the coin’s intrinsic worth. In a modern context, debasement has evolved to mean the reduction in the value or purchasing power of a currency — such as when central banks increase the supply of money, thereby lowering the nominal value of each unit.
Understanding Debasement
Before paper money, currency consisted of coins made of precious metals like gold and silver. Debasement was a common practice to save on precious metals and use them in a mix of lower-value metals instead.

        <updated>2023-10-27T15:54:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin was a notable mover on Friday, as the cryptocurrency edged lower for a second straight session. Price fell by as much as 4% earlier in the day, as price approached a breakout below the $2.00 mark. On the other hand, solana continued to trade around the $33.00 mark.
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin dropped for a second straight day on Friday, as bears pushed the cryptocurrency close to a breakout below the $2.00 level.
 
Following a high of $2.17 during yesterday’s session, TON/USD slipped to an intraday low of $2.07 earlier today.
 
As a result of the decline, toncoin continued to track a one-week low, and close to a key price floor of $2.00.
 
 
One reason TON remains above the aforementioned level is as a result of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is above its own floor at 50.00.
 
In the event that this point is broken, there is a strong possibility that bearish sentiment will significantly increase.
 
If so, traders will possibly be targeting a lower support point of $1.90.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) made slight gains earlier in the day, as the token hovered close to a one-year low above $33.00.
 
SOL/USD rose to a peak of $33.30 during today’s session, after falling to a low at $30.80 on Thursday.
 
Earlier gains have since faded, with the world’s seventh largest cryptocurrency now trading at $32.37.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the 14-day RSI is marginally above a floor at 74.00, with a current reading of 74.43.
 
Should bulls sustain this level, there is a good chance that solana could make another run towards $35.00.
