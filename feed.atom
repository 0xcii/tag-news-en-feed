However, the analyst warned that the foremost meme coin would unlikely record the moves the market witnessed in the 2021 bull run when DOGE’s price rose by over 20,000%. 
 
 
Altcoin Sherpa added that Dogecoin should still be able to record a few price gains, though. He noted that the meme coin has strong liquidity and suggested that investors should still consider invest…]]></summary>
