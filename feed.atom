        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With MiCA having passed in the European Parliament last week, the EU looks set to be the first region, globally, to have a comprehensive framework of crypto regulation in place. The rules won’t take effect until 2024, and in the meantime, crypto industry players are preparing to be compliant.
 To get an insight into what these preparations entail, and what the future for crypto now looks like under MiCA, in the EU and more widely, Finance Magnates spoke to Jack Ehlers, the Chief Operating Officer and General Manager for Europe at Bitstamp, which was this month recognized by the digital asset data provider, CCData as the world’s top-rated centralized crypto exchange.

This isn’t the first time we’ve seen the Twitter CEO’s influence on the crypto world, as he’s been known to stir up price movements with his tweets on Dogecoin and other meme coins. 
 
It’s no secret that when Musk speaks, the market listens – and in the case of Cult DAO, it’s clear that his words can still figuratively move mountains in the world of cryptocurrency.

Banks in Russian Federation Headed for at Least $23 Billion in Profits in 2023
 
Data from the first months of 2023 give the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) reason to believe that by the end of the year Russian banks can earn 1.9 trillion rubles (almost $24 billion), “or even more, which is comparable to the profit for 2021,” Deputy Governor Olga Polyakova unveiled at a conference held by the National Credit Ratings (NCR) agency.

You can buy all the oil you want and it doesn’t give you access to Chevron profits, and you can be a Chevron shareholder but you have no control over the price of oil.”

Supreme Court justices will decide in the next term whether to overturn the decades-old precedent. The 1984 Chevron Deference, named for the court’s decision in Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council…]]></summary>

Now Marco Santori, the company's chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: "Kraken's master account application has not yet been rejected."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
