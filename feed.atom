Oversight of Crypto Tax Compliance
The ATO's notice, issued last month, aims to identify  
individuals who may have failed to report their crypto transactions. It focuses  
on instances where crypto assets were exchanged or utilized for payments

Based on the technical analysis of the cryptocurrency’s price action across previous market cycles, the crypto analyst noted that Chainlink was presently undergoing a retest at its low point.

If you know anything about Bitcoin’s ethos and underlying tech, you’ve likely heard of this concept before. But do you know exactly how that works and why Bitcoin is more suitable as a store of value than your bank?

The Problem With Banks
The first problem with banks is their custodial nature, and with that, the risk of rehypothecation inherent to fractional reserve banking. If banks were simply means of warehousing cash for their clients, using them would only imply counterparty risk. While not ideal, this would not necessarily be a problem if banks simply let customer funds sit there, …]]></summary>

As pointed out by BTC on-chain research account “The Bitcoin Researcher” in a post on X, the Coin Days Destroyed In Profit metric has declined recently. A “coin day” is a quantity that 1 BTC accumulates after staying dormant on the blockchain for 1 day. Thus, when a coin sits still in the same address for a while, it carries some number of coin days.
 
 
When a coin like this is finally moved on the network, its coin days count resets back to zero, and the coin days that it had been holding are said to be “destroyed.” The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) keeps track of the total amount of coin days…]]></summary>
