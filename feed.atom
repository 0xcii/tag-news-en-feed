        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Circle, the developer of the USDC stablecoin, is set to introduce a native version of its token on the Arbitrum network. The move aims to enhance transaction speeds and improve interoperability within the blockchain ecosystem. Circle has scheduled the launch of the new native version of USD Coin for June 8. 
 
Transitioning to a Native USDC on Arbitrum
 
In an official blog post, Circle outlined its plan to replace the existing version of USD Coin, which is currently an Ethereum-based token bridged to Arbitrum.
 
 
The new native token will operate directly on the Arbitrum network and will become the official version of USDC within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This transition will eventually phase out the bridged version of USDC originating from Ethereum.

Central Bank Says Report Contains ‘Destabilising Innuendos’
 
The Nigeria central bank has rejected reports it had devalued the local currency to 630 per dollar and branded the report in the Daily Trust “fake news.” In a statement issued shortly after news of the naira’s supposed devaluation went viral, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) insisted that the report “is replete with outright falsehoods and destabilising innuendos.” The apex bank claimed that the…]]></summary>

But amidst this significant decline in profitability, a mining company, ClarkSpark, defies the trend by aggressively expanding its mining machine fleet this year. This shows that profitability issues are not holding back mining companies.
 
 
The firm revealed its latest move on June 1, purchasing 12,500 brand-new Antminer S19 XP units for a staggering $40.5 million. 
 
Notably, the deal was secured at a remarkable rate of $23 per terahash per second (TH/s), significantly lower than the present average market price.

Ripple Moves 900 Million Tokens Back To Escrow
 
On June 1, Ripple carried out one of its scheduled token unlocks of 1 billion XRP tokens. These unlocks are already set ahead of time to ensure that there is a controlled release of supply into the market, allowing investors to anticipate what was coming.
 
 
These tokens are brought into supply based on the demand and growth in the market, and sometimes not all of the tokens are utilized, which means the unused coins go back into escrow. This was the case this time around as only 10% of the entire 1 billion unloc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano ended a four-day losing streak on Friday, as markets responded to the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report. Payrolls in May rose to 339,000, which was significantly higher than the expected sum of 190,000. Solana collided with a key resistance level in today’s session.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was one of Friday’s notable gainers, as the token snapped a key resistance level.
 
ADA/USD rose by as much as 3% in today’s session, hitting an intraday high of $0.3777 as a result.
 
This rally resulted in the 10-day (red) moving average crossing over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Typically such an upwards crossover signals the start of a bull run, and it comes as the relative strength index (RSI) also rose considerably.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 50.91, which is marginally below a resistance level at 52.00.
 
In the event this ceiling is broken, there is a strong chance that ADA will move towards the $0.3800 mark.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) also climbed higher in today’s session, with prices colliding with a key resistance level in the process.
 
Following a low of $20.38 on Thursday, SOL/USD surged to a peak at $21.30 earlier in the day.
 
Since hitting the aforementioned ceiling at $21.30, momentum has somewhat weakened, due to bulls securing earlier gains.
 
 
Another reason for this is that the RSI is close to a resistance level of its own at 55.00, leading traders to act more tentatively.
 
The index is currently tracking at 53.64, and should it eventually cross the hard line at 55.00, bullish pressure will likely increase.
 
Some may expect this to happen over the weekend, as traders continue to digest today’s economic data.

The “halving” here refers to a periodic event where the block rewards (that is, the rewards that the miners receive for solving blocks on the network) are permanently cut in half.
 
The halvings are always quite significant for Bitcoin as the block rewards are the only way new BTC is produced/minted, so their being halved tightens the production of the asset.
