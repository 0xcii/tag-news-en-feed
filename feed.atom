        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Congressman John Rose of Tennessee introduced the “BRIDGE Digital Assets Act,” one of the most important legislative proposals with changes in the regulatory landscape of crypto assets in the United States.
 
 
It provides for a Joint Advisory Committee consisting of participants from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It would, therefore, look to harmonize the sometimes-conflicting regulations existing presently between the two agencies for digital assets, coming under both securities and commodities jurisdictions.
 
Rose argues that the “regulation-by-enforcement” approach stifles innovation and drives investment overseas, requiring the United States to create an environment friendlier to digital asset development.

In the 102-page appeal, the legal representatives of the FTX founder accused Judge Lewis Kaplan of being unfairly biased in the previous trial.
A Biased Judge?
Bankman-Fried, the former crypto billionaire who once made significant political donations, was convicted on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud by a New York jury last November for his fraudulent business practices with the now-collapsed FTX and its affiliates. The conviction was followed by a 25-year prison sentence in March by US District Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York (SDNY).
