        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s downturn continued on Friday, as prices fell for a third consecutive session, leading to a move below $28,000. Market sentiment has shifted in recent days, as traders began taking profits from last week’s high. Ethereum was also lower, and is now trading around the $1,900 region.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved lower for a third consecutive session on Friday, as prices slipped below the $28,000 mark.
 
Following a high of $28,906.25 on Thursday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,855.96 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this move, bitcoin fell to its weakest point since April 9, which is the last time price hit a floor of $27,800.

Since nearing this point, BTC bulls have reentered the market, and have pushed price back above $28,000.
 
One of the catalysts for today’s drop came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell to a floor of its own at 46.00.
 
The index has marginally risen from this low, and is tracking at 46.35 at the time of writing.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also edged lower, with price nearing a breakout below the $1,900 mark.
 
Two days after hitting a peak at $2,105, ETH/USD dropped to a low of $1,904.42 earlier in today’s session.
 
This decline has resulted in the world’s second largest cryptocurrency now trading at its lowest level in eight-days.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, ethereum is trading nearly 10% lower than at the same time last week, when it rose above $2,000 for the first time since last May.
 
The RSI has also significantly dropped, with the index breaking out of a floor at the 53.00 level, and it is now at a reading of 49.46.
 
Should momentum continue to fall, bears will likely be targeting a point of support at 44.50.

Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Ratio Has Continued To Decline Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, bull markets in the past have started with US exchanges increasing their holdings. The relevant indicator here is the “exchange reserve ratio,” which measures the ratio between the exchange reserves of any two exchange platforms or groups of them.
 
The “exchange reserve” here refers to a metric that tells us about the total amount of Bitcoin that’s currently sitting in the wallets of a centralized exchange (or in the combined wallets of several platforms).

This is an opinion editorial by Trey Walsh, the senior director for youth programs at the MassHire Metro North Workforce Board in Somerville, Massachusetts.
Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has caught the world by storm, leaving many stumped by its continued adoption and growing number of use cases, and leading many others to continually dismiss it or manufacture cultural and political narratives about it to satisfy their own agendas. 
We will never know the true intentions behind the creation of Bitcoin due to the pseudonymity of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, but it is widely believed that Bitcoin was created…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he's living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. "I don't care if you're capitalist or you're a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We've passed the point where that debt is becoming useful," he said. "And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that's outside of the traditional banking system."]]></summary>
