Biden officials call the downgrade decision “bizarre and baseless.” Both the White House and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen strongly disagreed with the downgrade decision.

In this article, we’ll refute — with evidence — why the block reward halving is nothing more than a correlation, not causation of bull markets.

Bitcoin price continues to meander mostly sideways for going on its sixth month. Few expect any type of movement to the upside until after the next block reward halving. The recurring event happening every four years, is scheduled for approximately April 2024.
 

 
 
Looking at the 1M BTCUSD price chart, it is very easy to see why, upon visual inspection, one might assume that Bitcoin rises after the halving and that it is pretty much a sure thing at this point.

How The Scammer Stole $20 Million In USDT
 
The eye-popping heist was the result of a perfectly executed zero-transfer phishing attack. To carry out the theft, the hackers had to create an address that looked similar to the receiver’s address. 
 
 
An on-chain data report from Peckshield shows that the scammer created a spoofed transaction that looked like a legitimate transfer of USDT from the victim’s wallet 0xa7Bf48749D2E4aA29e3209879956b9bAa9E90570, the scammer’s wallet address. However, no funds were actually moved. Following this, the victim unknowingly sent $20 million to the scammer’s address. …]]></summary>
