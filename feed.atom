According to a July 15 report by Reuters, the SEC approval  
is now only contingent on the applicants submitting final offering documents to  
the regulator before the end of this week. The report cited three industry  
sources.
Ether ETFs Launch Imminent
The asset managers mentioned in the report include  
BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck. Additionally, Fidelity, ARK

Crypto Taxation Could Be Delayed Another Three Years
 
A local media outlet reported that South Korean lawmakers have proposed postponing the enforcement of crypto taxation in the country again. Originally, the government proposed implementing a 20% tax on crypto gains by January 2022.
 
The new rule has been postponed twice, with the latest delay setting the implementation date to January 2025. If passed, the new bill, proposed by the South Korean ruling party, would push the crypto tax date to 2028, a six-year delay from the original date.

Crypto Bitlord urged everyone in an X post to buy and hold XRP. His statement seemed to have come as a surprise to some of his followers, given XRP’s underperformance since the start of the year. When quizzed by one of them about what he believed XRP was going to make a run soon, Crypto Bitlord suggested that massive news was on the horizon that could positively impact XRP’s price.
