Litecoin Whales Accumulated 100,000 LTC Recently
 
As pointed out by an X user using data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the LTC whales have recently bought while the cryptocurrency’s price has declined.
 
The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total amount of Litecoin that the different wallet groups in the market are holding right now.
 
 
Addresses or investors are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins they are carrying in their balance currently. The 1-10 coins group, for instance, includes holders owning at least 1 and at most 10 LTC.

from real users, a recent study by Visa and Allium Labs revealed. These  
findings raise questions about the potential of stablecoins revolutionizing the

sentiment. 
 Stablecoin Potential in Payments
Out of a staggering $2.65 trillion in total stablecoin transactions in the past 30 days, a mere $265 billion is attributed to "organic  
payments activity," highlighting the prevalence of non-user transactions.  
This data was highlighted in a dashboard aimed at analyzing stablecoin  
transactions to differentiate between authentic user activity and artificial  
volume.

In fact, the name ‘dodo’ likely originated from the Portuguese word, ‘simpleton’. The dodo bird lived very comfortably for much of its existence on an isolated island that lacked any natural predators. Over time the dodo bird grew bigger, and its wings grew smaller. Growing larger while having no predators emboldened the mighty dodo bird to become increasingly fearless. 
And then humans showed up. And everything changed. Instantly. 
The rapid and dramatic environmental changes left the dodo bird helpless. Because it was flightless, it couldn’t escape. It needed wings to survive but evolutionary processes don’t occur overnight, they take thousands of years. From happy, fat, and thriving to extinction. In the blink of an e…]]></summary>

Bitcoiners were craving something they could hang onto in the middle of the bear. Glimmers of hope were on the horizon and I intended to magnify those and hopefully rally the industry around a new technological narrative. Unfortunately, life had other plans and, to make a long story short, I quickly realized I bit off more than I could chew at the time. 
The Bitcoin Script Project never saw the light of the day. At best, it was a short-lived social awareness campaign. It seeded some ideas and moved the conversation forward.
