        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past year, the mining pool titan Foundry USA has consistently led the network in terms of hashrate. However, this month, the bitcoin mining operation Antpool has edged ahead of Foundry, albeit marginally, in hashrate rankings. In November, out of the 4,436 blocks that were mined, Antpool was responsible for uncovering 1,218 of them, translating to 27.46% of the month’s global hashrate.
 
Antpool Edges Out Foundry, Leads November Bitcoin Mining Surge
 
After a lengthy period where Foundry dominated, Antpool has recently emerged as a frontrunner in hashrate achievement. Particularly in November, Antpool succeeded in mining the highest number of blocks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MicroStrategy, known as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC), has again expanded its holdings. As revealed yesterday, the company purchased approximately 16,130 BTC in November (worth roughly $608 million at the current market rates). The acquisitions were executed at an average price of about $36,785 per Bitcoin, bringing MicroStrategy’s total holdings to 174,530 BTC.
 
The software firm, led by Michael Saylor, also disclosed its plans to potentially raise $750 million through the offering of class A common stock. Partners in this venture include Cowen and Company, Canaccord Genuity, and BTIG. This announcement, however, has sparked speculations across various social media platforms, suggesting that MicroStrategy might be grappling with a “debt problem.”

A wildfire needs a long period of no rain, high temperatures and then high winds at the point of ignition. 
Yes - wildfires have been exacerbated by record methane emissions that Bitcoin helps mitigate, but that’s not what this article’s about: this time it’s just an analogy. 
Halvings cause a drying up of new supply of Bitcoin (no rain). They draw increased interest in timing Bitcoin market entry (high temperature). But they also need high winds and an ignition event. 
That high wind is the winds of change around the Bitcoin ESG narrative.
