        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin, the first and most popular cryptocurrency, has been making headlines with its recent surge to a new all-time high of over $72,000.

Investors may see this surge as a validation of Bitcoin's potential as a long-term store of value and may allocate more of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies. However, the rapid rise in price may also raise concerns about potential volatility and the sustainability of such gains, prompting investors to carefully evaluate the risks before making investment decisions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin and the rest of crypto went through a brutal cycle in the last two years. Dubbed "crypto winter," the unforgiving market crushed the hopes of many traders, startup founders, and investors. 
Marked by scandals, regulatory uncertainty, and lots of FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt in crypto parlance), crypto winter brought down some of the industry's most significant projects and companies. 
However, the US SEC’s successive approvals of eleven spot BTC ETF applications on January 10, 2024, changed all perspectives, turning many bullish. 
It’s not just institutions that are optimistic about the development. Even smaller retail traders are excited about the new ETFs. If you are a retail trader sharing your strategies and showcasing a public crypto portfolio for your audience, the risin…]]></summary>

The decision marks the culmination of a months-long legal battle where both South Korea and the US sought Kwon’s extradition. Kwon, once hailed as the “cryptocurrency king,” vanished after the dramatic downfall of his crypto project Terra, which resulted in billions of dollars lost by investors. He was eventually apprehended in Montenegro last year while attempting to flee with forged travel documents.
