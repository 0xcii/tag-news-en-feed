With over 340,000 followers, CertiK’s X (formerly Twitter) account appears to have shared a fraudulent link and encouraged users to utilize it to protect themselves against a cyber crisis.
 
Bad Guys Penetrate CertiK Defenses
 
On their X page, CertiK included a phony Revoke Cash link that led visitors to a wallet drainer. Users were notified by the blockchain security firm of a vulnerability in the Uniswap Router contract that “was allowing attackers to shift anyone’s tokens if approved to the Uniswap contract” in a post that has since been removed.

These Altcoins Have A High Amount Of Active Addresses Right Now
 
In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed some altcoins that are seeing a high amount of address activity on their networks at the moment.
 
The relevant indicator here is the “daily active addresses,” which keeps track of the total number of unique addresses of a cryptocurrency that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on the blockchain.
 
 
The unique number of wallets can be equated with the number of unique users visiting the blockchain, so this metric’s value can tell us about how the traffic on the network is looking right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VanEck has announced that if its proposal for a spot  
Bitcoin ETF is approved, the asset management firm will allocate 5% of the  
fund's profits to support Bitcoin developers.
VanEck's application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the  
United States is among several others awaiting validation from the US  
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The imminent approval of such a fund's listing is  
poised to attract unprecedented investment from traditional finance into cryptocurrencies.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Crypto Adoption 
Acknowledging the potential surge in investment,  
VanEck's pledge to donate a percentage of ETF profits mirrors its prior  
commitment to Ethereum developers, Coindesk reported. Its dedication to contributing 10% of profits from  
an ether futures ETF to the Ethereum ecosystem last year highlighted the firm's  
involvement in supporting the fundamental layers of major cryptocurrencies.

We’re not Bitcoin tourists at VanEck. We’re in it for the long haul. That’s why we made an initial $10k donation and signed a pledge to donate 5% of our Bitcoin ETF profits (if approved) to support Bitcoin Core devs @bitcoinbrink for at least 10 years. Your tireless dedication to…
— VanEck (@vaneck_us) January 5, 2024
Amidst the anticipation of spot Bitcoin ETF  
approval, 2023 saw a resurgence in crypto investments. There was $2.25 billion  
worth of inflows into the sector, the third-largest since 2017, Finance Magnates reported. 
This surge marked a stark reversal from the previous  
year, 2022 when inflows were $831 million. The industry witnessed a visible  
acceleration in investments during the latter half of 2023, mirroring the  
widespread eagerness to launch the inaugural Wall Street BTC spot ETF.
Notably, Bitcoin emerged as the primary beneficiary,  
capturing $1.9 billion in inflows, representing 87% of the total, the most significant  
share on record.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

This issue is especially pertinent for newcomers in Western markets and communities in the global south, where the proportionally higher transaction costs can be especially burdensome.
