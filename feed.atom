        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase is acquiring a Cyprus-based entity with a MiFID  
license, paving the way for wider access to its derivatives products in Europe.
This strategic move aligns with  
Coinbase's "Go Broad, Go Deep" plan, aiming to establish clear  
regulatory frameworks and secure licenses for international expansion. The  
MiFID license will allow Coinbase to offer derivatives to eligible customers  
across select EU countries.
Coinbase Gears Up for EU Expansion
The acquisition targets the lucrative  
derivatives market, estimated to account for roughly 75% of the global crypto  
space. By expanding its derivatives offerings, Coinbase hopes to capture a  
significant share of this market and solidify its position as a leading crypto  
player.
Recognizing the importance of trust  
and compliance, Coinbase emphasizes its adherence to a rigorous Five-point  
Global Compliance Standard. This standard covers vetting personnel,  
implementing strict AML/KYC procedures, enforcing global sanctions, upholding  
governance best practices, and conducting ongoing monitoring and reporting.
Over 400 experienced compliance and  
legal professionals, with backgrounds in prestigious institutions like the FBI,  
DOJ, and major banks, guide Coinbase's compliance efforts. This expertise  
ensures adherence to international regulations and safeguards against potential  
risks.
While finalizing the acquisition and  
operationalizing the entity lie ahead, this move marks a significant step  
towards Coinbase's vision of a more global and open financial system. By  
providing wider access to derivatives within a robust compliance framework, Coinbase aims to  
empower more than 1 billion people with increased economic freedom.

Coinbase is planning a pivotal acquisition that will allow it to launch crypto derivatives in the EU https://t.co/7jH4kxkpf1
