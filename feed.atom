        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disgraced crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) faces a hefty 25-year prison sentence for masterminding the spectacular collapse of his FTX exchange, a Manhattan court ruled on Thursday. The sentence, though significant, represents only the opening chapter in a saga likely to continue through appeals and potential early release considerations.
 
 
Judge Lewis Kaplan highlighted the risk of SBF repeating his crimes, stating, “There is a risk that this man will be in a position to do something very bad in the future, and it’s not a trivial risk.”
 
Prosecutors echoed this concern, suggesting SBF’s ambition for political influence fueled his financial misdeeds.
