        <updated>2023-01-12T16:35:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avalanche was one of Thursday’s big gainers, as the token rose by as much as 22% in today’s session. The move came as inflation in the United States fell to 6.5% as markets were expecting. Polkadot was another notable mover, with prices climbing close to a four-week high. 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
Avalanche (AVAX) rose by as much as 22% in today’s session, as cryptocurrencies reacted to the latest U.S. inflation report.
 
AVAX/USD moved to a peak of $16.11 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after falling to a bottom of $12.41.
 
Thursday’s spike in price pushed avalanche to its highest point since November 8, when price was at a peak of $18.15.
 
 
Looking at the chart, earlier gains have somewhat eased, with AVAX now trading at $15.18.
 
This came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failed to break out from a resistance at the 80.00 level.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 69.94, which is still deep in overbought territory.
 
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT), was another big gainer in today’s session, with prices moving closer towards a four-week high.
 
Following a low of $4.84, DOT/USD managed to reach an intraday high of $5.16 earlier on Thursday.
 
As a result of this move, DOT broke out of a key resistance level of $5.15, hitting its strongest point since December 16 in the process.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the 14-day RSI has failed to move beyond its long-term ceiling of 68.00, and has since slipped lower.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 63.10, with DOT declining from its earlier peak, and the asset is trading at $5.09.
 
In order for the token to continue to move higher, there will first need to be a rally above its 68.00 point on the RSI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the Bitcoin price, the course for the rest of January may have been set today. The question was: Will Bitcoin continue its mini-bull run or will there be a correction? This was decided by today’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) release in the US at 8:30 am EST.
 
The baseline was relatively clear. Most estimates agreed that 6.5% is the magic line that will decide whether it is a bull or bear market in the short term. If the figure is 6.3% or lower, there will be a bull run as the US central bank projections from the last FOMC are no longer credible and will be thrown overboard.
 
At 6.3% to 6.5%, the market is likely to celebrate with restraint, although this may already be priced in. At 6.5% to 7.1%, there will be a sell-off.
 
And the estimates were spot on. The CPI came in at 6.5%

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin Twitter is a strong and vibrant community, but members should make sure they are in control of the energy they spend there.
This is an opinion editorial by Mark Maraia, a professional development author and Bitcoin researcher.
I’ve been studying Bitcoin since 2020 and I’ve noticed there is a strong, vibrant community on Twitter. In fact, “Bitcoin Twitter” is virtually its own “country” that exists online. 
I’ve had a Twitter account since 2009, but I never use it to tweet. There are several reasons for this (perhaps the subject of a different article) but, suffice to say, I’ve never found it to be a great use of my time. Like many Boomers, I see social media as a huge time and productivity drain. I also see it as perhaps the worst addiction of our age.

With stocks being highly correlated with digital currencies, a worsening macroeconomic situation would be devastating for the broader financial market. But with the World Bank predicting that the global economy can slip into recession, the crypto market recovery might not happen this year. 
 
 As the macro trends worsen, cash that is crucial for the recovery of the market will flow out as investors flock to safe haven assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose to a four-week high on Thursday, as price surged above $18,000 hours before the upcoming U.S. inflation report. This comes as many expect today’s figures to show a considerable drop in consumer prices. Ethereum also moved higher, climbing above $1,400 in the process.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) surged above $18,000 on Thursday, as markets prepared for a further drop in U.S. consumer prices.
 
BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $18,268.55 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $17,337.99.
 
Today’s move saw bitcoin climb to its strongest point since December 14, when prices were at a peak of $18,385.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to move deeper into overbought territory
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 75.98, which is its highest mark since October 2021.
 
Depending on this afternoon’s inflation rate, there could be a reversal in BTC, as earlier momentum may have already peaked.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also significantly higher in today’s session, with prices moving to a two-month high.
 
Following a low of $1,323.58 on Wednesday, ETH/USD jumped to a peak of $1,408.13 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this rally, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency is now trading at its strongest position since November 8.
 
 
Like with bitcoin earlier, the move has occurred as the RSI broke out of a ceiling at 69.00, and it is currently tracking at 75.89.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has continued its upwards crossover versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should this momentum maintain this trajectory, then the next target for bulls will likely be a ceiling of $1,470.
