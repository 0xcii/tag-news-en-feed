Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $27,000 mark on Friday, ahead of a panel discussion which will include Fed Chair Jerome Powell.
 
Markets anticipate some forward guidance from Powell regarding future decisions that the Federal Reserve could take in coming months.
 
Following a high of $27,466.53 on Thursday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,415.10 earlier today.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
The move, which saw the price fall by over $1,000, pushed bitcoin towards a key price floor at $26,300.
 
Friday’s slippage occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) once again dropped below a resistance of its own at the 42.00 mark.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 40.83, with bears possibly targeting a support point at the 38.00 zone.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also in the red in today’s session, with prices briefly breaking out of the $1,800 level.
 
ETH/USD fell to a bottom at $1,774.20 on Friday, which comes a day after hitting a high of $1,826.90.
 
The drop in price resulted in ethereum falling below a floor at $1,790. However, it has since rebounded.

Similar to BTC, ethereum’s RSI was unable to break out of a resistance point at 45.00, and is now at a reading of 44.83.
 
A sign of hope for bulls comes in the form of the 10-day (red) moving average, which moved closer to a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should this occur, there is a reasonable chance that ETH could climb towards $1,900.

Bitcoin Mid-Term Holders Have Been Shedding Their Supply Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a holder group has been showing signs of profit-taking recently. The indicator of interest here is the “sum coin age distribution,” which tells us about how the Bitcoin supply is distributed among the various cohorts currently.
 
These cohorts are divided based on the age of the coins that they are holding in their wallets right now. The 1-3 months old group, for example, contains all the holders that have been carrying their coins since at least 1 month and at most 3 months ago.

ASX's Project Director, Tim Whiteley, said in the meeting that the next attempt to develop a CHESS replacement would "go down the more conventional route, that is, without the focus on DLT (or) blockchain," adding "while we continue to explore all the options, certainly we will need to use a more conventional technology than in …]]></summary>

He's also figuring out how to upend what it means to be a music fan. The band launched a Deathbats Club NFT collection in 2021. That is to say: They were early. The lead singer said it was timed to give fans a chance to get comfortable with Web3 technology ahead of the group's 2023 tour, when the NFT holders can use their Deathbats for early access to tickets.
