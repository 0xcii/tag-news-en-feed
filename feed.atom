        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With his recent audacious estimate that Bitcoin may surge to $265,000 if it keeps a price over $45,000, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has offered some relief to investors who may already be feeling there’s not much room for the crypto to grow.
 
 
The study of BTC’s market basics, especially its hashrate to market cap ratio, which points to significant development potential for the top cryptocurrency, helps one to have this hopeful view.
 
Bitcoin: Current Landscape
 
Bitcoin is now trading just a little under $57,000 and has slightly retreated over 1% in the last 24 hours. Ju’s prognosis shows, in spite of these swings, that the network foundations of Bitcoin are better than ever.
 
 
As long as the #Bitcoin price stays above $45K, it could break its all-time high again within a year, imo.

        <updated>2024-08-07T17:21:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent Bloomberg interview, Michael Saylor, executive chairman and co-founder of MicroStrategy, revealed that beyond his company's holdings, he personally owns at least 17,732 Bitcoin, currently valued at approximately $1 billion. Saylor emphasized his commitment to Bitcoin, stating, "I haven't sold any bitcoin, I continue to acquire more bitcoin. It's a great capital investment asset for an individual, a family, an institution, a corporation, or a country. And I can't see a better place to put my money."

#Bitcoin is a capital investment you can hold for decades that a corporation, competitor, counterparty, or country can’t take away from you. It will create generational wealth for your family, corporation, or country. pic.twitter.com/amQNn4JQwR
— Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) August 7, 2024
  
  
  
Saylor described Bitcoin as "the apex property of the United States" in light of recent political developments. He highlighted U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis's proposed legislation to create a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which aims to accumulate up to 1 million BTC over time if enacted. Additionally, former President Donald Trump has pledged not to sell the nation's seized Bitcoin, famously advising at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville to "never sell your Bitcoin."

Saylor then went on to note the significant shift in political perspectives, stating, "I think that the conversation has shifted and every politician in the world has started to realize that Bitcoin is the most desirable property in cyberspace - it's the future."
Saylor concluded the interview by emphasizing the importance of holding Bitcoin as a long-term capital investment rather than spending it on frivolous things like coffee or ice cream, describing Bitcoin as "the most desirable property in the universe."]]></summary>

Best Time To Start Accumulating Ethereum
 
On August 7, crypto analyst, Alan Santana released a blog post on TradingView discussing the best time to start planning a bullish wave in Ethereum. With ETH now challenging critical support levels, it could lead to prices reverting to the “baseline,” a level that could indicate the right time to begin accumulating. 
 
 
Based on Santana’s analysis of ETH, the baseline represents a strong level, suggesting a potential for a bounce but also signaling possibilities of m…]]></summary>

What is a Donor-Advised Fund?
A donor-advised fund (DAF) is a highly flexible charitable giving tool that allows you to make a charitable contribution, receive an immediate tax deduction, and then recommend grants from the fund over time. Think of it as a “lily pad” that provides a strategic resting place for your charitable assets before they reach their final destination.
