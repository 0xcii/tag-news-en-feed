Economist Richard Werner, however, believes the timing of the Fednow rollout is “suspicious,” and he suggests that “maybe it’s all about rolling out” a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Bitcoin Transaction Count Has Observed A Sharp Increase Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the BTC blockchain activity has significantly gone up recently. The indicator of interest here is the “transaction count,” which measures the total number of Bitcoin transactions taking place on the network right now.
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means the chain is seeing a high amount of usage from the holders. This kind of trend suggests traders are active in the market right now.
 
On the other hand, low values of the indicator suggest the BTC blockchain is seeing low activity currently. Such a trend can b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xrp moved to its highest point since November, as markets reacted to news suggesting a verdict could be near in Ripple’s case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Cardano was also higher on Wednesday, hitting a one-month high.
 
XRP
 
XRP rose to its highest point since November, as markets continued to react to the latest news surrounding Ripple’s case with the SEC.
 
Following a low of $0.4199 on Tuesday, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4914 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the strongest point that the token has reached since November 6, when prices were retreating from a high above $0.50.
 
 
Overall, earlier gains have since eased, which comes as bulls failed to sustain a breakout on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 65.14, which is below the aforementioned ceiling at 70.00.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average remains in an uptrend despite the marginal decline, which sees XRP currently trading at $0.4459.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was once again higher in today’s session, as the token jumped to a one-month high.
 
ADA/USD moved to a peak of $0.387 on Wednesday, which comes a day after falling to a low at $0.349.
 
Today’s surge saw bulls push cardano to its highest level since February 23, when price was at a peak of $0.393.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that the climb coincided with the 10-day (red) moving average crossing over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the 14-day RSI is now tracking at 60.93, which is its highest reading since mid-February.
 
A ceiling at 53.00 may await for bulls should momentum continue in this current direction, which could put a stop to the run.

Ted Cruz Introduces CBDC Bill
 
This is not the first time Senator Cruz has attempted to block CBDCs. He previously introduced similar legislation in 2022 but failed to gain traction in Congress. However, with the increasing interest in CBDCs from central banks worldwide, including the Federal Reserve, Senator Cruz is renewing his efforts to prevent their implementation in the U.S.
