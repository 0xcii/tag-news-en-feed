This is because the coin is rallying at a time when uncertainty is the order of the day as crypto investors await the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision on Spot Bitcoin ETFs. So far, the TIA coin has been able to rise to new all-time highs, reaching almost 800% from its 2023 lows.
 
Celestia Stakers Reaping The Rewards
 
The major reason that the Celestia token has been seeing a lot of interest lately is the multiple airdrops that are being given to TIA stakers. These stakers have been rewarded for committing their tokens to the network to help secure it and multiple projects have confirmed airdrops.
