        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, the BRC20 token, dubbed ordinals (ORDI), soared over 40% against the U.S. dollar, fueled by news from Binance about its impending inclusion on the exchange’s roster of traded currencies. ORDI rocketed from an early 24-hour low of $7 to a peak of $11.53, settling at $10.48 per token at the time of this report.
 
Binance Listing Catapults ORDI Token
 
The announcement from Binance, the leading global crypto exchange, to usher ORDI onto its platform gave the token a significant boost. ORDI isn’t new to the spotlight, having been previously embraced by other major exchanges like Okx. Yet, it was the nod from Binance that sent ORDI soaring past the $11 mark in the morning’s Eastern Time trading flurry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kazakhstan blocked access to cryptocurrency exchange  
Coinbase’s website for alleged violations of the country’s laws on digital  
assets. The officials from Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Culture and Information confirmed  
the restriction today (Tuesday), according to the local media outlet, Kursiv. 
This decision followed the government's enforcement  
of the Law on Digital Assets, which became effective in February 2023. The  
regulation aims to restrict the issuance and trading of digital currencies and  
crypto exchange activities without a national license. 
The move is part of Kazakhstan's broader strategy to  
establish more stringent regulations in the cryptocurrency sector, impacting  
not only Coinbase but other major international crypto exchanges as well.

For the first time since late July, XRP reached a three-month high of $0.73, as reported by CoinGecko. Currently, XRP’s value stands at approximately $0.692314, marking a 2.8% increase over the past 24 hours, while its seven-day rally has accumulated gains of 20.9%.
 
Data analysis suggests that XRP’s recent gains were primarily driven by spot trading activity. Liquidations of XRP-tracked futures contracts surpassed the $4.4 million mark, indicating a notable uptick in trading volume.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears X, Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and xAI won't be issuing their own cryptocurrency anytime soon.
Announced on X late last week, Elon Musk has declared that none of his companies will be launching a cryptocurrency token, in a move that underscores a shift in the tech industry's attitude toward competing with Bitcoin as a digital currency. 
This announcement is particularly noteworthy in light of X (formerly Twitter), which recently announced its intention to transform into a platform for financial services. Previously, there had been speculation that Musk might integrate Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency he has vocally supported in the past, into his companies' operations.
Under the leadership of Jack Dorsey, Twitter was known for its pro-Bitcoin stance, actively incorporating new features like Bitcoin tipping, a feature that has attracted him to the upstart social network, Nostr. However, Elon Musk has seemed to walk back that support, creating questions about his intentions.
Musk's decision not to launch a crypto token carries significance, as it suggests that the concept of issuing worthless cryptocurrencies is losing favor among prominent Silicon Valley tech leaders. 
This shift in sentiment could be attributed to the increasing regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency industry, or simply the failures over the last decade for any crypto token to differentiate from Bitcoin. 
With Musk's reputation as a tech visionary and influencer, his statement may influence other tech leaders and entrepreneurs, to put the idea to rest as well.]]></summary>

Inves Capital’s managing director said “crypto is entering a new phase” of growth and ZARP is set to “play a central role.”
 
‘Substantial Liquidity’ to Be Injected Into the ZARP Network
 
South African financial services giant Old Mutual Wealth and Inves Capital recently revealed their plan to financially back the zarp stablecoin project. In addition, the two organizations reportedly pledged to promote its use in decentralized finance (defi) protocols.
 
According to a Globalcrypto TV report, the planned injection of “substantial” of liquidity into the ZARP network would broaden Old Mutual Wealth’s relationship with the stablecoin project. As previously reported by Bitcoin.com News, the financial services giant has been the manager of the stablecoin project’s cash reserves since Sept. 2022.
 

 
Commenting on the two companies’ decision to enhance support for the stablecoin, Simon Dingle, the managing director Inves Capital, said:
 
“We are now extending our relationship to explore new frontiers in decentralised finance and provide deep liquidity to emerging capital markets. Crypto is entering a new phase of growth and ZARP is braced to play a central role in representing rand value in these exciting new protocols.”
 
Dingle, who also manages the stablecoin, suggested that South Africa’s decision to designate crypto assets as a financial product may have played a part in convincing Old Mutual and his firm.
 
Farhad Sader, the managing director of Old Mutual, said seeing “the potential application of the technology first-hand” made the decision to honor its pledge to extend its partnership with the stablecoin project easier.

Gold’s enduring stability, in contrast to depreciating fiat currencies, has made it a trusted wealth preserver for centuries. Following the US President’s 1971 decision to abandon the gold standard, major fiat currencies have suffered substantial devaluation, with the dollar losing as much as 97% of its value against gold.
 
As inflation rates rise, interest in alternative assets such as gold and cryptocurrencies has surged. While cryptocurrencies are volatile, gold remains a stable and reliable refuge in times of crisis, hyperinflation, conflict, or natural d…]]></summary>
