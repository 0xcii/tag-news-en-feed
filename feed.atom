Dogecoin Whale Go On Buying Spree
 
According to Whale Alert, an on-chain data tracking platform for large crypto transactions, there have been a number of curious transactions carried out by new Dogecoin whales. The first of these transactions was carried out by a wallet that had received 515 million DOGE on February 16, worth approximately $44 million at the time.  This wallet had not had any prior transactions before this and was a brand new wallet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reddit, the popular social media platform, has disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that it has invested a portion of its excess cash reserves into Bitcoin. The social media giant revealed this today as they have applied to go public and list their Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “RDDT” with this filing.

BREAKING: Reddit invested excess cash reserves into #Bitcoin — SEC filing pic.twitter.com/13IWr3QFvH
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) February 22, 2024
  
  
  
"We invested some of our excess cash reserves in Bitcoin and Ether and also acquired Ether and Matic as a form of payment for sales of certain virtual goods, which we may continue to do in the future," the filing stated. "Our investments in cryptocurrencies for treasury purposes are limited to Bitcoin, Ether, and any other cryptocurrency that the SEC, Commodities Futures Trading Commission, or high-ranking members of the staff of such regulatory bodies may, through public statements or guidance, identify as likely not being a security."
The decision to allocate funds into Bitcoin reflects Reddit's confidence in the long-term potential of Bitcoin despite its short-term volatility. By investing in Bitcoin, Reddit joins a growing list of companies that have added BTC to their balance sheets as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation.
Reddit's move also signals a broader trend of institutional adoption of Bitcoin, as more companies recognize the value proposition of BTC in today's evolving financial landscape. While Reddit did not disclose the specific amount of Bitcoin it has purchased, the decision to invest in Bitcoin underscores its belief in the resilience and potential of BTC as a store of value and investment vehicle.]]></summary>

Algorithm Expects Shiba Inu Price To Retrace
 
The CoinCodex machine learning algorithm takes into account a number of factors and uses this to come up with a prediction for the price of a cryptocurrency. For Shiba Inu, the prediction for the next five days is more bearish than expected.
 
 
Although the Shiba Inu price is currently trading above the $0.000009 level, the machine learning algorithm expects this to be short-lived. The 5-day prediction came out to be $0.0000089,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest publicly traded bitcoin miner by market capitalization, has launched Slipstream, a service for individuals to easily submit complex and non-standard transactions to the Bitcoin network. Slipstream is the first instance of a public bitcoin mining company facilitating direct transaction submission services, made possible by the fact that Marathon operates its own proprietary mining pool, Mara Pool.
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, non-standard Bitcoin transactions are often excluded from submission to Bitcoin nodes’ mempools despite their adherence to consensus parameters. These transactions, such as those associated with Ordinals and inscriptions, were already possible, but Slipstream aims to facilitate this process with a user-friendly and formalized process for direct submission.

Marathon CEO Fred Thiel: “While direct transaction submission services exist, most are rudimentary. Slipstream provides sophisticated users with a simple, transparent, and trusted means of adding complex Bitcoin transactions to the blockchain, provided they adhere to Bitcoin’s protocol.”
Thiel also noted the importance of this venture to support innovation and experimentation on Bitcoin: “We believe Slipstream is mutually beneficial for the industry and for our organization, and we look forward to building on this announcement to further assist those who are building on Bitcoin.”]]></summary>

There are many different ways to approach holding bitcoin in an IRA, and as with everything in bitcoin, each has its trade-offs. Let’s look at how the many different bitcoin IRA approaches compare.
Sovereignty and appreciation
Before we can cover these approaches to bitcoin retirement savings, you have to understand the two most important benefits you receive by holding bitcoin: financial sovereignty and purchasing power. That is, the freedom you gain from holding the private keys to a digital bearer asset that exists outside the traditional financial system, and the appreciation of that asset as measured in fiat term…]]></summary>
