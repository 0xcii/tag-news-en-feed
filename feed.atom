Enough people are now paying attention to Ripple’s cryptocurrency, that it’s starting to pull capital from Bitcoin and Ethereum. And according to the charts of the three assets, XRP is poised to wildly outperform the two more dominant coins.
 
XRP To Outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum After 6 Years Of Lagging
 
Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which enjoyed record-setting new highs in 2020 and 2021, XRP has yet to reach beyond its 2017 peak.
 
That’s because in 2020 the United States Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Ripple and two of its top executives with a lawsuit alleging the sale of unregistered securities.
