In fact, the name ‘dodo’ likely originated from the Portuguese word, ‘simpleton’. The dodo bird lived very comfortably for much of its existence on an isolated island that lacked any natural predators. Over time the dodo bird grew bigger, and its wings grew smaller. Growing larger while having no predators emboldened the mighty dodo bird to become increasingly fearless. 
And then humans showed up. And everything changed. Instantly. 
The rapid and dramatic environmental changes left the dodo bird helpless. Because it was flightless, it couldn’t escape. It needed wings to survive but evolutionary processes don’t occur overnight, they take thousands of years. From happy, fat, and thriving to extinction. In the blink of an e…]]></summary>

Bitcoiners were craving something they could hang onto in the middle of the bear.

Unfortunately, life had other plans and, to make a long story short, I quickly realized I bit off more than I could chew at the time. 
The Bitcoin Script Project never saw the light of the day. At best, it was a short-lived social awareness campaign. It seeded some ideas and moved the conversation forward.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto.com has reached a new milestone by surpassing 100 million global users, marking a significant achievement for the company since its inception in 2016. The cryptocurrency exchange attributes this achievement to its latest marketing campaign, which included partnerships with  
renowned personalities, venues, and events.
Partnerships Propel Crypto.com
Some of the marketing efforts include hosting NBA and  
NHL Playoffs at the Crypto.com Arena and the Formula 1 Crypto.com Miami Grand  
Prix. Additionally, the firm recently released the brand film  
"INEVITABLE," under the campaign "Fortune Favors the  
Brave." 
Kris Marszlek, the CEO of Crypto.com, mentioned:  
"Positioning our brand through engaging campaigns and iconic partnerships  
has made Crypto.com a household name. But I'm most proud of the fact that we've  
surpassed the 100 million user milestone while building the most widely  
regulated platform in the industry by leading in global licenses and  
registrations."
In May, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority  
(VARA) licensed Crypto.com for full operation in institutional crypto trading.  
The exchange regional arm, CRO DAX Middle East FZE, was granted a Virtual Asset  
Service Provider license in 2023. 
Crypto.com Exchange, designed for both institutional  
and qualified retail investors, offers a suite of services, including spot  
trading, staking brokerage, and over-the-counter offerings. With plans to roll  
out the Crypto.com app and other products for retail investors in the region,  
Crypto.com aims to strengthen its position in the global cryptocurrency market.
Global Expansion Initiatives
Beyond Dubai, Crypto.com is expanding its presence  
globally. This includes the recent announcement of a specialized trading  
platform for Korean users.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

Cartier, a direct descendant of Louis Cartier, founder of the iconic luxury brand, appears to have strayed far from the family’s reputable business. Prosecutors allege he conspired with a Colombian drug cartel, attempting to launder hundreds of millions of dollars in drug proceeds. Their scheme reportedly involved converting the illicit funds into Tether (USDT), a controversial cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar.
