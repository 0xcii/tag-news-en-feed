        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A tweet by Michael Saylor, calling Bitcoin a “20% off,” went viral. MicroStrategy co-founder and chairman Saylor has been vocal about Bitcoin. The newest missive occurred during the crypto’s most turbulent price.
 
 
At the moment, BTC changes hands at about $60,550 and has thus far failed to close above $61,000. Perhaps this is the cause of mixed feelings among investors.
 
Saylor’s Message And Its Interpretation
 
In a post, Saylor tweeted a rather interesting photograph of an old signpost with the words, “For Sale, 1 BTC,” and captioned it, “Bitcoin: 20% off. Sale ends soon.”

Kelleher mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the SEC has a 90% chance of winning on appeal in its long-running legal battle against Ripple.

For the general public, who are genuinely concerned about environmental preservation but lack in-depth knowledge of Bitcoin mining, these narratives are alarming. As a relatively young and seemingly complex industry, much of this misleading negative publicity sticks, while the significant societal benefits of Bitcoin mining are often ignored.
