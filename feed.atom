He conveyed that this significant alignment with the five major emerging economies could potentially unlock unprecedented economic prospects for all the nations. 
 
Algeria Sets Sights on BRICS
 
In anticipation of the forthcoming BRICS Summit, there might be less emphasis on the oft-debated BRICS reserve currency, yet over 40 nations exhibit a keen interest in becoming part of this influential bloc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to data from Dune Analytics on July 24, the amount of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), a synthetic form of Bitcoin, circulating on Ethereum has fallen by 44% since May 2022. In July 2023, wBTC circulating on Ethereum stood at approximately 158,000 BTC, a sharp decline from 282,000 BTC recorded in May 2022. 
 
Interestingly, on-chain records also showed that the amount of wBTC minted and circulated in Ethereum, primarily for decentralized finance (DeFi) purposes, continued to rise in the first five months of 2022. It peaked in May 2022 amid a market-wide contraction of crypto prices that saw Bitcoin cool off from 2021 peaks of over $69,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, US Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was announced as a speaker at the upcoming Mining Disrupt 2023, a highly anticipated event in the Bitcoin mining community, taking place in Miami on July 25-27th at the Miami Airport Convention Center.



Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also spoke at the Bitcoin 2023 conference earlier this year in Miami. Since then, the presidential candidate has only increased his devotion to Bitcoin, announcing that if elected president he would back the US dollar with BTC, and also eliminate capital gains taxes on bitcoin to dollar conversions.



Mining Disrupt will also feature a strong lineup of keynotes and discussion panels, starring expert speakers in the Bitcoin mining space, allowing attendees to learn more about and stay updated on the latest products, strategies, and tendencies in the mining industry. The event organizers expect around 5,000 attendees at this year's conference, making it one of the larger Bitcoin conferences of the year.
Michael Cruz, Mining Disrupt founder and co-owner, reflected on how far the conference has come in the last few years: “What started as the Mining Disrupt telegram group for miners over 6 years ago, turned in to our first official trade show in 2019, and now, we are thrilled to be celebrating our 5th year anniversary. What an amazing ride! We are very thankful for all the support.”
Gabriel Rodriguez, co-owner of Mining Disrupt, emphasizes the essence of the event as a true B2B Expo and conference, uniting leading companies in Bitcoin mining from around the globe under one roof. With over 100 sponsors and exhibitors, their shared goals revolve around building trust and fostering the growth of the young mining industry.
