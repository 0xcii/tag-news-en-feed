        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has unveiled a new regulatory framework for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The guidelines, issued ahead of the upcoming Virtual Asset User Protection Act taking effect on July 19th, 2024, aim to bring clarity and structure to the burgeoning NFT market while safeguarding investors and fostering responsible innovation.
 
 
Fungibility Takes Center Stage
 
The core of the FSC’s approach hinges on the concept of fungibility – an NFT’s ability to be exchanged for another identical NFT. NFTs that are mass-produced, divisible, and function primarily as a means of payment will be classified as virtual assets and subject to regulations similar to cryptocurrencies.

Hayden Adams Declares Demise Of Ethereum Gas Fees
 
During the weekend, Hayden Adams, the inventor of Uniswap, one of the largest Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), took to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to share his thoughts on Ethereum’s gas fees.

Hoskinson’s Vision Realized
 
Cardano’s development has been a marathon, not a sprint, meticulously guided by Charles Hoskinson’s vision. Unlike some blockchain projects that prioritize rapid innovation, Cardano emphasizes rigorous testing and peer-reviewed research.
