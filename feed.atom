        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has declared on their website that VanEck, Fidelity, and ARK 21Shares Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) will officially commence trading starting tomorrow. 
 
         
         
         
         
    
The CBOE's announcement signifies a major milestone in the quest for regulated and direct exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs, allowing both institutional and retail investors a pathway to Bitcoin exposure.
This development follows meticulous regulatory evaluations and market preparations, positioning the Spot Bitcoin ETFs for an eagerly awaited debut on the trading floor. The CBOE's confirmation reinforces the growing acceptance and recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate and regulated investment asset class.
The imminent commencement of trading for Spot Bitcoin ETFs underlines a historic moment poised to reshape the investment landscape, providing broader access to Bitcoin within traditional financial markets. However it is important to note, at the time of writing, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to officially approve the ETFs for trading, which approvals are expected later today.]]></summary>

Since that time, nostr has gradually become more user friendly and an increasingly meaningful part of my life. I have now deleted all other social media accounts in favor of this blossoming decentralized alternative. My slow exodus away from centralized social media started over ten years ago, but the formation of a functional substitute was the final nail in the coffin. Making the jump at such an early stage may have been premature, but after two months using both nostr and Twitter I chose to make the transition permanent. I’ve written this article to explain my reasoning and provide an assessment of the nostr network …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the veteran trader Peter Brandt, the current bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) hype which has seen the “average guy on the street” clamoring to get in may be a signal to experienced traders that it is time to sell them what they own. Brandt also characterized the expected approval of spot bitcoin ETFs as a “classic buy the rumor, sell the news event.”
 
Brandt Questions Maximalists’ Commitment to the Values of Bitcoin
 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes the expected approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) to be a “classic buy the rumor, sell the news event.” Brandt explained that this conclusion is based in part on how the so-called bitcoin maximalists are eagerly awaiting the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs and his years of experience as a pro trader.

This episode underscores the intense anticipation surrounding the potential greenlighting of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a decision expected in the coming days.
 
While some see this as a historic step towards mainstream acceptance, others, like outspoken Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff, warn of a potential “buy the rumor, sell the news” scenario.
 
 
Schiff argues that the market has already baked in the excitement, creating an “overbought” condition ripe for correction. He advises investors to exercise caution and consider selling before the actual decision lands.
