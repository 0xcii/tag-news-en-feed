        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a groundbreaking experiment, Mario Havel, a protocol supporter and researcher of the Ethereum (ETH) Foundation, has achieved the synchronization of an ETH node on an unlikely device – a PlayStation 4 gaming console. 
 
According to a recent post, Havel’s journey began with delving into “PlayStation jailbreaking,” where he discovered vulnerabilities in older PlayStation 4 firmware that allowed for control takeover. 
 
Jailbreaking refers to bypassing the restrictions imposed by the official software (firmware) of a device, in this case, a PlayStation 4 console.

The haul includes approximately 30,000 Ethereum (ETH) coins, valued at roughly $54 million at today’s price, all of which have been traced back to criminal undertakings and were seized by authorities.

Cost Of A 51% Attack On The Bitcoin Network Today
 
In a new post on X, analyst James V. Straten has provided an estimation for the cost of a 51% attack on the BTC blockchain. A “51% attack” in the context of Bitcoin is when a single group takes control of more than 50% of the hashrate on the network and thus, effectively gains hold of the blockchain as a whole.
 
The “hashrate” here refers to a measure of the total amount of computing power that the miners have connected to the BTC network right now. The metric is measured in terms of “Exahashes per second” (EH/s).
