        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin Argentina, an NGO focused on promoting Bitcoin, is offering a virtual training course called "Introduction to Lightning Network."
According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the course aims to educate participants on the operation and development possibilities of the Layer 2 solution that operates on top of the Bitcoin network. 
Jimena Vallone, the executive director of Bitcoin Argentina, stated, "With the Bitcoin Argentina NGO, we want to bring about knowledge about this technology and generate practical and theoretical spaces that allow professionals, specialists, users and interested parties to explore its uses and potential."
The course, starting on May 23, will be taught by prominent specialists in the field, including Nicolás Bourbon, Francisco Calderon, Federico Andragnes and members of Librería de Satoshi, Laura Medina and Gustavo Torres. The curriculum will cover introductory aspects of Bitcoin, the mining process, the structure and operation of the Lightning Network, the technological implications for network growth, digital wallets, transactions and fraud prevention.
Bitcoin Argentina has previously organized the Lightning Hackday in Buenos Aires, which received a positive response from participants. Vallone expressed the organization's motivation behind the training course, saying, "We want to provide the necessary tools so that more and more people can learn about the potential of decentralized technologies and the financial innovation that began with Bitcoin in 2009."
Interested individuals can register for the course directly or via the NGO's website, with limited spots available. Participants will receive a certificate of attendance upon completion of the program.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-05-15T20:39:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Midway through May and bitcoin has mostly fallen lower, as markets digested several key pieces of economic data. The headline was another rate hike by the Federal Reserve, which came as U.S. non-farm payrolls rose marginally higher than expected. Heading into the last fortnight of the month, could bulls be on the brink of returning?
 
Current Market Status
 
At the halfway point of May, bitcoin has fallen to a two-month low, as market sentiment shifted bearish, following April’s strong gains.
 
With several key data points all being released in a short window, it was somewhat expected that price uncertainty would be present.
 
The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points, days after non-farm payrolls rose to 253,000, versus expectations of 180,000.
 
Since then, inflation fell to 4.9% in April, with many still uncertain as to what the Federal Reserve will do during June’s meeting.
 
 
May Outlook
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a low of $25,810 last Friday, which came after a breakout occurred at a key price floor of $26,500.
 
This move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency plunge to its weakest point since March 17, when the price was below $25,000.
 
Since then, BTC has somewhat rebounded, climbing to a peak of $27,527.51 earlier in today’s session.
 
 
From the chart, one of the catalysts for this move was the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which rose above a ceiling at 42.00.
 
The index is now tracking at 44.66, with bitcoin reentering its own support point at $27,500, with bulls seemingly targeting $28,000 in the near term.
 
A big test will be what happens when the RSI reaches a ceiling at 48.00, should it move beyond this, not only will BTC be above $28,000, however, there is a good chance that it could hit $30,000 before the month’s end.
 
Where will bitcoin end the month? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.]]></summary>

securities regulator has sought to drastically bring  
down the fine it asked the court to slam against  LBRY, a

startup’s native LBC tokens were unregistered securities.
The  
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) previously asked the court to fine  
LBRY $22 million for pooling $11 million from its unauthorized offering. However, in a

amount to $111,614, noting that it considered the firm’s argument that “it is  
defunct, ceasing operations, and without the funds to pay a larger fine.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana extended recent gains on Monday, as the token rose to a one-week high, following recent declines. The token dropped below the $20.00 level last week, as a red wave hit cryptocurrency markets. Litecoin was also higher today, climbing by nearly 7%.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rose to a one-week high on Monday, as momentum shifted following a recent bear run.
 
SOL/USD surged to a peak of $21.49 earlier in today’s session., which comes after Sunday’s low of $20.65.
 
As a result of this rally, solana moved to its strongest point since last Monday, when price was close to $22.00.
 
 
One of the catalysts of today’s gains came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 45.00.
 
The index is now tracking at 48.31, which is its highest reading in almost ten days of trading.
 
Should current sentiment extend throughout the week, there is a good chance SOL will near its long-term resistance at $24.00.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Additionally, litecoin (LTC) also moved higher in today’s session, with price climbing by as much as 7%.
 
Following a low of $81.75 on Sunday, LTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $87.54 earlier in the day.
 
This jump resulted in the token reaching its highest point since March 6, which is the last time LTC was trading close to the $90.00 mark.
 
 
From the chart, a breakout of the RSI has also occurred here, with a ceiling at 51.00 being broken.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is now at the 54.15 mark, with the next visible point of resistance being 58.00.
 
There is a strong possibility that litecoin could move above $90.00 in the coming days.
