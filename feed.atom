        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Bitcoin drops, liquidating leveraged long bets along the way, one analyst, in a post on X, thinks this might be a prime opportunity to accumulate, citing historical patterns of pullbacks followed by impressive recoveries. 
 
Time To Load The Bitcoin Dip?
 
The analyst shared a chart indicating that Bitcoin is within historical retracement ranges. Whenever this happens, prices tend to bounce back sharply, tearing higher, much to the relief of holders.
 
 
 
 
Solid data back this assessment. The analyst said that since Bitcoin bottomed at $15,500 in 2022, there have been four distinct pullbacks, all within the -20% to -23% range. For the savvy, the trader continued, each of these downturns presented an opportunity to accumulate at a discount.
