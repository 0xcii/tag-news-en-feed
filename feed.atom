        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FTX verdict is out. US District Judge Peter Castel approved a $12.7 billion deal that requires the failed exchange FTX and its sister trade company, Alameda Research, to pay their debts.
 
 
On August 7, 2024, a verdict was issued that concludes a protracted legal dispute with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which originated after FTX’s sudden decline in late 2022.
 
The deal represents a significant stride in addressing the financial issues stemming from one of the biggest corporate disasters in the history of crypto.
 
With $8.7 billion reserved especially for investors misled by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, the proposed settlement calls for the whole $12.7 billion to be distributed to repaying FTX creditors.

This figure is directly tied to Taiwan’s gold reserves, which are significantly higher relative to those of the United Kingdom.
 
Is Taiwan Next To Adopt Bitcoin?
 
Samson Mow’s advocacy for Bitcoin comes from his extensive experience in pushing for its adoption at a national level, as seen through his previous involvement in El Salvador‘s Bitcoin initiatives. According to Mow, adopting BTC could yield similar economic benefits for Taiwan, including boosts in tourism, GDP, employment, and foreign investment. “The nation-state playbook is there to be c…]]></summary>
