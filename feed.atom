        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of refinement, Ethereum, the world’s largest smart contracts platform, is scaling. However, it does not scale in the way most decentralization purists desire. The network, trying to accommodate all its users, now relies mainly on off-chain solutions using roll-up techniques to process more transactions and relieve the mainnet.
 
The Ethereum Layer-2 Boom
 
The result has seen a boom with layer-2 platforms. According to L2Beat, all these off-chain solutions scaling Ethereum manage over $37 billion worth of assets. The largest of them all is Arbitrum, which controls more than $13 billion.
 
 
Despite the boom, the question of decentralization still lingers. Arbitrum, Base, and other layer-2s on Ethereum might be gaining traction, but most have yet to decentralize.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates in September, Bitcoin has been volatile yet predominantly bullish. Analysts and investors are now waiting patiently for the next leg up, as BTC recently stopped at the $69,400 mark and is finding strong support around $66,000. This level is key, as it could determine Bitcoin’s next price movement.
 
 
Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that the Bitcoin Average Profitability Index is currently at 202%, indicating that the price is roughly twice the realized price. This metric provides confidence to investors and traders who expect Bitcoin to continue rising. 
 
With profitability still well below levels that typically trigger mass profit-taking, it suggests more room for BTC to grow before significant selling pressure emerges.

MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor is now at the center of strong criticisms after saying that it would be better for Bitcoin to be in the custody of “too big to fail” banks than self-custody.
 
 
The Contentious Remark
 
Saylor, in a podcast interview, dissuaded investors and traders from the Bitcoin self-custody approach while putting forward the idea of custodianship through large financial institutions like banks.
 
He believes that large and established financial institutions can better serve Bitcoin holders because they are designed to secure financial assets.
