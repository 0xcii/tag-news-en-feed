        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, has raised significant concerns about the long-term sustainability of the burgeoning layer-2 chains that are primarily integrated within the Ethereum ecosystem.
 
Yakovenko, a visionary in the blockchain domain, suggests that these solutions might inadvertently hinder scalability and user experience, attributing it to the complexity brought about by fragmentation.
 
Layer-2 chains, often referred to as second-layer solutions, are a class of blockchain scalability solutions designed to enhance the efficiency and throughput of blockchain networks.
 
These chains operate atop existing layer 1 blockchains (like Ethereum) and aim to mitigate congestion and high fees by processing and verifying transactions off the main chain while maintaining its securit…]]></summary>

the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance's entities has decided

According to a report by

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto has come a long way over the past decade, and if you had to define where in its history we are right now, one possible answer would be that we’ve entered a validation phase. By which, what’s meant is that major names from traditional finance and fintech are not only acknowledging the value of crypto but are actively moving to incorporate it into their products and portfolios.
 This was apparent when BlackRock (along with several competitors) filed with the SEC to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF, with CEO Larry Fink last month publicly stating, “If we can create more tokenization of assets and securities–that’s what bitcoin is–it could revolutionize finance,” while he also spoke of crypto as “digitizing gold,” statements that would have been unthinkable not so long ago (Fink described Bitc…]]></summary>

Shibarium’s Launch
 
Shibarium officially launched on August 16, following so much hype around the network. And despite joining an already saturated layer-2 space, the Ethereum layer-2 network was set to position itself as a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. 
 
Shibarium’s launch was highly significant for the Shiba Inu community as the network employs SHIB as its ecosystem token, which would undoubtedly increase the meme token’s value as activity on the network increases.

The Australian Financial Crimes Exchange said as much as 47% of all fraud and financial scam proceeds in the country are washed on crypto exchange platforms. 
 
Crypto a ‘Getaway Vehicle for Scam Money’
 
According to Anna Bligh, the CEO of the Australian Banking Association (ABA), an “alarming” portion of scam money often gets laundered via cryptocurrency exchange platforms. The CEO added that Australian authorities must also do more to “ensure cryptocurrency is not used as the getaway vehicle for scam money.” This would be in addition to stopping scams from reaching Australians via mobile phones, emails and social media, a report said.

This will allow Ledger Live users to buy bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH), and litecoin (LTC) within the app using Paypal.
 
Ledger Enables Paypal Payments for US Customers to Streamline Crypto Purchases Within App
 
On Wednesday, Ledger revealed Ledger Live users can now purchase BTC, ETH, BCH, and LTC using Paypal. The company believes this offers a “convenient, simple and secure way” to buy digital currencies through its companion application. Users can select Paypal as their payment method in the app’s “buy” section.
 
However, this is available only to users who have previously used Paypal to buy crypto assets. Ledger Live users new to Paypal for crypto “will be required to create a Paypal account or undergo a KYC verification,” according to Ledger. The company directed users to its Help Center for guidance on using Paypal for digital currency purchases.
 
“Both Paypal and Ledger are focused on creating secure, seamless, and fast transactions no matter where you are in the world. Paypal has remained at the forefront of the digital payment revolution for more than 20 years, and we are thrilled to come together in this next period of asset innovation with our integration,” said Pascal Gauthier, Ledger’s chairman and CEO.
 
 
This development comes after Paypal introduced its own stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar, named PYUSD. Though announced, PYUSD hasn’t yet been made available to the general public. Over the past two years, Paypal expanded its crypto services. However, this week, the payment giant paused crypto purchases in the U.K., citing regulatory shifts. The company stated that crypto buying in the United Kingdom would resume in early 2024.
