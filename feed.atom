        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple, a leading blockchain and cryptocurrency company, has acquired Fortress Trust, a Nevada-licensed financial services provider for the crypto industry. The purchase expands Ripple’s regulatory licenses and infrastructure to bolster its position in enterprise blockchain solutions.
 
Ripple Acquires Fortress Trust
 
The acquisition provides Ripple with Fortress Trust’s financial, regulatory, and technological infrastructure to serve the growing enterprise cryptocurrency market. “We’re excited to bring on this team and its technology to accelerate our business,” said Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO.
 
With the purchase, Ripple gains Fortress Trust’s Nevada trust license, adding to Ripple’s existing licenses and approvals. Fortress was launched in 2021 by Scott Purcell, former CEO of the now-defunct crypto custodian Prime Trust.
 
Three years after Purcell’s departure, Prime Trust entered receivership when a proposed acquisition fell through. The company was then shut down by regulators and filed for bankruptcy after losing control of significant customer funds.
 
 
Known primarily for cross-border payments, Ripple has expanded into areas like liquidity and tokenization. The company says the purchase will improve experiences for existing products and allow exploration of new offerings. The deal is pending due diligence and approvals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two years have passed since El Salvador made history by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. In that short span, the nation has undergone remarkable changes and improvements. While some might consider it a mere coincidence, the most plausible explanation lies in the profound transformations initiated by the country, with Bitcoin at the heart of its rebranding and a notable shift in attitude among its citizens. This article explores the impact of Bitcoin's legal tender status on El Salvador's development, the challenges it has faced, and the broader implications of this groundbreaking decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recently filed court document, blockchain-based publishing company LBRY has signaled its intent to challenge a New Hampshire district court’s verdict. This ruling, made in November 2022, concurred with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stating that LBRY presented its digital assets as securities or investment contracts.
 
Unregistered Crypto Securities Saga: LBRY Challenges SEC Amid Wider Crypto Scrutiny
 
The LBRY project has lodged its intention to contest U.S. district judge Paul Barbadoro’s ruling, which determined LBRY peddled unregistered securities. On November 7, 2022, the court greenlit the SEC’s summary judgment request, deeming LBRY, Inc. in breach of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.
 
After the verdict, LBRY faced a fine of $111,614 and was “permanently restrained” from any security offerings based in the United States. The blockchain project stood as the first crypto venture to square off with the SEC in such a case.
 
Subsequently, the U.S. securities watchdog has launched a plethora of enforcement actions, tagging numerous crypto assets as “unregistered securities.”
 
 
Currently, these alleged crypto securities boast a combined valuation surpassing $78 billion. Amid the extensive list spotlighted by the SEC, LBRY is the 36th largest by market capitalization.
 
Timothy McLaughlin from the law firm Shaheen & Gordon submitted LBRY’s intention to appeal. On the social media network X (previously known as Twitter), LBRY announced it had “filed a Notice of Appeal against the SEC.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cronos rose for a second consecutive session, as the token continued to move away from a recent three-month low. Volatility in the marketplace was high on Friday, after several days of price consolidation. Stellar also surged, moving to a three-day high.
 
Cronos (CRO)
 
Cronos (CRO) continued to move away from a recent three-month low on Friday, after rising for a second straight session.
 
After trading at a bottom of $0.05072 on Thursday, CRO/USD surged to a peak of $0.05291 earlier in the day.
 
This moves comes as cronos bulls managed to avoid a full breakout below a support point at $0.0495.
 
 
One reason for this was the stability of the support point of 34.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 49.60, with the next point of resistance around 52.00.
 
In the event that price strength climbs beyond this point, CRO will most likely be trading around $0.05500.
 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
Stellar (XLM) rose to a three-day high in today’s session, as bulls continued to target a key price ceiling.
 
XLM/USD hit a high of $0.1271 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at $0.122.
 
The move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average approaches an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
This is the closest that traders of stellar have come to taking price over a resistance zone of $0.1300 since Tuesday.
 
Today’s surge came as the 14-day RSI broke free of a ceiling at 49.00, moving to a current level of 51.08 in the process.
 
Despite this, earlier gains have marginally eased, with XLM now trading at $0.1253.

The nation aims to capture a staggering 7% of the global Bitcoin hash rate by June 2025. This is not just a lofty goal; it’s backed by data presented by Bitcoin mining expert Jaran Mellerud in his latest report.
 
Oman, traditionally an oil-centric economy, is located on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. It shares borders with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Historically, Oman has been the 6th largest oil producer per capita globally. However, the winds of change are blowing, and Oman is shifting its focus to Bitcoin mining.

The decline comes after price collided with a key resistance point. Ethereum has also slipped, after moving closer to $1,700.
 
Bitcoin
 
Volatility was back in cryptocurrency markets on Friday, as bitcoin (BTC) bulls pushed price above the $26,000 level.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $26,414.01 earlier in today’s session, however this was short lived, as price now sits at $25,795.12.
 
Today’s move was the highest BTC has hit since last Thursday, and came following a breakout of a ceiling at $26,400.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Looking at the chart, previous bulls seem to have immediately liquidated their positions after price moved beyond this point.
 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) also hit a resistance level of its own at 45.00, before retreating to a current reading at 39.18.
 
Overall, this drop shows that market sentiment remains bearish, despite the slight spark seen earlier in the day.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also edged higher during Friday’s session, with bulls pushing price closer to the $1,700 level.
 
After trading at a low of $1,617.80 on Thursday, ETH/USD rallied to an intraday high of $1,657.30 earlier in the day.
 
Similar to bitcoin above, gains have since faded, with the world’s second largest cryptocurrency now trading at $1,626.05.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
A failed move beyond a resistance zone of 40.00 seems to be one reason for the reversal, with the RSI now tracking at 37.41.
 
Should momentum continue to slip, a floor of 35.00 could provide a stable base, and if this fails, ETH could slip under $1,600.
