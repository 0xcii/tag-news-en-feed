In a July 23 tweet, Republican representative Warren Davidson condemned any potential move to launch a CBDC, noting that a digital currency flaws the ethos of money. Davidson urged Congress to ban and criminalize any effort to establish a central bank digital currency.
 
CBDC Is The Financial Equivalent Of Death Star, Says Congressman Davidson
 
 Warren Davidson, the Ohio 8th Congressional District representative, stressed that money should not be programmable by a central authority. According to him, the Federal Reserve’s move to develop a CBDC is like “building the financial equivalent of the Death Star.”

The thrust behind this trend is multifold, encompassing inflationary pressures, the global dominance of the U.S. dollar and the unique attributes of bitcoin.
