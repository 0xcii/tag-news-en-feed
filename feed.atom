Crypto Hacker Drains Millions From DeFi Protocol
 
On Tuesday, DeFi project Penpie, a Pendle-based independent yield optimizer, saw over $20 million in funds drained from the protocol.

JUST IN: 🇪🇺 Mastercard launches euro non-custodial #Bitcoin and crypto debit card. 
They have over 100 MILLION merchants 🚀 pic.twitter.com/xpASRDrhVx
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 5, 2024
  
  
  
The card enables European Bitcoin holders to spend from their self-hosted wallets at any of Mastercard's over 100 million merchants globally without needing to custody funds with an intermediary.
Mastercard is a payments titan serving nearly 1 billion customers in over 210 countries. This latest integration reflects the company's growing efforts to bridge Bitcoin with its sprawling traditional payments infrastructure.
"We are providing consumers who want to spend their digital assets with an easy, reliable, and secure way to do so, anywhere Mastercard is accepted," said Christian Rau, Senior Vice President of Mastercard's crypto unit.
The card allows spending Bitcoin and other crypto simply by connecting a non-custodial wallet. Users avoid selling Bitcoin and crypto on an exchange before spending, maintaining full ownership. However, Mastercard's card does have fees, including a €1.6 issuance fee, €1 monthly maintenance fee, and a 0.95% transaction fee. 
Nonetheless, by supporting non-custodial wallets, Mastercard addresses a major pain point and grants users the flexibility to directly control their Bitcoin and crypto. The move caters to a growing audience preferring self-hosted wallets over centralized exchanges.]]></summary>

Bitcoin Must Clear This Level For Bulls To Take Over
 
In a post on X, the analyst said the short-term trend will favor sellers unless there is a rapid shift in trend. If the bulls fail to soak in the deluge of selling pressure, prices will, in his forecast, continue tanking.
 
 
Technically, Bitcoin is within a bearish formation. Though there are occasional pockets of strength, buyers have failed to push prices higher, reclaiming $60,000, for example. 
 
In the medium term, the immediate support line will be $49,000 or August lows. On the upper end, buyers must build momentum and reclaim $72,000.
