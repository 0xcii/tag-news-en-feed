        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an analysis that could shift the narrative around the Bitcoin value proposition, crypto analyst TechDev has presented evidence suggesting that liquidity cycles, rather than the much-discussed Bitcoin halvings, are the primary catalyst for bull runs. Using a set of charts, TechDev offers a new perspective on Bitcoin’s price dynamics.
 
Is Bitcoin Halving Overrated?
 
In a recent post on X, TechDev asserts, “Still waiting on the halving? The ~3.5 year liquidity cycle has been running before Bitcoin existed.” The chart provided by TechDev illustrates a juxtaposition of Bitcoin’s price movements with a liquidity signal derived from major central bank balance sheets.
 
 
The striking feature in this chart is the series of sinusoidal lines that seem to predict pivot points in Bitcoin’s price …]]></summary>

The DeFi community nowadays is split between “yes” and “no” as an answer to this question after the resurgence of a six-year-old proposal. Since the controversy around sidechains involves advanced crypto language, let’s cover the basics first and then take a deeper look into the pros and cons of the proposal as well as any potential solutions. 
Before we delve into the specifics of BIP-300, it's worth mentioning that there are alternative approaches to expanding Bitcoin's utility that don't involve sidechains. One such approach is merged mining, which allows Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) to be shared with more chains at no extra cost. This is not only economically viable but also creates a symbiotic relationship with Bitcoin rather than comp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The use of stablecoins has recently come under increased scrutiny from the United States central bank. In a move to strengthen its supervision of banks involved in stablecoin activity, the Federal Reserve announced new guardrails in August. 
 
This heightened attention on stablecoins is driven by concerns that private entities are essentially creating private money, which could pose risks to the stability of the financial system. 
 
Michael Barr, vice chair of the Federal Reserve for Supervision, has called for a robust federal framework to regulate stablecoins. He emphasized the importance of well-regulating private money, especially those stablecoins that are linked to fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, as they inherently rely on the trust of the central bank.

        <updated>2023-11-08T16:59:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BTC Inc., through its Ordinals-focused division Rare BTC, has brokered the sale of inscription number 76 for 1.7 BTC, which is equivalent to approximately $61,000 at the time of sale.
The sale is indicative of the active interest and perceived value in the Ordinals space, with Rare BTC positioning itself as a key player in the market for these distinctive bitcoin-based digital artifacts and unique satoshis.
The bitcoin ecosystem saw Ordinals generate a craze earlier this year, between May and June, with trading volume nearing that seen on Ethereum NFTs and leading to a spike in bitcoin fees. After a somewhat dull summer, Ordinals activity is back and already nearing the highs seen in May. Notably, yesterday public Ordinals trading volume in the preceding 24 hours surpassed Ethereum NFT’s for the first time.
 
         
         
         
         
    
Rare BTC specializes in the sale of rare satoshis and Sub-100 Ordinals, considered to be highly sought after in the digital collectibles space. This recent transaction follows a previous successful brokerage by Rare BTC, where inscription number 20 was sold for 3 BTC.
The company’s role in the Ordinals market includes connecting collectors, artists, and independent brokers to facilitate transactions. BTC Inc.'s established network within the Bitcoin community and its reputation for reliability play a crucial part in completing these sales, particularly as it offers escrow services to ensure secure exchanges between buyers and sellers.
Those interested in acquiring or selling prime Ordinal inscriptions, or seeking brokerage partnerships, can reach out to Rare BTC through their email at rare@b.tc or DM on Twitter (X). Further information about their services and offerings can be accessed on their website.
Bitcoin Magazine was a pioneer in the Ordinals space, having inscribed its own historic print magazine covers into the bitcoin blockchain among the first 100,000 inscriptions. The oldest cover, Historic Cover #1, sold for 1.25 BTC at auction.]]></summary>

Bitcoin has withstood internal attacks from developers trying to radically alter the system, it has withstood the same attack from most of the major businesses in the space, it has survived what could have been fatal and catastrophic bugs, super powers banning it, wild price volatility, etc. It has stood up to everything to date that has been thrown at it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine predicting Bitcoin's death on a website that no longer exists.
That's what blogger Sean Lynch did 13 years ago today, when he wrote what 99 Bitcoins now classifies as the world's first "Bitcoin obituary," a news article that predicted the cryptocurrency's death or demise.
The post, titled "Why Bitcoin can’t be a currency," argued that Bitcoin lacked the mechanisms to handle fluctuations in demand, which would lead it to become worthless over time. He wrote: 
"In nature, positive feedback loops like exist with Bitcoin are lethal; the only thing that’s even kept Bitcoin alive this long is its novelty. Either it will remain a novelty forever or it will transition from novelty status to dead faster than you can blink."
Since then, Bitcoin, the world's most famous cryptocurrency, has defied critics and naysayers like Lynch, surging an astonishing 15 million percent in value since. Indeed, Bitcoin has consistently defied the odds, transforming from a niche experiment into a global financial phenomenon.
Still, the post, unearthed today by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo is notable for proving just how wrong Bitcoin critics can be, with Lynch specifically arguing that economies need intervention and that Bitcoin would fail because it lacked it.
"The reason this can’t happen with government currencies is that government currencies *are* backed," he wrote. "They’re backed by bullets. If demand for USD starts to fall faster than the USG would like, the USG can just raise taxes without increasing spending, increasing demand and reducing supply simultaneously. There’s a bunch of stuff the FED can do, of course, and the FED tends to act first, but its operations are harder to explain. This is obviously not a perfect mechanism, since bubbles are still blown and popped, but even this mechanism is not available with Bitcoin."
Today, more and more people are seeing just how destructive that intervention can be, with central banks struggling to contain inflation around the globe.]]></summary>
