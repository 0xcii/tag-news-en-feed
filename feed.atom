AMM Feature Unlikely To Affect XRP Price
 
Schwartz mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he doesn’t think the AMM feature on the XRP Ledger will have so much impact on the XRP price. He went on to recognize how new strategies, such as “arbitraging against the DEX”, can affect a token’s price. However, he opined that this volatility harvesting strategy will not decrease XRP’s price volatility any time soon.

Bitcoin Has Rallied Towards The $57,000 Level In The Past Day
 
After the initial rally to the $52,000 level earlier in the month, Bitcoin slumped into an extended spell of sideways movement, refusing to show any strong momentum in either direction.
 
 
Things have very quickly changed for the cryptocurrency in the past day, however, as its price has finally shown a sharp rally. The chart below shows what the coin’s trajectory has looked like recently.
 

 
 
As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin’s tight consolidation has just decompressed in spectacular fashion, as the asset has soared almost 11% within the past 24 hours.

This move signals a significant change in strategy for what is ranked as the world’s fifth-largest crypto exchange by trading volume.
 
 
The decision underscores the complexities and challenges facing crypto businesses seeking to navigate the regulatory environments of global financial hubs. In several jurisdictions worldwide, regulators have decided to take a strong stance against the nascent sector and related companies.
