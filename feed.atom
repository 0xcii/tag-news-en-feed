The Australian Financial Crimes Exchange said as much as 47% of all fraud and financial scam proceeds in the country are washed on crypto exchange platforms. 
 
Crypto a ‘Getaway Vehicle for Scam Money’
 
According to Anna Bligh, the CEO of the Australian Banking Association (ABA), an “alarming” portion of scam money often gets laundered via cryptocurrency exchange platforms. The CEO added that Australian authorities must also do more to “ensure cryptocurrency is not used as the getaway vehicle for scam money.” This would be in addition to stopping scams from reaching Australians via mobile phones, emails and social media, a report said.

This will allow Ledger Live users to buy bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH), and litecoin (LTC) within the app using Paypal.
 
Ledger Enables Paypal Payments for US Customers to Streamline Crypto Purchases Within App
 
On Wednesday, Ledger revealed Ledger Live users can now purchase BTC, ETH, BCH, and LTC using Paypal. The company believes this offers a “convenient, simple and secure way” to buy digital currencies through its companion application. Users can select Paypal as their payment method in the app’s “buy” section.
 
However, this is available only to users who have previously used Paypal to buy crypto assets. Ledger Live users new to Paypal for crypto “will be required to create a Paypal account or undergo a KYC verification,” according to Ledger. The company directed users to its Help Center for guidance on using Paypal for digital currency purchases.
 
“Both Paypal and Ledger are focused on creating secure, seamless, and fast transactions no matter where you are in the world. Paypal has remained at the forefront of the digital payment revolution for more than 20 years, and we are thrilled to come together in this next period of asset innovation with our integration,” said Pascal Gauthier, Ledger’s chairman and CEO.
 
 
This development comes after Paypal introduced its own stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar, named PYUSD. Though announced, PYUSD hasn’t yet been made available to the general public. Over the past two years, Paypal expanded its crypto services. However, this week, the payment giant paused crypto purchases in the U.K., citing regulatory shifts. The company stated that crypto buying in the United Kingdom would resume in early 2024.
