The move is in response to the growing interest in NFTs and their unique user experiences. Google has been working with Web3 game makers such as Mythical Games to bring blockchain gaming recognition to the masses.
 
Google Play’s Blockchain And NFT Policy Update
 
Previously, blockchain game companies had difficulty distributing their games, as they often relied on the open web for distribution. As part of the new policy, developers must be transparent with users about tokenized digital assets.

Protocol in ‘Paused State’
 
Rodeo Finance, a leveraged yield farming product, recently became the latest decentralized finance (defi) protocol to fall victim to the so-called force-investment hack after criminals stole approximately $1.7 million on July 10. As a consequence, the defi protocol has been placed in paused state “until a remediation plan has been finalized and implemented alongside the advice of multiple security experts.”

Macaroons are special tokens used for authentication. They include permissions and can be verified using a root key. The documentation states this is important for systems where we want to avoid or cannot go about looking up the validity of each token.
Lightning is a Layer 2 solution for making fast and secure bitcoin payments. L402 leverages the capabilities of Macaroons and Lightning to create a mechanism that allows users to authenticate and make payments without needing a central database.

        <updated>2023-07-12T21:36:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Blockchain Association, a nonprofit organization advocating for pro-innovation policies in relation to Bitcoin, has called for an investigation into the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its approval of Prometheum Ember Capital as a Special Purpose Broker Dealer (SPBD). In a letter to the Inspector General of the SEC, the association raises concerns about potential impropriety and ethical issues surrounding the approval process.



The letter highlights the lack of regulatory clarity regarding how U.S. securities laws apply to digital assets and criticizes SEC Chair Gary Gensler, accusing the SEC of overt hostility towards the digital assets industry while citing enforcement actions and proposed rulemaking that have impacted the sector. The approval of Prometheum as an SPBD is seen as concerning, as other companies with what the letter describes as "legitimate business models" have faced denials or delays in obtaining similar licenses.
The letter states Prometheum's license approval comes at a time when the company has no working product or assets, raising further questions. The association questions whether Prometheum received preferential treatment or leveraged personal connections to gain an unfair advantage. They express concern that SEC Chair Gensler is using Prometheum and the SPBD licensure process to impede congressional efforts towards legislation and promote what it views as a false narrative, that the law is clear regarding digital asset securities. “There's no question Prometheum is hiding something on its SEC relationship,” said Dan Spuller, head of industry affairs at the Association. 
The Blockchain Association has submitted a request to the SEC under the Freedom of Information Act, seeking documents and communications related to the matter. They urge the opening of an investigation to address these concerns and provide clarity. The outcome of the investigation will determine whether there was any impropriety or validate the inferences made by the association.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the Fantom Foundation addressed its community on the multi-million dollar exploit on Multichain, acknowledging the difficult situations of its network users, token holders, and liquidity providers (LPs). 
 
While awaiting “guidance” and an official statement from Multichain, the foundation said it would take direct steps to ensure the Fantom network adapts to the new circumstances.
 
This comes as a response to the uncertainty that clouded the Layer-1 project after the unauthorized movement of over $100 million worth of crypto assets from Multichain’s Fantom bridge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On July 12, 2023, onchain data shows the U.S. government transferred 9,800 bitcoins (BTC), worth just over $300 million. These bitcoins originally came from James Zhong’s Silk Road hack. In March, the Department of Justice also moved a similar amount of bitcoins associated with Silk Road.
 
Silk Road Bitcoin Stash Controlled by the Feds Moves, Funds Reportedly Sent to Coinbase
 
About 9,800 BTC from Silk Road was moved in two transactions on Wednesday, reportedly sent to wallets controlled by Coinbase. At the time of writing, the funds held by the U.S. government are worth $302 million, based on the day’s BTC exchange rates.
 
The bitcoins came from James Zhong, the convicted Silk Road hacker. At the time of his arrest, federal authorities seized about 51,351.89785803 bitcoins on three separate occasions, along with a collection of precious metals and $661,900 in cash.

Last March, the government sold 9,861 bitcoins for just over $200 million. The onchain activity four months prior was also detected by onchain observers and blockchain parsers. It’s speculated that all the BTC transferred from Zhong’s stash has been sold on Coinbase.
 
 
The selling through Coinbase is unusual as the U.S. government typically auctions off BTC with assistance from the U.S. Marshals. For example, bitcoins seized from Ross Ulbricht in the Silk Road case were auctioned, with investors like Tim Draper purchasing some of the coins. Only recently has the government started moving cryptocurrency to spot exchanges.
