        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Bitcoin and crypto space, the spotlight is once again on Justin Sun, the enigmatic figure behind the Tron blockchain. Recent allegations by prominent crypto researcher @ErgoBTC and a tweet by Adam Cochran have raised serious questions about the backing of TRC-20 Bitcoin on the Tron network.
 
With approximately 60,000 Bitcoin potentially unbacked, the Bitcoin community and the wider crypto industry are left wondering about the true state of affairs. The controversy centers around a potentially unbacked mint of 60.000 BTC TRC20 (worth $1.2billion) by Justin Sun and a transfer to JustLend, a decentralized lending platform on the Tron blockchain, for a 600 million USDC loan.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-falls-below-30000-on-friday-a-week-after-xrp-ruling/"/>
        <updated>2023-07-21T12:33:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin dropped below the $30,000 level on Jul 21, as market sentiment continued to trend lower in today’s session. This comes a week after cryptocurrency markets surged following the XRP ruling, however momentum has since faded as a result of profit taking. Ethereum was also down on Friday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) remained in the red on Friday, as the cryptocurrency moved back below the $30,000 level.
 
After hitting a high of $30,406.45 on Thursday, BTC/USD fell to a bottom at $29,638.10 earlier in the day.
 
This decline resulted in bitcoin moving near Tuesday’s floor at $29,525, which was a one-month low.

The latest sell-off came as the relative strength index (RSI) dropped below a key support point at 49.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 48.09, with the 46.00 mark a potential target for sellers.
 
Additionally, the 10-day (red) moving average has begun separating from its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could be a sign of an upcoming downturn.
 
 
Ethereum
 
After making a strong rebound on Thursday, ethereum (ETH) was largely lower in today’s session.
 
ETH/USD edged to a bottom at $1,879.73 earlier today, which comes a day after peaking around $1,920.
 
Friday’s sell-off briefly sent ethereum below a support level of $1,880, however bulls have since moved to stabilize this floor.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Unlike with BTC, ethereum’s 10-day (red) moving average remains upwards facing, which could be a sign of sentiment in the market being bullish.
 
In order to validate this theory, there will first have to be a breakout on the RSI, in particular of a ceiling at 52.00.
 
The index is currently tracking at 49.86.

For some, January 3 has become “Proof Of Keys Day” to promote the importance of holding one’s own private keys, as opposed to trusting them with a cryptocurrency exchange or other third party.
