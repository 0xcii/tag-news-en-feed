        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The once-feverish NFT marketplace, where digital art and collectibles commanded millions, now resembles a deserted online bazaar. A new report paints a stark picture – a 97% plunge in trading volume since 2021 and a staggering 95% of NFT projects holding zero market value.
 
This dramatic decline begs the question: is the NFT market headed for extinction, or is this just a temporary hiccup?
 
 
From Jpeg Millionaires To Tumbleweed Sales
 
Just two years ago, NFTs were the new gold rush. Beeple’s $69 million digital collage sale became a cultural phenomenon, and stories of overnight millionaires from “on-chain jpegs” fueled a speculative frenzy. However, that frenzy seems to have fizzled out.
 
Today, the average NFT sale struggles to break the $200 mark, a far cry from the seven-figure sum…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), known for operating one of the largest US-based futures exchanges, is planning to offer spot Bitcoin trading to its clients, according to a report by the Financial Times.
CME Expansion in Crypto Markets
Although not officially confirmed or commented on by the exchange, the plans to offer Bitcoin trading came when demand for the cryptocurrency among Wall Street money managers was surging. If launched, it would not be CME’s first foray into cryptocurrencies. The Chicago-based exchange is already operating a cryptocurrency futures exchange, which offers standard and micro futures contracts of Bitcoin and Ether. CME even ranks at the top of Bitcoin futures exchanges in terms of open interest, surpassing Binance, which otherwise dominates the spot market.

cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has experienced significant growth over the past  
year and, after five years of operation, has surpassed 20 million users.  
However, its expansion is not as dynamic in some regions due to local  
regulatory challenges.
One such  
example is France, where the local financial commission, AMF, blacklisted Bybit  
two years ago. Now, the national regulator issued a new warning to retail  
investors about the exchange, reminding of its lack of authorization in this  
part of Europe.
AMF Reminds: Bybit is  
Blacklisted in France
Under  
French law, digital asset service providers (DASPs) must register with the AMF  
before offering services connected to digital assets, including operating a crypto
