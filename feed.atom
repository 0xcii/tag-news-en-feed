Similarities to Japan’s Lost Decades in China’s Current Economic Slowdown
 
In a compelling parallel drawn between the economic trajectories of Japan starting in the 1980s and China’s current economic landscape, experts are now closely examining the similarities and lessons that can be learned.
 
Japan, in the 1980s, experienced a period of significant economic growth, marked by strong wage growth and rising prices. However, this was followed by a prolonged period of economic stagnation and deflation, from which, according to some, Japan is only now beginning to emerge. The cri…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Solana Saga phone, which was previously having trouble finding a buyer, has had a remarkable turnaround this week, with devices selling for as high as $5,000 on the web marketplace Ebay—a sharp rise above its earlier summer markdown.
 
The main cause of this sharp change of demand, which occurred after critics labeled the phone a “failure,” is the meteoric rise of the Solana-based meme coin BONK, which has seen an increase in value of over 10,000% over the last two months.
 
 
Solana Saga Phones Soar With BONK Airdrop
 
Sales of Solana Saga phones increased last week as a result of certain arbitrage traders seemingly pursuing an airdrop of 30 million BONK tokens, which is distributed to all phone owners. In peak value last week, the airdrop was more than $700 for a $599 phone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Central Bank of Brazil opened a new public consultation to obtain feedback for regulating the operations of virtual assets service providers (VASPs) in the country. The bank organized a questionnaire of 38 questions divided into different themes that can be partially, or fully answered until January 31, 2024.
Central Bank of Brazil Seeks Input on VASP Regulation
The Central Bank of Brazil is preparing to finally issue rules for Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs) operating in the country. The institution opened a public consultation seeking input from market participants and individuals to prepare the rules VASPs would have to follow, according to the faculties it received since the approval and sanction of the cryptocurrency assets law in December 2023.
The bank introduced a 38-item questionnaire that can be answered totally or partially, indicating the numbers and themes respondents want to address in their statements.
Each question is part of a broader subject of the public consultation, including areas such as asset segregation and risk management, activities developed and virtual assets traded, hiring essential services, governance and conduct rules, cyber ​​security, providing information and protecting customers, transition rules, and general manifestations.
The issue of asset segregation has significance, given that it was initially proposed to be part of the final text of the approved cryptocurrency assets law, but was finally left out due to the limitations it would impose on the operations that VASPs could conduct. Tax exemptions for mining projects leveraging renewable energy were also left out of the final text and might be affected by these rules.
The public consultation process will be open until January 31, 2024, and all answers will be publicly available for review on the bank’s page.
What do you think about the public consultation of the Central Bank of Brazil to regulate the operation of VASPs? Tell us in the comments section below.]]></summary>

This significant expenditure is primarily attributed to creating and moving tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using inscriptions, a novel method gaining traction in the blockchain world.
 
Inscriptions have emerged as a creative bypass on networks like Bitcoin, which lack native token support. By embedding text in standard blockchain transactions and employing an external numbering system, these inscription-based tokens offer a unique approach to token creation and movement.

The Solana Saga phone, once struggling to find its market, has seen its fortunes reversed this week, with units selling for as much as $5,000 on Ebay, a staggering increase from its discounted price earlier this summer. This dramatic shift in demand is primarily attributed to the explosive rise of the Solana-based meme coin, BONK, which experienced more than a 10,000% surge in the past two months.

Central to Back’s arguments lies the recently rising cost of transacting on the mainnet. Though the most valuable, Bitcoin has remained unchanged, especially on throughput, for the last 15 years. Under light loads, Bitcoin can only process seven transactions every second (TPS), a concern considering its role in the sphere.
