FTT Price Jumps More Than 80% Over FTX 2.0 Speculation
 
On Thursday, FTT’s value soared, escalating from an early-day trough of $1.22 to a zenith of $2.38. Sparking this ascent were disclosures hinting at Tom Farley, who steered the NYSE Group from 2014 to 2018, as a contender in the pool of prospective buyers for FTX.

Crypto Futures Market Has Registered Mass Liquidations During Past Day
 
A futures contract is said to be “liquidated” when the derivative exchange with which it’s open forcefully closes it up due to the position amassing losses of a specific degree (the exact percentage could differ from platform to platform).
 
There are two factors that can significantly raise the risk of a contract undergoing liquidation. First and the most obvious one is the volatility of the asset with which the contract is open. A high amount of price fluctuations naturally means that it’s harder to bet in any specific direction.
 
 
The other factor is the leverage that the use…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spurred on by enthusiasm for a forthcoming spot ETF, Bitcoin has catapulted to an 18-month high, surpassing the $37,000 mark Thursday.
The cryptocurrency's resurgence comes after a period of relative disinterest from mainstream market participants. With most eyes on the trial of disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, the news was apocalyptic, with major news sources decrying the death of not just Bitcoin but cryptocurrency. 
Still, the surge in Bitcoin's price can be attributed to a combination of factors, including renewed institutional interest, growing adoption, and a favorable macroeconomic climate. 
Institutional investors, often considered a significant driving force behind Bitcoin's price movements, have once again shown confidence in the digital asset, fueling its upward trajectory.
As global economic uncertainties persist, investors are turning to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. The decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency provides a level of security and autonomy that traditional financial instruments struggle to match.
 
         
         
         
         
    
The $37,000 milestone sets up the more significant $40,000 psychological barrier to be broken, instilling a renewed sense of optimism in the cryptocurrency community. 
But as Bitcoin continues to capture headlines and the attention of both retail and institutional investors, the question on everyone's mind is whether this bullish trend will persist into the new year.]]></summary>
