        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to Pavel Salas, the chief growth officer at Gear Foundation, on-chain smart contract automation makes applications “truly decentralized” because it “removes dependencies on centralized servers or external entities.” Salas also claimed that on-chain smart contract automation means participants can “engage in transactions or exchanges without relying on a central authority.”
 
Webassembly Not a ‘Direct Replacement for EVM’
 
In his written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, Salas argued that on-chain smart contract automation also helps decentralized applications (dapps) maintain data integrity without having to rely on external databases. He said since the code of smart contracts deployed on the blockchain is immutable this means it cannot be altered once deployed.

Bitcoin halvings, which occur approximately every four years, are pivotal events in the cryptocurrency's history. During these events, the rate at which new Bitcoin is created through mining is reduced, resulting in a reduction in the asset's issuance.
As alluded by Zhao, this supply shock has historically had a significant impact on the price of Bitcoin, resulting in all-time highs in 2013, 2017, and 2021.
Zhao's remarks on the potential for "all-time highs" following the 2024 Bitcoin halving are grounded in historical trends. Over the past three halvings, Bitcoin has experi…]]></summary>
