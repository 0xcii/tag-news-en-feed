High Transactional Costs of Converting Rupees
 
The Indian oil ministry recently informed a standing committee of parliament that the country’s attempt to have oil producers accept payment in the local currency has failed.

Why This Critic Is Choosing To Buy
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, XRP critic Cousin Crypto mentioned that he was bidding for the crypto token. Such a move will usually not be expected from him, considering his reservations about XRP.
