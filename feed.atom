        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tron was one of the notable movers on Saturday, as the token broke out of a key resistance level to start the weekend. The move came as the global crypto market cap mostly consolidated during Saturday’s session. Stellar was another exception, as the token rebounded from yesterday’s loss.
 
Tron (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) was a notable gainer to start the weekend, with the price surging to a 20-month high.
 
After dropping to a low of $0.08035 on Friday, TRX/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $0.09317 earlier in the day.
 
This was the highest point tron has hit since December 2021, and comes following a breakout of a ceiling at $0.08600.
 
 
This coincides with the relative strength index (RSI) moving past its own ceiling at 70.00. It is now tracking at 71.35.
 
Earlier gains have since faded, with the token now back below the aforementioned resistance level of $0.08600.
 
This appears to be a result of traders capturing profits.
 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
In addition to TRX, stellar was also largely in the green on Saturday, as the token rebounded from Friday’s losses.
 
XLM/USD rose to a high of $0.1674 to start the weekend, which comes a day after trading at a low of $0.1561.
 
This rally resulted in stellar breaking out of a recent resistance level of $0.1620, and edging closer to a 15-month high of $0.1959.
 
 
One of the reasons for today’s climb was the RSI racing past its own ceiling at the 70.00 mark.
 
Price strength is now overbought, which could prompt bears to reenter the market in anticipation of a sell-off.

Musk said users should follow Ark Invest’s research, where they can preview Tesla’s short variances in gross margin and profitability. In his view, these variances are “minor” relative to the long-term picture and holding Tesla’s stock is a “big long-term investment”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated around the $30,000 level to start the weekend, as traders attempted to find a firm price floor on Saturday. The market has been volatile during the past week, as recent winners took profits, following the XRP-related bull run. Ethereum remained below $1,900 on Saturday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the weekend trading close to the $30,000 level, as markets consolidated following recent price volatility.
 
BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $30,046.00, which comes following an earlier low of $29,746.12.
 
The move sees bitcoin climb back above a recent support point of $29,800, which has held mostly firm for the past week.
 
 
One of the reasons for the stabilized floor is due to the relative strength index (RSI), which is hovering close to a support of its own at 49.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 49.77, with the next visible resistance point at the 50.00 mark.
 
In order for BTC to climb beyond the $30,000 mark, this ceiling on the RSI will first need to be broken.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum was also consolidating during today’s session, as the cryptocurrency remained below $1,900.
 
Following a high of $1,905.39 on Friday, ETH/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,885.30 earlier in today’s session.
 
Similar to BTC, ethereum’s decline saw the cryptocurrency fall to a key support point of $1,880 to start the weekend.
 
 
This comes as price strength hovers around its own floor around the 50.00 zone, which has been in place since the start of the week.
 
Despite this, it still appears that the 10-day (red) moving average is trending higher, however this could begin to shift in the coming days.
