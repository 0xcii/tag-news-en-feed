        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital, has expressed strong optimism about Bitcoin’s future, particularly in the wake of the upcoming halving event expected in April 2024.
 
Scaramucci, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, shared his views in a recent interview with CNBC. He pointed to historical trends following halving events, which reduce the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation, as a reason for his bullish outlook.
 
 
Scaramucci predicts BTC price to reach at least $170,000 by the end of the current cycle, which aligns with past price surges after halvings. His long-term vision is even more ambitious, with a target of $400,000 – a price point that would represent half the market capitalization of gold.

FTX recently received a court order to sell its massive SOL holdings to repay its creditors. As one of the largest holders of the cryptocurrency, the news of the court order sparked a wave of concerns from SOL investors, as a total selloff by FTX could tank the price of the cryptocurrency in just a few hours. Interestingly, the bankrupt crypto exchange has now gone ahead to sell a majority of its holdings below market value.
