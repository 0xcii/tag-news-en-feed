        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a potentially game-changing moment for the crypto sector, the US Senate has passed H.J. Res 109, a bill seeking to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121 om Thursday, May 16. The bill was passed with substantial bipartisan support, receiving a 60-38 vote in the Senate and earlier approval from the House.
 
SAB 121, implemented in 2022, mandated digital asset custodians to list digital assets as liabilities on their balance sheets, a requirement widely criticized within the crypto community. Critics argue that this regulation unfairly treats customer-owned digital assets as the custodian’s liabilities, thereby necessitating equivalent cash reserves to offset these “liabilities.”
