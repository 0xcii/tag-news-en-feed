North America became the leading hub of bitcoin mining activity after China’s abrupt ban in May 2021. While the United States has grabbed most of the news headlines and a significant portion of investor attention, Canada has also solidified its role as a global leader in mining. From industrial mining farms to off-grid guerrilla mining operations, Canada is home to miners of all stripes.
But the final months of 2022 saw several provinces target bitcoin miners and suspend any new grid connections while “environmental assessments” were initiated. This article provides an overview of the localized changes in regulatory posture toward miners.

Cleanspark, a publicly traded bitcoin miner based in Las Vegas, Nevada, has announced their December 2022 bitcoin mining update, in addition to comments from the CEO reflecting on 2022. 
“Among our many accomplishments this year, I’m most proud of increasing our annual bitcoin production by over 200% as we expanded our fleet and the number of mining campuses we own and operate throughout Georgia,” said Zach Bradford, CEO, in the release. “Even in this down market, we are committed to the promise of bitcoin and are proud to be part of the global network that keeps it secure for millions of users across the world.”
The company mined a total of 464 bitcoin in the month of December, to conclude 2022 with a total of 4,621 bitcoin mined. As of December 31, the company held 228 bitcoin while it sold 517 bitcoin in December for operations and growth.
Like other public miners this year, Cleanspark has faced a dramatic downturn in its stock price, just as the price of bitcoin fell similarly. Despite this, when priced in bitcoin, Cleanspark has maintained a relatively steady valuation, and has continued to expand its operations. 
In September, mining expert Zack Voell detailed how the energy company turned miner is continuing to grow despite the various headwinds currently present in the bitcoin market. This continued with ASIC acquisitions in the following months, as well as record production of bitcoin in October. 
The December report also detailed the company’s operational reactions to the winter storm which ravaged the United States that month, describing how 98% of its machines present in Georgia were powered down due to the conditions. The machines were turned back on as soon as the temperature and humidity levels permitted.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lugano, Switzerland makes living on a Bitcoin standard possible with hundreds of merchants that accept BTC.
If you’ve ever sought to live entirely on bitcoin, look no further than Lugano Switzerland. 

The Plan ₿ foundation recently took to Twitter to announce a new map which showcases the hundreds of merchants across the city that accept bitcoin. “Now you can live in Lugano just using Bitcoin!,” the tweet read. “Find out all you need to enjoy your stay in Lugano through the map with all Lugano’s Plan ₿ merchants.”


 
         
         
         
        A screenshot of the map posted.
 
    
Plan ₿ is a city initiative designed in collaboration with Tether to attract wealth, smart minds and opportunities. Part of this plan involved Lugano making bitcoin a de-facto legal tender, which was announced in March 2022.



This was followed by the announcement of the Plan ₿ Summer School, an educational opportunity for those looking to learn more about bitcoin and businesses, which took place in July 2022. The school featured expert speakers including the likes of Blockstream CEO Adam Back.
Most recently, the Plan ₿ foundation partnered with GoCrypto to onboard multiple merchants to accept bitcoin, including McDonald’s and various art galleries. At that time, the foundation predicted it would serve over 2,500 customers using bitcoin by the end of the year. 
The Plan ₿ foundation confirmed on Twitter today that visitors and residents alike can “pay with Bitcoin for food, drinks, art, fashion, jewelry, cars, watches, tattoos, real-estate, municipal taxes, and services and so much more…”



As the bitcoin ecosystem grows, various jurisdictions will continue to vie for the business of Bitcoiners and Bitcoin companies. This can be seen in examples like Lugano, as well as that of Madeira, Bitcoin Beach and several others. While bitcoin is still in its infancy, developments like these serve both as a testing battle ground and a way to push for greater adoption and improvements.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana extended recent gains on Wednesday, as the token rose by as much as 15% in today’s session. The move saw prices hit their highest point since mid-December, and comes as market sentiment has shifted in a bullish direction. Cardano was also in the green, as it hit a one-week high today.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rose for a sixth straight session on Wednesday, as market momentum remains bullish.
 
SOL/USD surged to a high of $14.10 earlier in the day, less than a day after trading at a low of $11.83.
 
Today’s rally saw the token climb to its highest point since December 15, when it last collided with a resistance level of $14.50.
 
 
Looking at the chart, Wednesday’s surge comes as SOL moved beyond a ceiling of 53.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 59.79, which is its strongest point since Nov. 6.
 
Bulls in solana will likely continue to attempt a breakout of a ceiling at $14.50 in the coming days.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Another notable gainer on Wednesday was cardano (ADA), which climbed to a one-week high earlier today.
 
Following a low of $0.2505 on Tuesday, ADA/USD raced to a peak of $0.2668 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw the token collide with a long-term resistance level of $0.2660, hitting its highest level since December 27 in the process.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, this rally pushed the RSI to its own resistance of 47.00, which has resulted in earlier gains easing.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 46.75, with cardano trading at $0.2649 ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes for December.
 
The moving average of 10 days (red), and its 25-day (blue) counterpart have also neared in proximity, which could be catalyst for an upwards cross later in the week.

Now, with Gemini customers and creditors turning the heat up on the exchange to recover their funds, co-founder Cameron Winklevoss has taken the fight directly to DCG as he gives them an ultimatum to return owed funds.
 
One Week To Return $900 Million
 
Cameron, one-half of the infamous Winklevoss twins who founded the Gemini crypto exchange, took to Twitter to publish a scathing response to DCG CEO Barry Silbert. When Genesis Trading, which exists under the DCG umbrella, paused withdrawals, it had stranded over 340,000 Gemini Ear users. It is now more than a month since this happened and there has been no progress or word on wh…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something big just happened on the Bitcoin blockchain. Crypto analytics firm CoinMetrics noted that $8 trillion worth of transactions have been made on the crypto king blockchain. This means that more and more people are using Bitcoin to transact in their daily lives more than ever.
 
But does this mean a widespread adoption is already underway? 
 
What Does This Milestone Mean? 
 
The $8 trillion transaction metric might not be so much of a big deal as some would hope. The number was generated over the course of 2022, a period that was strongly bearish against the entire financial system as a whole. A quick look at the charts show that at the start of 2022, Bitcoin has already fallen from its all-time-high back in November of 2021.
