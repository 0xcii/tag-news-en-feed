        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cardano climbed higher to start the week, as bulls moved to buy the recent dip in price. The token dropped by over 30% over the weekend, as traders continued to react to the Robinhood delisting. Cosmos also rebounded, moving away from a one-year low.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) rebounded by nearly 5% to start the week, as traders moved to buy this weekend’s dip.
 
ADA/USD fell by over 30% in the past few days, dropping to a low of $0.2300 in the process.
 
However on Monday, the token rallied to an intraday peak of $0.2859, with bulls seemingly finding a stable floor at $0.2600.
 
 
This comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped back above the 20.00 region, and is now heading towards a ceiling at 31.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 24.99, which remains in oversold territory.
 
ADA is currently trading at $0.2815, down 24% from the same point last week.
 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Another notable token to climb higher on Monday was cosmos (ATOM), which also rebounded from recent losses.
 
Following a low of $8.21 on Sunday, ATOM/USD jumped to a high of $8.68 to start the new trading week.
 
The rally sees ATOM continue to move away from a one-year low at $7.31, which was hit on Saturday.
 
 
Similar to cardano, ATOM’s RSI reading remains below the 30.00 mark, which is a positive for longer-term bulls.
 
This shows that there is some potential upside in the market. However, volatility also remains high.

Emefiele’s Presidential Aspirations
 
The Nigerian central bank governor, Godwin Emefiele, was on June 9 suspended by the West African nation’s new president Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The suspension is expected to pave the way for further investigations into Emefiele’s conduct throughout his tenure as head of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).

This move falls in line with a growing trend of US-based companies exploring opportunities beyond their domestic borders, seeking new avenues for growth and expansion. 
 
With the rise of regulatory actions against crypto firms in the US over the past few months, a16z’s announcement to establish a presence in another country can be seen as a strategic response to a changing business landscape.

Trust is a funny thing. Generationally speaking, one could make the argument that it is the job of the younger generation to essentially tell us older folks to go fly a kite (perhaps in more raw terms, and metaphorically of course) when it comes to our values, our norms, our advice, etc. Music provides an apt cultural landscape on which to view this tension.
The Same Old Song
In every generation, emerging and evolving musical forms have been decried by the older, traditional set as being bad music, noise, even not music at all. In the late 1950s, Walter Cronkite referred to jazz as “musical noise,” and his words were not offered as praise. Rockab…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin started the week trading marginally below the $26,000 level, ahead of a key week of economic events. The headline being the upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. Ethereum remains below $1,800 ahead of this week’s rate decision.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade around the $26,000 level on Monday, as markets remain volatile following recent fundamental occurrences.
 
BTC/USD rose to a peak of $26,203 earlier in today’s session, following Sunday’s low at $25,675.
 
Monday’s peak sees bitcoin bulls attempt to break a resistance level of $26,300, however market sentiment remains largely bearish.

The relative strength index (RSI) is also tracking close to a level of resistance, with a current reading at 42.16.
 
This is marginally below an upcoming ceiling at 46.00, and slightly above a support point near the 41.00 region.
 
Additionally, the 10-day (red) moving average has maintained its downward course, further expanding bearish sentiment.
 

 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) remained below $1,800 to start the week, tracking close to a multi-month low in the process.
 
Following a high at $1,776.85 on Sunday, ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,722.91 on Monday.
 
This pushed ethereum closer to the weekend’s low at $1,716, which was its weakest point since March 28.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
As a result of this latest decline, ethereum’s 10-day (red) moving average has finally crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In addition to this, the RSI is currently tracking at 38.00, which remains around the oversold region.
 
To move beyond this point, price strength will need to climb past the 40.00 zone, however a floor at 31.00 could still be on radar for sellers.

The LTHs make up for one of the two main segments the Bitcoin market is generally divided in, with the other cohort being the “short-term holders” (STHs). Naturally, the STHs are holders who acquired their BTC less than 155 days ago.
