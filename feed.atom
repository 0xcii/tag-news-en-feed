Throughout its entire history, Bitcoin has been a wildly fluctuating asset. In the almost 15 years since the Genesis Block was mined, its greatest valuations have always come as a result of dramatic spikes, and the comedown from these highs has always been about as steep.

The journey of DeFi is fascinating, reflecting how blockchain tech has matured and how people are starting to realize it can shake up regular money systems.

Shiba Inu Supply On Exchanges Has Plunged Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, the Shiba Inu supply on exchanges has seen a sharp drop recently. The “supply on exchanges” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating Shiba Inu supply that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric goes down, it means that the investors are transferring a net number of coins from these platforms toward their self-custodial wallets right now.
 
 
Generally, the main reason why holders would shift their coins in this way is to hold onto them for extended periods. Naturally, thi…]]></summary>

This sentiment, expressed in a two-part interview with Finance Magnates, comes in the wake of the SEC's aggressive legal actions against key players like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, despite their notable loss against Ripple.
