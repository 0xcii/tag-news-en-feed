        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a world where "talent is everywhere, opportunity is not," the existing fiat monetary system perpetuates the divide between those with access and resources those without. Even in democratic societies, which have their own flaws, people generally enjoy stable currencies, freedom, and rule of law.
