        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In filings with securities authorities released on Monday, renowned hedge fund manager Michael Burry, whose exploits were famously captured in the film “The Big Short,” took a bearish stance on the market. Burry’s Scion Asset Management shorted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 for the close of the second quarter, wagering approximately $1.6 billion on an impending stock market collapse.
 
A New ‘Big Short’? Michael Burry Wagers $1.6 Billion Against QQQ and SPY
 
Michael Burry appears to be taking a bearish stance on Wall Street once more, with Scion Asset Management’s latest Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 13F filing revealing a substantial acquisition of put options against Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: SPY).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has expressed its desire to establish a new form of digital money known as the Gold-Backed Digital Token (GBDT). This digital currency will be underpinned by gold bullion reserves held by the central bank.
 
The decision to undertake this action is in line with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s endeavors to achieve stability for its own currency, which has been experiencing significant devaluation.
 
The official introduction of GBDT was first made in May, in response to the urgent demand for dependable and feasible market-driven resolutions.
 
 
The presence of an exceptionally high inflation rate of 175.8% in June served as an additional catalyst for increased demand from domestic investors.

Despite surpassing the customary 160-day review period, market participants eagerly await the next batch review scheduled for Friday at 11 am. 
 
According to finance Lawyer Scott Johnsson, August is a crucial month due to the “cycling” of law clerks in the District of Columbia (DC) courts, leading to the potential clearance of pending cases before the arrival of new personnel. 
 
While the decision could extend into September, Johnson suggests August remains a promising timeframe for a ruling.

The FDIC is closely monitoring crypto activities at banks and said additional guidance is likely.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-sol-ton-move-to-multi-week-highs-on-tuesday/"/>
        <updated>2023-08-15T16:10:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana was one of Tuesday’s big gainers, rising to a multi-week high following a ‘death cross’ of moving averages. The move came despite the global market cap falling marginally lower as of the time of writing. Toncoin was another notable mover, rising for a sixth-straight day.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) surged higher on Tuesday, as sentiment in the token has remained largely bullish in recent days.
 
SOL/USD peaked at $25.24 during today’s session, which follows up from a low of $24.35 to start the week.
 
This climb saw solana trade at its highest point since July 29, when price reached a high of $25.39.
 
 
The move came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should upward momentum continue to intensify, the next target for traders will likely be around the $26.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $24.82.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was also in the green in today’s session, as the price climbed for a sixth-consecutive session.
 
Following a low of $1.42 to start the week, TON/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1.49 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, toncoin moved to its strongest level since July 23, and closer to a ceiling of $1.50.
 
 
Similar to solana above, the rally came as the 10-day and 25-day moving averages neared an upwards cross.
 
One area of concern for bulls is the current reading of the RSI indicator, which is tracking at 66.91.
 
This is the highest area it has reached in the coin’s history, meaning it is greatly overbought, with bears potentially waiting to take advantage of this.

        <updated>2023-08-15T15:06:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the last crypto bull market, Dogecoin was a clear leader among altcoins and beat Bitcoin by miles in terms of return on investment (ROI).
 
Could this old dog be up to it’s same tricks? The meme coin is mere pennies away from triggering a “parabolic” signal that the last time around resulted in a 25,000% gain.
 
Why Dogecoin Could Become A Bull-Dog
 
Dogecoin has lost a large share of its former value alongside the rest of the crypto industry. This is common during a bear market. But during a bull market, the returns have historically been shocking.
 
 
The meme coin became the poster child of the last crypto bull run, famously being mentioned numerous times during Elon Musk’s Saturday Night Live performance.
 
That event was close to the peak of the previous cycle, and since then has been rolling over and playing dead. Soon, it could bite back. That is according to the Parabolic SAR indicator on the 1M DOGEUSD chart.
 

 
 
DOGE Closes In On Parabolic Buy Trigger
 
The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator created by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. who also created such tools as the Relative Strength Index, the Average Directional Index, and Average True Range.
 
The tool is used to tell a trader or investor that the trend has “stopped and reversed”. If DOGEUSD can tag the Parabolic SAR on the 1M timeframe, it could tell the market that the trend has officially changed.
 
 
The reason this is important, is because Dogecoin is typically an indication that altcoin season is approaching. When it begins to take off, so does the rest of the altcoin market. At least it has always historically done so.
 
A buy signal has only been triggered three times in the past, causing a 500%, 225%, and 25,000% rally, respectively. Will this signal once again prove as reliable as man’s best friend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin mostly consolidated on Tuesday, as traders anticipated the release of July’s retail sales data from the United States. Sales rose by 0.7%, better than the 0.4% expected, and this comes following a 0.2% increase in June. Ethereum also remained unchanged prior to the data.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was trading in the red for the majority of the day, as price consolidated prior to the release of U.S. retail sales data.
 
After peaking at $29,660.25 to start the week, BTC/USD fell to a low of $29,272.35 earlier in today’s session.
 
Since moving above $30,000 on August 8, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has mostly trended sideways.
 
 
One reason for a lack of direction appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI) tracking between a support and resistance of its own.
 
The index is currently at a reading of 47.57, and has mostly moved between a floor at 47.00, and ceiling at 49.00 in recent days.
 
For bulls, a breakout above the 49.00 zone will also likely be the straw needed to break the camel’s back.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) has remained largely unchanged in the past few days, rising by 0.11% in the past week.
 
ETH/USD bottomed out at $1,837.21 so far during today’s session, which is almost $20.00 lower than Monday’s high.
 
Price has mostly consolidated around a support point of $1,830 in recent days, however the prospect of a moving average crossover is keeping bullish hopes alive.
 
 
The 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages are on the cusp of an upwards crossover, which could likely send prices above $1,900.
 
Similar to BTC, there will first need to be a breakout above a ceiling on the RSI indicator for this to take place.
 
On this occasion the resistance point is at 47.00, and the index is currently tracking at 45.23.
