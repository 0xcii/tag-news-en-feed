        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) is navigating through a storm of fear and uncertainty, with recent volatile price action causing significant shakeouts among traders and investors. Since August 24, BTC has experienced a sharp retrace of over 12%, plunging below the $60,000 mark—a crucial psychological level that often serves as a pivot point for both price action and market sentiment.
 
 
As BTC fluctuates, parallels are drawn between its current structure and the 2016 bull market. With historical patterns suggesting a potential breakout, the question on everyone’s mind is whether Bitcoin is poised for a repeat of its past performance. As the market watches closely, the coming weeks could reveal if BTC will surge to new heights or face further challenges.

The Bitcoin Robbery: A Disturbing Encounter
 
The robbery took place in a quiet neighborhood near Glasgow late one night. The victim, known to be a cryptocurrency enthusiast, was inside his house when three masked men broke open the back door.
 
Using the machete and a big Toblerone to get the digital assets from him, the intruders were instilling fear into the victim. According to additional reports, one…]]></summary>

The analyst also warned against having too many expectations from the meme coin, suggesting that it is unlikely to have the kind of run it did in 2021. 
 
Shiba Inu Could Rise To As High As $0.00014
 
Zach Humphries mentioned in a video on his YouTube channel that Shiba Inu can “definitely” enjoy a 10x run from its current price level, meaning that it can reach a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.00014 in this bull run. A rise to such a price level also means that Shiba Inu will come close to hitting a $100 billion market cap, which the crypto analyst also noted is possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the FBI issued an alert warning that North Korean hackers are targeting U.S. cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a bid to steal digital assets. The hackers are using advanced social engineering techniques to breach the security of companies associated with these financial products, the FBI stated.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
According to the FBI, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has been conducting highly targeted social engineering attacks on employees within the decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency industries. These attacks involve detailed pre-operational research and customized scenarios designed to exploit the victim's specific interests and connections.
"North Korean malicious cyber actors conducted research on a variety of targets connected to cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (s) over the last several months," the FBI said. "This research included pre-operational preparations suggesting North Korean actors may attempt malicious cyber activities against companies associated with cryptocurrency ETFs or other cryptocurrency-related financial products."
The FBI emphasized that North Korean cyber actors are a persistent threat to organizations managing large quantities of cryptocurrency. Their tactics include impersonating trusted contacts, creating fake scenarios involving job offers or investments, and deploying malware through prolonged and convincing interactions with their targets.
The agency urged businesses in the cryptocurrency sector to adopt stringent security measures, including multi-factor authentication, limiting access to sensitive information, and verifying the identities of contacts through multiple channels. The FBI also recommended that companies with access to significant cryptocurrency holdings take extra precautions to safeguard their assets against these sophisticated cyber threats.]]></summary>

Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Retraced Its August Recovery
 
The “Mining Hashrate” refers to a Bitcoin metric that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that the miners have currently connected to the BTC network.
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means new miners are joining the blockchain and/or old ones are adding to their facilities. Such a trend implies that the network looks like an attractive venture to these chain validators.
 
 
On the other hand, the indicator registering a decline implies some of the miners have decided to disconnect from the chain, potentially because BTC mining is no longer profitable for them.
