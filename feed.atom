court has ordered Deltec International Group (DIG) to repay almost $53 million  
to Alameda Research, the crypto hedge fund linked to bankrupt cryptocurrency  
exchange, FTX. 
Alameda Gave $50M Loan in 2021
The loan repayment is based on

to an earlier court document, a total of USD$50 million was paid to DIG by  
Alameda on November 4, 2021, through the FTX Trading exchange. The amount was  
paid in the form of USDT at a 1:1 ratio to the US dollars. 
Furthermore, the court document  
reveals that loan was approved by Ryan Salame, FTX Digital Markets’ Co-CEO. The  
deal is also said to have involved Norton Hall, a company incorporated in  
Antigua and Barbuda.
