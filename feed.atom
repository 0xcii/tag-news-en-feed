Buterin’s post follows massive congestion on the Bitcoin network, which led to a surge in transaction fees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin continued to consolidate on Monday, ahead of U.S. debt ceiling talks with President Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. It is expected that if a deal isn’t reached this week, the government will run out of cash on June 1. Ethereum was marginally higher.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the week in consolidation, as markets remain hopeful of a deal to increase the debt ceiling in the United States.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,549.73, which comes less than 24 hours after a high at $26,986.08.
 
Overall, Monday’s move is the third straight day in which BTC has traded below the $27,000 mark.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
From the chart, it appears that BTC has now found a firm floor at $26,300, with prices hovering slightly above that point.
 
In order for a significant move to take place, a ceiling of 44.00, or support at 39.00, on the relative strength index (RSI), will need to be broken.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.18.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rose slightly higher on Monday, as it once again bounced from a key support point.
 
Following a low of $1,793.22 on Sunday, ETH/USD climbed to a peak of $1,820.25 earlier in the day.
 
The drop saw ethereum near its recent price floor at the $1,790 mark, however bulls used this as a sign to reenter the market.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Still, earlier gains have somewhat dropped, with the index currently tracking close to a ceiling of 46.00.
 
In order for momentum to fully turn bullish, this resistance will need to be broken, which is unlikely to happen until a debt ceiling deal is reached.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the fee dominance of the Inscriptions was at 62% during their peak. An “Inscription” here refers to any form of data directly inscribed into the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
The Inscriptions only became possible when the Ordinals protocol emerged earlier in the year, and since then, they have seen a number of applications and have earned some rapid popularity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Steven Hay, a writer, former trader and art dealer.
The Ordinals controversy is still simmering and seems set to flare up again soon. Although Ordinals’ block space usage had been trending down since March 23, 2023, the release of notable collections and a burgeoning mania for BRC-20 tokens seems to have reversed that trend. 
Should competition for block space between Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens and purely monetary transactions remain high, so will fees. And, should fees climb sufficiently high, the ghastly shades of the blocksize war may rise once more to torment all Bit-kind.
The Case Against Ordinals
Fees aren't the only flashpoint. While Bitcoin has certainly had its share of negative headlines over the years, the protocol itself has thus far escaped the sam…]]></summary>

 In the EU, this week saw MiCA regulations signed off, with the rules expected to come into play next year. However, this does not mean that the path to crypto integration in Europe is now entirely clear. MiCA is a start and to some extent a work in progress, and there will no doubt be continuing disagreements between regulators and industry participants.
That said, these steps in Europe represent an attempt at clarity and are in sharp contrast to the situation in the United States, where there is a lack of consistency and a sense of uncertainty.
