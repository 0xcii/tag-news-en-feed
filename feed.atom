— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 4, 2024
  
  
  
"Since the first Bitcoin transaction in 2009, digital assets have developed from a niche technology innovation to a globally recognized asset class," said Manfred Bauer, Global Head of DWS’ Product Division and Member of the Executive Board at DWS Group. "With a combined market capitalization of more than USD 1.7 trillion, bitcoin and ethereum alone are now too significant for investors and asset managers to ignore."
The Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Bitcoin ETC is now listed on Deutsche Börse, allowing investors to participate directly in the Bitcoin market with the security and transparency of exchange-traded products. The ETCs are physically backed by BTC, ensuring that investors have direct exposure to bitcoin's price movements.
DWS stated it has strategically partnered with Galaxy to promote Bitcoin adoption in Europe, leveraging Galaxy's expertise in digital asset products and services. "We are delighted to be working with Xtrackers to offer investors institutional-grade access to digital assets and to support them with our deep digital asset expertise," commented Steve Kurz, Global Head of Asset Management at Galaxy.
State Street will serve as the Issuing and Paying Agent and Administration Agent for these ETCs, with MSCI providing reference prices for bitcoin, stated the official announcement. The ETCs are 1:1 physically backed and utilize cryptocurrency custodians Zodia Custody and Coinbase for secure storage in offline custody accounts. The ETCs will also boast an annual product fee of 0.35%.]]></summary>

Yesterday, Irina Dilkinska, the former head of Legal and Compliance for OneCoin, was sentenced to four years in prison by US District Judge Edgardo Ramos for her role in the multi-billion dollar scam.
 
 
Dilkinska’s sentencing marks another step in the ongoing legal saga surrounding OneCoin. Launched in 2014 by Ruja Ignatova and Karl Sebastian Greenwood, OneCoin promised investors a revolutionary new cryptocurrency. However, authorities allege that the project was a fraudulent scheme from the outset, designed to enrich its founders at the expense of unsuspecting victims.
