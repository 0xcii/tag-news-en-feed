        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The largest marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Opensea, has announced major changes to its fee structure and policies in response to a shift in the NFT ecosystem. The company detailed that it will drop fees to zero for a limited time and offer an optional creator earnings model with a minimum of 0.5% for all collections that do not use onchain enforcement.
 
Opensea Drops Fees While Facing Tough Competition from Rivals Like Blur, Looksrare, and X2Y2
 
Opensea, the NFT marketplace, announced on Friday that it is dropping fees in response to a major change that started in October 2022. “We began to see significant volume and users migrate to NFT marketplaces that do not fully enforce creator earnings,” Opensea said. “Today, that shift has accelerated dramatically despite our best efforts.”
 
Opensea pointed out that roughly 80% of the total ecosystem volume is not paying full creator earnings, and most of the sales volume has moved to a no-fee environment. The NFT market has faced competition recently from the new market Blur, which has captured $1.4 billion in all-time sales volume in a short period. However, Blur’s all-time sales are small in comparison to Opensea’s $34.53 billion in all-time sales.
 
 
The NFT marketplace also faces competition from digital collectible markets Looksrare and X2Y2. Opensea hopes the new changes will strike the right balance of incentives and motivations for all ecosystem participants, including creators, collectors, and power buyers and sellers. Additionally, the company announced it is updating its operator filter to allow sales using NFT marketplaces with the same policies, including Blur. “This is the start of a new era for Opensea. We’re excited to test this model,” the company said.

Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) remained close to a multi-month high on Saturday, following a breakout above a $7.15 resistance level.
 
DOT/USD surged to an intraday high of $7.39 to start the weekend, following a low of $6.71 the day prior.
 
Following Friday’s low, the token rose significantly higher as the day progressed, climbing to a six-month peak of $7.42.

As a result of this move, the 10-day (red) moving average is now nearing an upwards cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
This comes less than a week after a downward cross, however, momentum seems to have already shifted.
 
Should bulls maintain this trajectory, it is likely that $8.00 will be the short-term target.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) also moved higher to start the weekend, with prices climbing to a nine-day high.
 
Following a low of $7.26 on Friday, LINK/USD raced to a peak of $7.71 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move came as chainlink broke out of a resistance level at $7.60, with prices at their strongest point since February 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nigerian crypto payment gateway Fluidcoins was recently bought for an undisclosed sum by Blockfinex, in a deal which the former’s CEO Lanre Adenowo described as an “acquihire deal.” Blockfinex reportedly said it will leverage the acquisition to launch its own platform known as Blockpay.
 
Scaling Blockfinex’s Crypto Payment Processing Business
 
The Nigerian crypto payment gateway, Fluidcoins, was recently acquired for an undisclosed sum by the Seychelles-registered crypto exchange company Blockfinex. According to a Techcabal report, Blockfinex’s acquisition of a 100% stake in the Nigerian firm came some 18 months after Fluidcoins’ last capital raise of $150,000.
 
Commenting on the acquisition that was facilitated by Dan Holdings Limited, Blockfinex founder and CEO Danny Oyekan reportedly said:
 

This acquisition was driven by a decision to venture into wallet as a service business and crypto payment processing and scale it across the world.
 
Blockfinex reportedly said it will leverage the acquisition to launch its own platform known as Blockpay. Besides being a payment processor and application programming interface (API) wallet-as-a-service provider, Blockpay will facilitate payments for Fluidcoins’ existing clients such as Accrue, The Peer, and Getequity, the report added.
 

 
Meanwhile, Fluidcoins CEO Lanre Adenowo is quoted describing his firm’s reported acquisition by Blockfinex as an “acquihire deal” that will not result in management or staff changes. The deal nonetheless allows Fluidcoins to keep operating.
 
According to the report, the acquisition deal includes all of the Nigerian crypto payment gateway’s entities including Flip and Fluidshops.

This trend continued as Bitcoin surpassed the $25k mark for the first time since August 2022 this week, and some experts had predicted that the $30k could be the next resistance point. However, this was not the case, and Bitcoin was quickly rejected at $25k. 
 
Bitcoin Price Experiences Slight Correction At $25,000 
 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $24,478 and has been unable to break the $25,000 level decisively. Given the strong rejection at $25k, analysts believe Bitcoin may enter a period of consolidation before making a fresh move.
