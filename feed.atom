        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the much-awaited deadline for Bitcoin Spot ETF applications is drawing near, Ark Investment Management under the direction of Cathie Wood has sold off its entire Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) holdings.
 
Ark Invest Bitcoin Investment Strategy Shift
 
Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently reported the development on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, December 28. According to him, this strategic move came within a month after Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) became ARKW’s largest holding.
 
Ark Invest selling off its entire GBTC might be due to the anticipation of the Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval before the deadline on January 10, 2024. 
 
 
The Bloomberg analyst also pointed out that Ark Invest used half of the money valued at $100 million to purch…]]></summary>

The decision is intended to help diminish India’s reliance on the U.S. dollar when settling its cross-border obligations. 
 
High Transactional Costs of Converting Rupees
 
The Indian oil ministry recently informed a standing committee of parliament that the country’s attempt to have oil producers accept payment in the local currency has failed. The ministry cites the perceived high cost of converting the rupee to other major currencies as one of the reasons for the policy’s failure.

This hasn’t changed his stance, though, as he made it clear from his comments that he is still critical of the XRP token and its community. 
 
Why This Critic Is Choosing To Buy
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, XRP critic Cousin Crypto mentioned that he was bidding for the crypto token. Such a move will usually not be expected from him, considering his reservations about XRP. However, the crypto trader is choosing not to let his sentiments cloud his judgment as he believes that XRP could pump soon. 
 
 
Cousin Crypto’s belief stems from the fact that XRP has been “too quiet,” and a significant rally seems overdue. Indeed, XRP has been te…]]></summary>
