 In the EU, this week saw MiCA regulations signed off, with the rules expected to come into play next year. However, this does not mean that the path to crypto integration in Europe is now entirely clear. MiCA is a start and to some extent a work in progress, and there will no doubt be continuing disagreements between regulators and industry participants.
