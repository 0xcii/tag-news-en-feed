Binance’s Bitcoin Liabilities In Proof-Of-Reserves Report Are Consistent With On-Chain Data
 
The Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) here refers to the public proof that an exchange has backed its customers’ entire deposits with proper collateralization. Since the collapse of FTX, distrust around centralized platforms has grown among investors in the cryptocurrency market, and they have been demanding for exchanges to release PoR reports.
 
Around a week ago, Binance, the largest exchange by trading volume, revealed its PoR audit report by Mazars, but it was met with scrutiny by some analysts for a few reasons. One of the major points of criticism was that the crypto exchange had th…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-12-15T19:05:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The futures ETF will be the first of its kind available in Asia according to the asset manager, CSOP.
Investors in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be able to trade the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066.HK) starting December 16 according to a press release. The ETF will track the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin ETFs through active investment. It has received approximately $53 million in initial investments at a listing price of $1 (HKD 7.75).
The approval of the ETFs has both positive and negative connotations — while it signals acceptance amongst traditional finance in the Asian markets, it is not truly bitcoin in the sense that one cannot exchange the ETF shares for real bitcoin, nor is the ETF itself backed by a reserve of actual bitcoin. There are claims that such “paper bitcoin” can suppress the price of real bitcoin through diversion of demand. 

The first bitcoin futures ETF approved in America, the NYSE-listed ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, launched in October of 2021, with $1 billion in trading volume on its first day. Per the release, “In view of the increasing market acceptance of virtual assets, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission announced to allow the launch of ETFs tracking crypto futures for public offering on 31 October 2022, marking the first time Asian retail investors can get this type of exposure to virtual assets.”]]></summary>

This is an opinion editorial by Will Szamosszegi, founder and CEO of bitcoin mining hosting service Sazmining.
Money and energy are two of the most fundamental aspects of an economy because both are universal. Energy is required to transform raw materials into final consumer goods and services. Money is required to store wealth, calculate revenue and losses and trade for goods and services that you couldn't acquire through barter. 
Although Bitcoin drastically improves humanity's relationship with both energy and money, the problems that plague both energy and money are likely to survive a Bitcoin standard, even if they become lesser in severity. With …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just recently, the crypto community discovered a bitcointalk.org forum user who signed a message from bitcoin block 1,018, and the signer associated the signature with an address first seen in 2022. Moreover, further investigation and evidence have tied block 1,018 to the now-deceased computer scientist Hal Finney’s bitcoin transactions. Two days ago, another signature and message associated with an old bitcoin address were published, and this time around it was revealed by the ‘pharma bro’ and former hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli. The latest message makes a bold claim that says that criminal cartel boss and former programmer, Paul Le Roux, sent Hal Finney the first bitcoin transaction on Jan. 12, 2009.

PayPal has been dipping its toes steadily into the crypto waters and already offers crypto buying, selling, and holding to its customers. With another development, the company is now making it possible for users to purchase ETH directly, as well as transact on the Ethereum blockchain.
 
In a Wednesday announcement, Metamask revealed that PayPal users will soon be able to purchase Ethereum directly using the online payments platform. However, instead of having to purchase the cryptocurrency directly inside of PayPal and being unable to transfer it, the Consensys announcement said that Metamask users will actually be able to purchase the digital asset right from inside the self-custody wallet.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-ltc-near-3-week-lows-on-thursday/"/>
        <updated>2022-12-15T16:35:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin was trading close to a three-week low on Thursday, following the release of retail sales figures in the United States. Customer spending fell by more than expected in November, dropping by 0.6% last month. Litecoin slipped for a second successive session, falling to its lowest point since late November. 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) remained in the red on Thursday, as prices fell for the ninth day out of the last eleven.
 
The recent decline saw DOGE hit a low of $0.08694 earlier in today’s session, which is nearly 4% lower than Wednesday’s peak of $0.09224.
 
This move saw the meme coin fall to its lowest point since Monday, nearing a three-week low of $0.0848 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, bearish sentiment has increased as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell from its recent floor at the 47.50 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 42.40, with a floor of 40.00 the next possible destination.
 
Should this point of support be reached, we will likely see DOGE trading near the $0.0840 level.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was another notable token to fall today, with prices moving lower for a second straight day.
 
Following a high of $78.96 on Wednesday, LTC/USD dropped to a bottom of $74.07 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this drop, litecoin moved to its lowest point since November 28, when prices hit a bottom of $70.50.
 
 
Like with dogecoin above, today’s sell-off coincided with the RSI hitting a low of 50.20, which is close to a floor of 50.00.
 
Bulls anticipating a reversal may look at this with some optimism, and could look to reenter at this point of support.
 
However, should this floor fail to hold firm, then we will likely see LTC edge closer to a drop below $70.00.
