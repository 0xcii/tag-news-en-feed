Though the SEC has generally been considered to have suffered by the judgment, Stark has expressed reservations about its stability and the likelihood of appeals and reversals.
 
He advised the community to exercise caution and refrain from premature jubilation in an article that provoked thinking on July 14.
 
Stark’s viewpoint is fundamental because of his knowledge and experience in securities law. Despite its initial euphoria, he argues that the Ripple decision should not be immediately praised as a massive triumph for the cryptocurrency industry.
