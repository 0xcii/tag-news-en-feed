Bitcoin has seen a slight reversal in its ongoing rally over the last months of 2023. This price fluctuation may nevertheless suggest an upcoming bull market as the asset finds new backers.
Throughout its entire history, Bitcoin has been a wildly fluctuating asset. In the almost 15 years since the Genesis Block was mined, its greatest valuations have always come as a result of dramatic spikes, and the comedown from these highs has always been about as steep. Nevertheless, it has always shown an uncan…]]></summary>

Simply put, it's a way of doing finance using a blockchain technology system where people can interact directly without relying on traditional financial institutions. Originally linked to cryptocurrencies, DeFi has now grown beyond just digital money. It has become a game-changer by including real-world assets in its scope.
The journey of DeFi is fascinating, reflecting how blockchain tech has matured and how people are starting to realize it can shake up regular money systems. Initially, DeFi was all about using cryptocurrencies as collateral and making decentralized apps for lending, borrowing, and trading. But now, it's breaking out of that mold.

Shiba Inu Supply On Exchanges Has Plunged Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, the Shiba Inu supply on exchanges has seen a sharp drop recently. The “supply on exchanges” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating Shiba Inu supply that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric goes down, it means that the investors are transferring a net number of coins from these platforms toward their self-custodial wallets right now.
 
 
Generally, the main reason why holders would shift their coins in this way is to hold onto them for extended periods. Naturally, thi…]]></summary>

This sentiment, expressed in a two-part interview with Finance Magnates, comes in the wake of the SEC's aggressive legal actions against key players like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, despite their notable loss against Ripple. 
Gabbay's remarks reflect the growing tension between the regulatory body and the crypto industry. He added, "What's amazing is that even though they're paying for it, they go ahead and file a complaint against Kraken, which basically shows tha…]]></summary>

Sam Bankman-Fried Fraud Case Was “Unwinnable”
 
In an interview with Bloomberg, Mills said that pre-trial rulings by the judge and powerful testimony of the prosecution witnesses made the case “unwinnable” for SBF. Judge Lewis Kaplan (the Judge who oversaw the case) had made several pretrial rulings ahead of the trial, with a majority of them going against Bankman-Fried.

Judaism is based on a construct of ethical codes of conduct that are taught at weekly gatherings. Each week on Saturday mornings, Jews come together to read a weekly portion of the Torah (Old testament) to learn about the tenets of living in harmony with Jewish ethics. One of these principles is the ban on taking interest on a loan. The ban is mentioned in the weekly Torah reading Ki Tzei.
Bitcoin = the protocol and payment network.
bitcoin = the currency.
The Ban On Interest
Initially challenging for modern investors to comprehend, the ban on interest is rooted in severe consequences for non-payment in pre-biblical times, often leading to debt bondage and enslavement of the debtor and their family. This prohibition aimed to prevent such dire outcomes. The question arises: why…]]></summary>
