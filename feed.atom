        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-eth-btc-fall-to-multi-week-lows-following-us-inflation-data/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-11T12:44:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum fell below $1,800 in today’s session, as markets continued to react to the latest U.S. consumer price index. Inflation in the United States fell to 4.9% in April, less than the 5% sum many had expected. Bitcoin was also lower on the data, falling below $27,000.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dropped below $27,000 late on Wednesday, as markets reacted to the latest U.S. inflation report.
 
After an earlier high of $28,322.69, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $26,883.67 towards the close of yesterday’s session.
 
This move saw bitcoin drop to its weakest point since March 28, when price was at a low of $26,640.
 
 
Since this earlier decline in price, BTC has since rebounded, and is currently trading at $27,494.24.
 
From the chart, this appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI), which is now tracking at 41.91, and close to reentering a floor at 43.00.
 
Should this occur, there is a strong possibility that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could be back above $28,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) also fell to a multi-week low in today’s session, dropping below $1,800 in the process.
 
ETH/USD slipped to a bottom at $1,795.67 late on Wednesday, following an earlier peak of $1,886.80.
 
As a result of the sell-off, the cryptocurrency dropped to its lowest level since April 26, however price has since rebounded.
 
 
One of the catalysts for the sell-off was a breakout which took place on the RSI, which saw the index fall below 45.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 43.93, with ethereum now trading at a price of $1,824.22.
 
It appears that a crossover between the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages will likely occur, and could signal a reversal in momentum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an opinion editorial by Peter Bistoletti, a Bitcoiner who has lived in Sweden since 1971.
Sweden is the nightmare example of a state destroying financial privacy, winning the war on cash and having control of all financial transactions. Sweden has almost completely abolished anonymous cash transactions and, as a result, its regulators have control of all financial assets. Since at least 1971, when I moved to Sweden, bank assets have to be reported annually to the tax authorities, which can also demand documentation for all bank transactions. Since 2020, the Swedish police have the right by law to acquire access to locked iphones and computers by use of force. 
In such a privacy-averse environment, one should consider Bitcoin as a better alternative.

The lead singer said it was timed to give fans a chance to get comfortable with Web3 technology ahead of the group's 2023 tour, when the NFT holders can use their Deathbats for early access to tickets. M. Shadows also talked to hosts Andrew Hayward and Stephen Graves about AI and bringing Web3 into gaming.]]></summary>

But the tides started to turn because even if exploiting a smart contract nets a bigger payday than a bounty, it comes with a huge drawback. "There's a ton of risk when you engage in this, you know, wantonly criminal behavior and steal $200 million from someone else," he said. "There's no way someone's not going to come looking."]]></summary>
