        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Caught up in the storm of price action and US politics, it’s easy to forget the Bitcoin technology landscape had its own breakout earlier this year. Now that things have cooled off over the summer, next week’s Open-Source Stage at Bitcoin Nashville is a good opportunity to survey the industry’s progress.
