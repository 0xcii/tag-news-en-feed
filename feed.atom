        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jeremy Hogan, a prominent attorney in the XRP community, recently engaged in an exchange on X (formerly Twitter) about the ongoing SEC vs. Ripple case, offering insights into the potential financial repercussions for the fintech company. This discussion came in response to fellow pro-XRP attorney John E. Deaton’s comment: “The people who’ve argued that the SEC got a 50-50 victory in the Ripple case are 100% wrong. It was more like 90-10 in Ripple’s favor. If Ripple ends up paying $20M or less it’s a 99.9% legal victory.”
 
Employing his characteristic humor, Hogan likened his legal musings to resolving a marital disagreement, saying, “I was in a small argument with my wife last night, which means, I am thinking about ‘damages’ this morning.” He then shifted to discuss the legal aspects sur…]]></summary>
