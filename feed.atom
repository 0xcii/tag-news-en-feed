Not only has it transformed my worldview, but it's also reignited a fire in me to keep moving and seek out people who have gone through the same awakening.

This is due to the fourth of July Independence Day celebrations, which will see some markets in the United States closed.

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was once again in consolidation, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency remained below a key resistance level for a third straight day.
 
BTC/USD moved to a peak at $30,789.11 earlier in the day, less than 24-hours after nearing a drop below $30,000.
 
Despite the marginal gain, BTC remained below a key level of resistance at the $30,800 for the third straight session.
