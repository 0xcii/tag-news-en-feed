Hughes mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that XRP has one of the tightest monthly Bollinger Band squeezes in its history and all of the crypto market right now. The analyst noted that the XRP price rose by 60,000% the last time its Bollinger Band squeezed this much. As to how high XRP can go, Hughes mentioned that XRP hitting $250 is possible.

trial against Binance and two of its executives, Reuters reported. The judge has cited unresolved issues over medical documentation for one of the defendants. The trial,

Ongoing Medical Record Dispute
The delay arose from a medical report for Tigran  
Gambaryan ordered by the court, Binance's Head of Financial Crimes Compliance,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a strategic move influenced by upcoming general elections, South Korea has decided to delay the implementation of taxes on cryptocurrency gains until 2028. Initially, the government planned to impose a 20% tax on profits from crypto investments exceeding 2.5 million won (approximately $1,875) starting January 2023. This timeline was subsequently pushed to 2025, and now further delayed to 2028. The ruling People Power Party (PPP) argues that establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework is paramount before any taxation is enforced. This approach aims to ensure the stability and security of the crypto market, addressing its complexities and rapid evolution.

        <updated>2024-07-16T14:40:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leading Latin American crypto exchange Bitso has partnered with Lightspark to integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network onto its platform. This will introduce faster, cheaper Bitcoin transactions to Bitso's user base of over 8 million retail clients and 1,700 institutional customers.
Bitso will leverage Lightspark's infrastructure to enable Lightning transfers. Lightspark will host the nodes while Bitso retains control of the private keys in a remote signing setup.
The integration comes as Lightning Network adoption spreads globally, making payments with Bitcoin faster, smoother and less expensive.
According to Bitso's research, 53% of crypto wallets in Latin America hold Bitcoin. Trading pairs against local fiat currencies are also widely used. Thus, Lightning is a natural fit to upgrade Bitso's existing infrastructure.
Daniel Vogel, co-founder and CEO of Bitso, said, "We're thrilled to partner with Lightspark to bring Lightning to our platform. This advances our mission of making crypto useful by delivering faster, more cost-effective, and transparent money transfers."
With Lightning, Bitso can offer near-instant Bitcoin transactions at a fraction of the cost of regular on-chain Bitcoin payments. This unlocks new potential payment and remittance solutions for both retail and enterprise clients.
Lightspark CEO David Marcus said Bitso "shares our vision of building open payments for the Internet. This gets us closer to that goal. We know people across Latin America want this solution."
As a pioneering Latin American exchange with millions of users, Bitso's integration of Lightning is a milestone in increasing Bitcoin adoption.]]></summary>
