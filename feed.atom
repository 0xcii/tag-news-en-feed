        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The bitcoin market, notorious for its rollercoaster-like volatility, has once again plunged into a tumultuous phase, leaving traders and investors on edge as prices oscillate unpredictably. 
 
Crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen, a prominent voice in the digital asset arena, has declared that the market is now entering one of its most “brutal” stages within its cyclical nature.
 
 
Cowen, sharing his insights on the social media platform X, pointed out that Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance, which represents its total share of the crypto market capitalization, is on the rise. This phenomenon comes as risk appetite for the broader asset class appears to be waning.
 
“We’ve been discussing this phase of the market cycle for a while,” Cowen wrote. “Namely, where BTC drops, but BTC dominance (BTC.D) goes…]]></summary>

Alameda Minted $39.55B of USDT
 
On-chain data gathered by Grogan revealed that the trading firm minted $39.55 Billion worth of USDT, a figure said to account for “475 of Tether’s circulating supply today.” According to data from CoinMarketCap, Tether’s circulating supply currently stands at 83,494,944,358 USDT.
 
 
While a previous report had estimated the total number of USDT, which Alameda minted, at $36.7 Billion, Grogan was able to come up with the additional figures with the additional wallets he found on-chain.

To the end, Robin Linus, the leader of ZeroSync, which is behind the development of a zk-proof light client for Bitcoin, unveiled the “BitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin” white paper yesterday. This paper presents a groundbreaking methodology that could potentially redefine the perception of Bitcoin’s capabilities.
 
BitVM introduces a computing paradigm that can express Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts. The significance here is that it does not necessitate any modifications to the network’s consensus rules. Instead of executing computations directly on Bitcoin, these computations are merely verified, drawing parallels with the process of optimistic rollups.

Historically, about 800 fiat currencies have come and gone, with many ultimately failing. Intriguingly, the fundamental reasons for establishing the fiat system remain elusive to many. Some argue that it was designed by governments to perpetuate corruption and fund endless global conflicts. In a nutshell, most fiat currencies have either supported military pursuits or protected financial magnates who benefit from such endeavors.
