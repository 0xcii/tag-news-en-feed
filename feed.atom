        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nigerian crypto platform Bitmama is reportedly set to acquire the African remittances startup Payday for $1 million. Reports of Payday’s acquisition come almost a year after the startup raised $3 million in a funding round. 
 
Bitmama’s Pivot From Crypto
 
The Nigerian crypto platform Bitmama is set to acquire the cross-border payment startup Payday for a reported sum of $1 million. The acquisition deal, which puts Payday’s value at $30 million, allows Bitmama to broaden its product offering to include cross-border remittances without having to start this service from scratch.
 
According to a Dec. 5 Techcabal report, Bitmama’s yet-to-be-consumated acquisition deal comes nearly a year after the previously high-flying Payday successfully raised $3 million in a funding round. Commenting on the deal, Favour Ori, founder and CEO of Payday, said:
 
“The deal is a work in progress. If the deal goes through, the result will be a strong team with much more efficiency.”
 

 
When the deal is finalized, Bitmama is expected to take over Payday’s customer deposits and the remittance firm’s liabilities.
 
Ruth Iselema, who founded Bitmama in 2019, explained how her platform’s pivot away from its crypto-only approach convinced Ori to approach. She also suggested that Bitmama’s desire to become a leading remittance service provider made the deal to buy Payday even more lucrative.
 
Meanwhile, Payday’s downfall may be linked to the founder’s extravagance and brash management style as well as the company’s failure to effectively deal with customer complaints, according to reports.

93% Of Bitcoin Supply Already Mined
 
The total mined Bitcoin crossed 19 million back in 2022 and the figure has continually risen since then. Then in December 2023, the total percentage of the total BTC supply that has been mined crossed the 93% threshold, and Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, took to Twitter to share this milestone.
 
 
According to data from Blockchain.com, a total of 19,560,877.158 BTC has been mined as of December 5. This means that between April 2022 and December 2023, less than 600 BTC were brought into circul…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-chain governance changes how decisions are made in decentralized systems. Unlike traditional ways involving discussions off the blockchain, on-chain governance uses the blockchain for decision-making. This process is done through smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements. 
 In on-chain governance, decisions and voting are programmed into smart contracts, making the entire process transparent and recorded on the unchangeable blockchain. This method aligns with decentralization, where power isn't held by a few individuals but distributed among the participants. This decentralization reduces the risks of central control and strengthens the security of blockchain networks.

 Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world with around $9.4 trillion in AUM, doesn’t appear to pull any punches when it comes to speaking his mind.  In 2017, Fink dismissed crypto as an “index of money laundering.” But just three years later the BlackRock CEO admitted that assets like Bitcoin had caught his attention.  
 “I do believe the role of crypto is it’s digitizing gold in many ways,” Fink said in a recent interview with Fox Business, while also referring to BTC as an “international asset.”  Today, BlackRock is geari…]]></summary>

The Spot Bitcoin ETF Factor
 
According to a study conducted by the crypto platform Bybit, the bitcoin held by INS saw an “almost twofold increase in their Bitcoin holding percentage” during the initial three quarters of 2023. The study report suggests that the accumulation trends by these traders depict a pattern which is distinct from that of VIP and retail traders.

In the interview, Warren stated that “there is a new threat out there, and it is crypto.” The senator’s assertion is apparently due to the risk of criminal activities that cryptocurrency poses.

As part of the agreement, Phoenix Group PLC will receive mining equipment valued at $136 million, with an additional option worth $246 million.

Bijan Alizadehfard, the co-founder and CEO of Phoenix Group PLC, described the collaboration with Microbt as a reflection of his company’s strategic foresight.
 
“This collaboration with Whatsminer [Microbt] is a milestone for Phoenix Group, reflecting our strategic foresight and commitment to pioneering in the tech industry. Our successful listing on the ADX has further empowered us to pursue such significant partnerships, enhancing our capabilities in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector,” Alizadehfard said.
