        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On August 16, 2023, the Shiba Inu meme coin enthusiasts celebrated the unveiling of the second-layer (L2) blockchain, Shibarium. This platform is designed to bolster decentralized app growth while tackling Ethereum’s scalability and transaction fee challenges. Yet, even amidst the celebrations, SHIB, the project’s native cryptocurrency, slid over 8% against the U.S. dollar, mirroring the larger crypto market’s decline. Adding to the concerns, complications arose with the Shibarium bridge, leaving roughly $1.7 million in ether seemingly in a state of suspension.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The global rise of crypto has opened new opportunities for innovation, investment, and unfortunately, cybercrime. As the decentralized world grapples with the consequences of its rapid growth, another shadowy figure emerges on the horizon.
 
North Korea, an enigmatic nation, has since been suspected of orchestrating extensive cyber heists, primarily focusing on the digital asset sector. A recent report indicates that North Korean hackers have pilfered roughly $180 million worth of crypto within just the first six months of this year.
 
A Growing Threat To Crypto Security
 
South Korea’s National Intelligence Service unveiled these alarming figures during a press briefing, which were subsequently reported by Asia Today, a prominent local news agency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soft money is considered through two different concepts. Firstly and generally speaking, it’s a type of money, like paper currency or fiat money, that stands in contrast with hard money. Hard money has physicality, like gold, silver or any other metal-coined money, or it is hard coded to be scarce, like bitcoin. 
Soft currency is often used instead of soft money, they are interchangeable in the economic sense as they both refer to a currency that is not backed by a tangible commodity and whose value is based on government regulation and public confidence. The only nuanced difference is that soft currencies are often associated with countries that have weak or unstable economies, high inflation rates, or political turmoil.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin extended recent declines on Thursday, as the cryptocurrency moved towards a two-month low. Bearish sentiment increased following the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, where the Federal Reserve hinted at further rate hikes. Ethereum fell below $1,800 today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) neared a two-month low during today’s session, as traders continued to react to the latest FOMC minutes report.
 
Following a high of $29,192.26 on hump-day, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $28,376.50 earlier in the day.
 
This was the weakest point that bitcoin had fallen to since June 21, when it was at a low of $28,271.
 
 
The drop comes as a recent upwards crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages has reversed course.
 
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) has plunged deeper into oversold territory, and is now tracking at 35.05.
 
This is its lowest level since March, and should momentum continue to fall, price could end up at a floor of $27,600.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Bearish sentiment was also high in ethereum (ETH), which fell to a multi-month low of its own on Thursday.
 
ETH/USD bottomed out at $1,783.05 on Thursday, less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $1,826.82.
 
As a result of this sell-off, ethereum slipped to its lowest point since June 20, when it almost moved under the $1,700 mark.
 
 
Ethereum’s RSI is also currently hovering in bear territory, with a reading at 33.67, and appears to be angling to reach a floor at 30.00.
 
Should it reach this point, ethereum will likely be trading around a long-term support point of $1,750.

The central question emerges: Is SEC chair Gary Gensler sharing an undisclosed affiliation with an organization opposing the spot Bitcoin ETF?
 
Castle Island Ventures General Partner Matt Walsh drew attention to an opposition letter on the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF proposal sent to the SEC by independent organization Better Markets, Inc. The contents of the letter have the potential to cause an uproar in the Bitcoin community. According to Walsh, the letter contains “questionable, if not outright false, claims about how the spot and futures markets for Bitcoin work today.”

When it comes to doing stupid things, we all have had our own experiences, but few mistakes are as costly as the ones made with Bitcoin. Over the years, I have seen friends lose chunks of BTC due to some avoidable mistakes and, I dare say, I myself have not been immune to that either. 
It is estimated that around 3.7 million BTC has been lost over the years thanks to blunders, misadventures and circumstances of all sorts. That accounts for nearly 20% of all currently-minted bitcoin, and that number of lost BTC keeps growing. In this article, I will share some of the crazier stories that I have heard, experienced, embellished or concocted to illustrate how one might lose their holdings and what you can do to …]]></summary>

On May 2, the company was fined AED 10,000,000 ($2.7 million) by the regulator. OPNX’s founders – Kyle Davies, Su Zhu, and Mark Lamb – weren’t spared, as VARA issued a fine of AED 200,000 ($54,500) against each of them. The company’s CEO, Leslie Lamb, was also fined the aforementioned sum.
