Ethereum Exchange Netflows Have Been Positive Recently
 
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the ETH Exchange Netflow has been positive recently. The “Exchange Netflow” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the net amount of Ethereum that’s flowing into or out of the wallets connected to centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric is positive, it means the investors are depositing a net number of tokens into these platforms. As one of the main reasons holders may transfer their coins to the exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this trend can be bearish for the asset’s price.
