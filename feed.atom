As the 2024 election approaches, Trump’s pro-crypto stance has gained significant attention, reflected in the betting odds on prediction markets like Polymarket, where he is currently favored to win.
 
Polymarket Favors Donald Trump As ‘Crypto President’
 
Trump’s pledge to end the so-called “war on crypto” has resonated with many disillusioned by the current administration’s policies. Additionally, his acceptance of campaign donations in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin demonstrates his embrace of this emerging asset class.

“The financial world now believes Bitcoin is a fast emerging asset class,” says Woo. At present, though, the coin only has a total market cap of around $1.2 trillion, while the analyst notes that asset classes are generally valued in “units of tens of trillion.”
