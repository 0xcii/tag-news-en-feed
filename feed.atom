        <updated>2023-08-30T15:38:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin cash (BCH) was one of Wednesday’s biggest gainers, as markets remained jubilant following the Grayscale court ruling. Following a recent streak of consolidation, the global crypto market cap rose by as much as 4% on the news. toncoin (TON) also surged, climbing nearly 16% higher.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was a notable gainer on Wednesday, as the price was once again trading above the $200 level. BCH/USD peaked at $227.03 late on Tuesday’s session, following a low at $192.77 earlier in the day.
 
The move saw the price breakout out of a resistance level of $225.00, hitting a two-week high in the process.
 
 
As of writing this, earlier gains have since eased, with the cryptocurrency once again trading below the aforementioned ceiling.
 
This came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with its own resistance level at 60.00. In the event bulls manage to orchestrate a breakout, BCH will likely be above $240.00.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
For a second straight session, toncoin (TON) surged considerably higher, with today’s gains seeing a price jump of over 12%.
 
Following a low of $1.52 on Tuesday, TON/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $1.75 earlier in today’s session. This resulted in the cryptocurrency climbing to its highest point since June 5, when the price was at $1.77.
 
 
After peaking at 70.41 less than 24 hours ago, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 75.38.
 
Many now expect an upcoming reversal, due to TON being highly overbought, as a result of this recent bull run.

        <updated>2023-08-30T15:35:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the evolving Bitcoin market, stories of missed opportunities and astonishing deals abound – however, few are as eye-popping as this sale from August 30, 2010. 
Unearthed by Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo, a BitcoinTalk thread shows how an early Bitcoin user amassed 30,000 BTC, only to sell them for $0.03 each. 
Then sold below market price, roughly $0.06 at the time, the sale netted $900. The same amount of Bitcoin, if sold today, would be worth over $810,000,000. 
 
         
         
         
         
    
While few could have predicted the meteoric rise of Bitcoin to $27,000 in the years to come, it seems the seller in this case might have been motivated by an interest in disproving that the cryptocurrency would work at all. 
Though there is only speculation in the thread, it shows that market participants at the time believed the seller to be William “Nenolod” Pitcock, a data center employee who is said to have amassed close to 100,000 BTC that he liquidated in 2010. 
Speaking about another sale in July, he discussed his motivation was to spark a “bank rush,” writing: “The purpose was to demonstrate in two ways that the Bitcoin system can be attacked… [and] cause speculation in the bitcoin economy.”
While no connection between the events can be substantiated, the thread, buried in the archives of an early Bitcoin user forum, serves as a time capsule, transporting readers back to a moment when the true potential of Bitcoin was still shrouded in uncertainty.
While some may view it as a painful reminder of missed opportunities, others see it as a testament to the enduring allure that Bitcoin has created over the years.
Either wary, thanks to the sale, some lucky Bitcoiners were able to get bids filled at once-in-a-lifetime prices.]]></summary>

Today, Cason stands not only as an educator but also as a philosopher delving deep into the transformative potential of Bitcoin. It is with this expertise that Erik Cason announces the release of his first book “Cryptosovereignty” being published through Bitcoin Magazine Books.

        <updated>2023-08-30T13:27:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin climbed over the $28,000 level late on Tuesday, as markets reacted to the news that Grayscale had won its battle with the SEC. The ruling over the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission boosted crypto prices across the board, with bulls returning to action. Ethereum also surged, moving above $1,700. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin moved back over the $28,000 level during the last several hours, following Grayscale’s court win over the Securities and Exchanges Commission.
 
After trading at a low of $25,998.08 earlier in the day, BTC/USD peaked at $28,089.34 late on Tuesday.
 
This pushed the world’s largest cryptocurrency to its highest point since August 17, when price was on the cusp on $29,000.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Earlier gains have since fallen, as traders have seemingly captured profits, with bitcoin now trading at $27,353.52.
 
From the chart, this comes as the relative strength index (RSI), reached a ceiling of 53.00, before falling lower.
 
As of writing this, the index is now tracking at 48.52.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) bulls made an appearance over the past 24-hours, pushing price above $1,700 in the process.
 
ETH/USD rose to an intraday high of $1,742.64 during Tuesday’s session, after trading by as much as $100.00 lower earlier in the day.
 
Like with BTC, this saw ethereum move to its highest level in almost two-weeks, and close to a resistance level of $1,750.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
This rally has since lost momentum, with price strength running into a wall at the 49.00 mark, and is now at a reading of 46.85.
 
A floor of 41.00 now awaits, in the event bulls continue to capture recent profits, giving way to bears to reenter.
