        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past year, bitcoin’s price has declined by about 60% from its all-time high. This has diminished the excitement surrounding the alpha coin, but not entirely.
 
There are still many who have faith in the cryptocurrency’s future. One of them is Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers.
 
Rogers, a Republican, has presented legislation that would make bitcoin legal currency in Arizona and allow state agencies to accept it.
 
The law proposed on Wednesday would, if passed, make Arizona the first state in the United States to recognize bitcoin as a legal form of currency.
 
The proposals are co-sponsored by Rogers’ Republican colleagues in the state senate, J.D. Mesnard and Jeff Weninger.

Critics cite the original distribution of XRP to Ripple on the one hand and the functionality of the XRP ledger on the other. Back in May 2017, Ripple announced a strategy to increase decentralization and ensure that no single entity has operational control over the XRP Ledger.
