        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robinhood has announced a share repurchase agreement  
worth $605.7 million with the US Marshal Service (USMS) to regain control of  
shares previously held by Same Bankman-Fried (SBF)’s Emergent Fidelity  
Technologies. This move comes after a series of legal events that began when  
SBF, just six months before his empire collapsed, disclosed a 7.6% stake in  
Robinhood.
The shares in question  
had been seized and subsequently transferred into the custody of the US  
government after Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, and Emergent  
filed for bankruptcy protection in 2022. Reacting to the latest development,  
Robinhood's shares surged by more than 3% in pre-market trading as news of the  
buyback broke.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The XRP price is down today after seeing an encouraging start to the week. This decline has now seen the altcoin wipe out the vast majority of its gains from Ripple’s triumph over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) back in July. So the question now is, what is driving the XRP price down today?
 
XRP Price Falls To Pre-Victory Levels
 
The XRP price is down 4.08% in the last day, as shown by data from coin tracker CoinMarketCap. This decline makes XRP one of the highest losers in the top 10 over the last day, suggesting that there could be unique drivers behind the price decline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) and the entire cryptocurrency market are currently caught in a sideways trading pattern, leaving investors grappling with uncertainty. In a market where prices can swing dramatically in a matter of minutes, such stability can be unsettling for traders. 
 
However, renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe, known for his insightful predictions, offers a glimmer of hope to those who have been “hodling” through these turbulent times. He anticipates a substantial payoff for patient investors in the next one to two years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Litecoin was down by as much as 5% during Friday’s session, as markets reacted to the nonfarm payrolls report from the United States. 187,000 jobs were added to the economy in August, compared to the revised sum of 157,000 in July. Bitcoin cash also slipped, extending recent losses.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was a notable mover in today’s session, as the token fell by as much as 5% on Friday.
 
Following a peak at $67.41 on Thursday, LTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $63.49 earlier in the day.
 
The move resulted in litecoin falling below a support point at $63.50, with bulls unable to prevent this breakout.
 
 
This decline comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) retreated to a support point of its own at 30.00.
 
Price strength is generally overbought, which could be an overall positive for longer-term bulls, who are looking to capitalize on the current dip.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 29.62, with LTC at $63.31.
 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was also trending lower today, as the price also plunged by over 5% earlier in the day.
 
After a recent three-day losing streak, BCH/USD dropped to an intraday low of $204.28 on Friday.
 
This comes following Thursday’s peak at the $219.46 level, which was close to a ceiling of $225.00, which bulls were unable to penetrate earlier in the week.
 
 
Now that it appears that sentiment has shifted bearish, a target of $190.00 appears to be where sellers are hoping to exit.
 
In order to get there, they will need to push the RSI from a current level of 46.81 to its next visible floor at 39.00.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) has revised its Bitcoin electricity consumption estimates, addressing longstanding concerns about the accuracy of its Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI). The new study, titled “Bitcoin electricity consumption: an improved assessment,” dated August 31, 2023, has ignited discussions among crypto enthusiasts and environmentalists alike.
 
Cambridge Revises Down False Bitcoin Energy Estimates
 
Daniel Batten, a prominent climate activist and Bitcoin environmental analyst, was quick to weigh in on the matter. He tweeted, “Cambridge have just updated their Bitcoin power/energy consumption methodology. It’s decreased around 25% and is now looking much more accurate. My model says 13.095 GW. Very similar to Cambridge now.”

Currently, the network’s hashrate is about 367.58 exahash per second (EH/s), with an average of 380.90 EH/s over the past ten days.
 
After a Rocky Month, Bitcoin Miners Poised for Potential Difficulty Decrease
 
Bitcoin miners have faced challenges recently because the price of BTC dropped last month and the difficulty increased twice, totaling a 6.29% rise. The adjustment on Aug. 22 set the difficulty to a record 55.62 trillion. With five days remaining until the next adjustment, projections suggest miners might see a decrease in the upcoming period. Data from two independent sources indicates a potential decline of 4.42% to 4.9%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin plummeted below $26,000 to start the month of September, as markets waited for the latest non-farm payrolls (NFP) report. Payrolls in the United States were expected to fall to 170,000 for August, however came in at 187,000. Ethereum was also down on the news, falling below $1,700.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin slipped below the $26,000 level on Friday, prior to the release of August’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.
 
BTC/USD dropped to a low of $25,752 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after peaking at $27,456.
 
This drop caps off an extremely volatile week for bitcoin, which was trading above $28,000 three days ago.

As a result of this latest sell-off, the world’s largest cryptocurrency closed in on a key price floor of $25,600.
 
Despite strong gains earlier this week, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) was unable to break out of a ceiling at 53.00.
 
This triggered previous bulls to instead secure their profits, liquidating earlier positions in the process.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 38.58, however price is now back above $26,000, following the NFP report.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) remained in the red during today’s session, falling below $1,700 in the process.
 
After reaching a high of $1,720 on Thursday, ETH/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,634 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this price dive, ethereum briefly fell below a recent support level of $1,650.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Similar to BTC, this recent spell of downward pressure comes as the RSI failed to move above a key resistance threshold.
 
The index is now at a reading of 38.05, a few days removed from a collision with a ceiling at 49.00.
 
In the event momentum continues to tumble, the next price target will be $1,600.
