        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new link between the Central American nation and Texas has been borne out of Bitcoin.
After opening its first Bitcoin Embassy in Lugano, Switzerland, El Salvador is opening a second one in Texas.



According to a tweet from El Salvador’s Ambassador to the United States, Milena Mayorga, a meeting took place between her, other representatives of El Salvador and the Deputy Secretary of the Government of Texas, Joe Esparza.
“We discussed the opening of the second Bitcoin embassy and the expansion of commercial and economic exchange projects,” Mayorga said, also noting that “In 2022, El Salvador and the State of Texas had a commercial exchange of $1,244,636,983.”
Much of the Texas government has been publicly pro-Bitcoin as of late, and this is one step further in its involvement in the industry. El Salvador became the first sovereign country in the world to make bitcoin legal tender, making history while simultaneously challenging the fiat status quo. 
Since then, the country has made moves to create the first bitcoin-backed sovereign debt bonds as well as hosting a successful conference, and is home to many projects entirely powered by Bitcoin. Just as the establishment of its Switzerland embassy was a step forward for El Salvador, this meeting between the country’s Ambassador and representatives of the Government of Texas is another milestone in its adoption of Bitcoin.]]></summary>

Following the recent saga between Paxos, the issuer of the Binance branded stablecoin BUSD, and the Security Exchange Commission (SEC), the stablecoin market has been bewildered. Investors sought the safest-backed stablecoin to save their funds. 
 
According to Binance Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as “CZ,”  the cryptocurrency industry may soon evolve away from the ubiquitous dollar-backed stablecoin era to stablecoins that are algorithmically backed by other assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Blur non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace launched its native token this week, and users who were awarded token allotments received “care packages.” Blur tokens began trading at noon on Feb. 14, reaching a high of $5.02 per token. However, the coin has since dropped more than 85% against the U.S. dollar.
 
BLUR Token Launch Records an 85% Drop on Its First Day of Trading
 
On Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2023, which is Valentine’s Day, the NFT marketplace Blur announced the launch of its token and airdrop. Blur gave away “care packages” to users who conducted trades on a competing NFT market, listed NFTs on the Blur marketplace, and those who participated in Blur market bidding, according to the allotment cycles.
 
“It’s time for BLUR,” the market tweeted the day prior. “Care Packages can be opened on Feb 14 at 12PM EST, 1AM HKG, 6PM CET. Make sure the launch announcement comes from our official Blur.io account tomorrow and double check all URLs before claiming.”
 
 
BLUR has started trading, with Kucoin being the most active exchange on Tuesday, and the most active trading pair being BLUR/USDT. As of 2:05 p.m. (ET), BLUR had a market capitalization of approximately $176 million, with a global trade volume of about $12 million. At 2:10 p.m., BLUR dropped to $0.458 per coin, and statistics indicate that there are 360,000,000 BLUR tokens in circulation.
 
 
As of 2:10 p.m. (ET) on Tuesday, there were 8,798 unique addresses holding BLUR tokens, with approximately 18,900 transfers having taken place. The Blur marketplace has emerged as a top NFT market in recent months, competing with Opensea, the largest NFT market.
 
However, Looksrare, another competing NFT market, also garnered attention with an airdrop of its market’s token called LOOKS, but volumes have subsided since then. By 2:33 p.m. on Tuesday, BLUR rebounded and hit the $0.602 per unit range.
