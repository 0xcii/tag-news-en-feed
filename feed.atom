        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kraken Exchange’s decision to delist Monero (XMR) sent shockwaves across the cryptocurrency space. Trading and deposits for Monero in the European Economic Area (EEA) will be shut off before the end of October, 2024. Increasing regulatory scrutiny was cited as a reason for the move. The pressure has dragged the coin’s price below $150, showing that privacy-focused cryptocurrencies still face a lot of setbacks.
 
 
The Price Decline
 
Monero has also not been spared in the rollercoaster ride in terms of price. Days before the Kraken delisting announcement, it was hovering around $158, failing to maintain its footing amidst a broader bearish trend that has eaten up much of the cryptocurrencies’ value.
 

 
The news of the delisting has just aggravated the decline: XMR plummeted over 10% shor…]]></summary>

Notably, Dogecoin, which ended the last days of September on a bullish run, has since reversed those gains and is back where it left off just above $0.10. 
 
According to a technical analysis of the Dogecoin price action, the meme coin broke above a multi-month downtrend last week. However, as it stands, a recent correction in the past 48 hours has seen DOGE reversing to retest the breakout point. As noted by a crypto analyst, this retest is crucial to DOGE’s performance in the coming weeks and months. A bounce or a break below could make or break the meme coin’s price.
