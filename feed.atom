        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Judge Lewis Kaplan, the presiding judge in Sam  
Bankman-Fried’s case, has unveiled a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates who  
will be sworn in, marking the beginning of a trial that has garnered  
significant attention. 
The U.S. Prosecutors have filed multiple charges of fraud  
and conspiracy against Bankman-Fried following the collapse of his  
crypto-trading platform, FTX. Prosecutors allege that the 31-year-old  
entrepreneur misappropriated approximately $8 billion in customer funds. These  
funds were purportedly used to cover high-risk bets made by his crypto hedge  
fund, acquire luxury real estate in the Bahamas, and make substantial  
contributions to U.S. political campaigns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) enthusiasts have long harbored a fervent aspiration: to see the meme coin achieve the elusive one-cent mark. While the current SHIB price, standing at $0.00000726 according to CoinGecko, might seem far away from this dream, the community remains steadfast in its hope.
 
A quick glance at the recent price trends reveals SHIB’s uphill battle. Over the last 24 hours, the token has experienced a minor decline of 0.4%, despite a modest seven-day price gain of 0.6%.

To reach $0.01, SHIB would need an astronomical surge. The exponential price increase required underscores the enormous challenge ahead. The community’s determination to achieve this re…]]></summary>

Prosecutors said in a new court filing that SBF should not be allowed to claim he’s innocent because cryptocurrency exchanges faced little regulation. They also argued he can’t use his compliance with U.S. laws as proof of good faith.
 
Prosecutors Seek to Limit SBF’s Defense Arguments About Regulations
 
In the Wednesday letter, federal prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan to reconsider or clarify a recent order limiting trial evidence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon surged to its strongest level since the end of August, as the token extended recent gains. The rally comes despite cryptocurrencies mostly consolidating on Wednesday, following recent declines. XRP was another notable gainer today.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) rose for a back-to-back session on Wednesday, hitting a multi-week high in the process.
 
MATIC/USD moved to an intraday high of $0.5937 in today’s session, which comes following a low of $0.5523 the day before.
 
This resulted in polygon climbing to its highest point since August 29, when the price peaked at $0.6355.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge saw the relative strength index (RSI) rise past a ceiling at the 62.00 zone.
 
Currently, the index is now at a reading of 62.76, with an upcoming resistance level at the 70.00 point.
 
A crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages also seems to be one of the reasons for today’s rally.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP was another big mover on Wednesday, as the price attempted to break out of a key resistance level.
 
After Tuesday’s low at $0.5075, XRP/USD rallied to an intraday high of $0.5449 during today’s session.
 
As a result of this surge, the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency briefly rose past a ceiling at $0.5400.
 
 
Earlier gains have since edged lower, which comes as the RSI fell below a ceiling at the 62.00 mark.
 
The index has since dropped further, and is now tracking at 56.57, and seems to be heading towards a floor of 51.00.

It all began with the discovery that Alameda held a

If Recession, Then Not Inflation
Last week, I wrote about the Fed Funds Futures curve, concluding rate cuts will likely start in the middle of next year, giving bitcoin plenty of room to rally through the halving season. That analysis is based on the high probability that a recession is coming, which does not match with the common belief that inflation is heating back up. Today, I want to discuss a couple common paradoxes to clear up that disconnect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It appears financial services giant Block is closer to going public with its first Bitcoin hardware wallet product.
Teased yesterday by a beta tester, the images offer a first glimpse of Block's new Bitcoin hardware wallet, first announced in 2022, and reveal a small hexagon-shaped device complete with a fingerprint censor, which adds an extra layer of biometric security to the device.
The unveiling comes on the heels of several hints and teasers from Block, the financial services company co-founded by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. 
Block's entry into the hardware wallet market comes at a time when Bitcoin security and self-custody is of paramount importance, as evidenced by the ongoing trial of disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
Bankman-Fried's mismanagement of the exchange contributed to the loss of billions worth of customer crypto, funds that otherwise would have been unaffected had users had control of the private keys for these assets.
In previous reports, Dorsey has hinted at the company's vision for the hardware wallet, emphasizing the importance of allowing customers to maintain full control over their Bitcoin holdings. The device is expected to align with this philosophy, allowing users to securely manage their Bitcoin assets independently. 
To that end, Block's hardware wallet is anticipated to be competitively priced, ensuring that more individuals can participate in the crypto ecosystem without breaking the bank. Hardware wallets today typically retail for between $50 and $100, though prices vary depending on the make and model.



While the initial image of the hardware wallet offers a tantalizing glimpse of what's to come, the Bitcoin community eagerly awaits further details, including its release date, pricing, and additional features. 
Block's venture into the hardware wallet space is poised to make a significant impact, further solidifying the company's position as a key player.]]></summary>
