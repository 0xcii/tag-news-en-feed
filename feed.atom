What DOGE Day Is All About
 
DOGE Day, celebrated on April 20, is earmarked to promote and reaffirm the values of the foremost meme coin launched in 2013. The meme coin, which was created as a “joke,” has continued to make a statement in the crypto market, and this journey is usually celebrated during DOGE Day.
 
 
Meanwhile, despite DOGE attaining this level of prominence, its community has always ensured the preservation of the crypto token’s goofy nature. As such, it is no surprise that DOGE Day is also on the same day as the one meant t…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-04-01T13:58:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitkub Capital Group Holdings, the parent company of  
Thailand's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has announced plans to go public in  
2025. The company has hired financial for the impending transition. 
According to a recent interview quoted by Bloomberg,  
Bitkub’s CEO, Jirayut Srupsrisopa, unveiled the ambitious strategy. Srupsrisopa  
noted that the company will be listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand to enhance  
its visibility and raise capital for business expansion. 
Competition Intensifies in Southeast Asia
As Bitkub prepares for its IPO, competition in  
Southeast Asia's crypto market is heating up. Rivals such as Binance and  
Kasikornbank Pcl have been actively vying for market share, intensifying the  
competition landscape. The surge in active crypto trading accounts in  
Thailand, reaching 238,000 in March, reflects the growing interest and  
participation in the sector.
Bitkub is ramping up its workforce, aiming to increase  
its headcount to 3,000 by 2025 in anticipation of the IPO. Despite regulatory  
challenges, including the scrapping of a proposed acquisition by SCB X Pcl,  
Bitkub is eying expansion in Southeast Asia. 
Last year, Bitkub's sale of its stake in Bitkub Online  
Co. boosted the exchange's valuation. Bitkub Online accounts for a significant  
portion of Bitkub Capital's earnings. Thus, the company expects a growth in  
trading volumes following this transaction.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

These new financial instruments attracted a massive inflow of over $12 billion in just three months, currently holding a significant 4.20% share of all bitcoins.
 
Recent trends raise questions about their short-term impact and highlight the complex dynamics at play in the crypto market.
 
 
The initial surge in ETF investment was attributed to their ease of access for mainstream investors. Unlike traditional methods like crypto exchanges, ETFs offer a familiar trading platform and potentially lower fees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Polygon Labs Marc Boiron, has expressed a negative sentiment towards layer 3 (L3) networks, arguing the necessity and implications of the solutions for scaling Ethereum – the second largest cryptocurrency asset.
 
Polygon CEO Claims Layer 3 Devalues Ethereum
 
In a heated conversation on the X platform, Marc Boiron claimed that these layer 3 networks pose a potential risk to the value of Ethereum. The Polygon CEO asserted that the major purpose of  L3s is to devalue ETH and the layer 2s that serve as the foundation for layer 3s.
 
As a result, Boiron believes that layer 3 is not required to scale Ethereum. Since L3 networks are not required to scale current networks, Boiton has declared that Polygon Labs will not operate on the networks.

        <link href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tether-8888-btc-600-million-bitcoin-treasury-on-chain-data"/>
        <updated>2024-04-01T10:53:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stablecoin issuer Tether has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 8,888 BTC worth around $600 million. This latest purchase was revealed through on-chain data rather than an official announcement.
Tether has not publicly disclosed its Bitcoin addresses. However, transactions tracked on the blockchain show 8,888 BTC were recently sent from the crypto exchange Bitfinex to an undisclosed Tether wallet.
The recipient address now holds over 75,000 BTC worth $5.3 billion. In May 2023, Tether first revealed it was allocating a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin, with plans to invest up to 15% of quarterly profits.
"The decision to invest in bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset," Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, said in the statement when they announced their Bitcoin strategy.
While unconfirmed, analysts believe the identified wallet likely belongs to Tether. The amount perfectly matches its pledged buying strategy and claimed holdings in its latest financial reports.
Tether has emerged as a major player in Bitcoin markets and its accumulation race. The company is now estimated to be the seventh largest holder of BTC. Its steady purchases, combined with those of institutional investors like MicroStrategy, tighten supply.
Critics have raised concerns about Tether's lack of transparency and the potential market risks of its growing bitcoin stash. However, its embrace of Bitcoin also shows the asset's broadening mainstream acceptance.
Tether aims to capitalize on Bitcoin's growth while diversifying its reserves away from traditional assets like government debt. Tether is one of the world's largest holders of U.S. Treasuries. 
This latest $600 million acquisition is unlikely to be Tether's last. As the stablecoin leader continues executing its Bitcoin investment strategy, its influence over Bitcoin markets is only set to increase.]]></summary>
