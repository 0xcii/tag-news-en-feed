FTX Creditors Sift Through Offers for Exchange’s Possible Reawakening
 
Throughout the year, whispers of FTX’s potential revival have surfaced approximately four times. During his first interview post-FTX collapse in January 2023, FTX’s restructuring head, CEO John J. Ray III, hinted at a resurgence. In a subsequent April hearing, the topic resurfaced. By mid-June, murmurs of “FTX 2.0” were in the air, and with each whisper, the value of FTX’s native crypto asset FTT spikes.

        <updated>2023-10-25T19:36:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin has risen over 110% in 2023 at the time of writing, where the price of the asset started the year off at $16,677 on January 1, has now pumped to above $35,000 only 10 months later. With more room to run this year as hype builds in the market around the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC and the upcoming halving event, many are now questioning if this is the end of this cycle's eventful bear market.
Since the few disastrous incidents that happened in the bear market causing the price drop, things are now looking more optimistic. As some of the worlds largest asset managers, including Fidelity, VanEck and WisdomTree, have filed in hopes to be the first in the United States to get approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. One name in particular though is making more headlines than the rest, and that is the worlds largest asset manger BlackRock, who manages about $10 trillion.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently made an appearance on Fox Business stating that their clients around the world are interested in getting exposure to Bitcoin, saying the recent price rally has been a "flight to quality." Earlier this month, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their approval odds for a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC to 90% by January 10, 2024.



The next Bitcoin having is expected to take place in roughly 180 days in late April, 2024. The event will see the Bitcoin block reward drop from 6.25 BTC per block to only 3.125 BTC. This will be the fourth halving in Bitcoin's history, with the first happening in November 2012, the second happened in July 2016, and the third happened in May 2020. Historically, a year leading up to and after the halving, the price of BTC goes up substantially.]]></summary>

Back’s comment arrives during a period of significant market turbulence triggered by the abrupt removal of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust from the listing of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, sending ripples through the crypto community.

This presents an issue when it comes to the changing balances of channels over time as they are routing payments between numerous different users across the network, once a sender "locks in" and decides on a specific route, that route cannot be changed until a failure message makes it way back to the sender, allowing them to construct an entirely new route going around the point where the initial attempt failed.

There are two phases of the indicator: a 9 candle setup phase and a 13 candle countdown phase. The former of these starts when the price observes a flip and continues until the ninth candle is hit. At that point, the price hits a bottom or a top (depending on the surrounding price trend).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ex-FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried is slated to make his case directly to the jury in his ongoing trial, as shared by his defense lawyer, Mark Cohen. Bankman-Fried’s decision to testify comes on the heels of several witnesses who have spoken against him in recent weeks.
 
Facing Accusations: Sam Bankman-Fried Prepares to Plead His Case Directly to Jury
 
Having already shared his side of the story with outlets like The New York Times and Good Morning America, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is gearing up to assert his innocence to a panel comprising 12 jurors and six alternate jurors.
 
Defense counsel Mark Cohen announced that SBF will take the witness stand, in a press statement conducted via teleconference on Wednesday. This development has been widely reported, with Matthew Russell Lee of Inner City Press providing insights. Russell Lee has confirmed that he will be broadcasting a live stream of SBF’s testimony through social media platform X.
 
SBF has sat through testimonies from past colleagues, including Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh. He has also heard from FTX’s former general counsel and the CEO of Blockfi, all of whom have testified against him.
 
 
Despite these challenges, the ex-FTX CEO maintains his innocence, pleading not guilty to all charges, even as he stares down a potential sentence of over 100 years in prison. His testimony is scheduled for Thursday, October 26, 2023, and Cohen has hinted that it will be a comprehensive examination likely to take all day.
 
SBF won’t be the only one speaking in his defense; Joseph Pimbley of PF2 Securities is also set to testify on his behalf. The latest development follows strategic moves by both the U.S. government and SBF’s defense team as they submitted their juror preferences and requests in anticipation of the trial’s outcome.
