        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin has clearly had a hard time keeping up its gains, as shown by recent price action. Dogecoin’s price has already dropped by 20% from its $0.223 price on the last day of March as bulls have failed to keep it above the support level at $0.2. 
 
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has reiterated his stance on the future outlook of the meme cryptocurrency. According to him, DOGE’s recent price action has largely mirrored the 2018-2021 pattern. Particularly, the crypto cemented a break out from a descending pattern and has now formed a bullish fractal that could push it into a massive parabolic bull run.
