Bitcoin Makes Recovery As Coinbase Premium Index Turns Green
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index has surged into the positive territory recently after having been negative during the crash.
 
 
The “Coinbase Premium Index” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the percentage difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FTX verdict is out. US District Judge Peter Castel approved a $12.7 billion deal that requires the failed exchange FTX and its sister trade company, Alameda Research, to pay their debts.
 
 
On August 7, 2024, a verdict was issued that concludes a protracted legal dispute with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which originated after FTX’s sudden decline in late 2022.
 
The deal represents a significant stride in addressing the financial issues stemming from one of the biggest corporate disasters in the history of crypto.
 
With $8.7 billion reserved especially for investors misled by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, the proposed settlement calls for the whole $12.7 billion to be distributed to repaying FTX creditors.

Is Taiwan Next To Adopt Bitcoin?
 
Samson Mow’s advocacy for Bitcoin comes from his extensive experience in pushing for its adoption at a national level, as seen through his previous involvement in El Salvador‘s Bitcoin initiatives.
