        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto market volumes hit historic lows in September, plunging to levels not seen in several years. This downturn has had a domino effect, causing a sharp drop in the prices of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization at the beginning of the week. 
 
According to a Blockworks report, average daily volumes on centralized exchanges tumbled to $8.4 billion in August, marking a 16% decrease from the prior month and a staggering 78% decline year over year. 
 
This steep decline in trading activity reflects a significant loss of interest in cryptocurrencies, even as they remain a hot topic in financial markets.

        <updated>2023-09-12T19:09:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the “Avalon Bitcoin & Crypto Day” conference in Singapore, the bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) manufacturer Canaan showcased its new Avalon-made 14 series mining rigs. One of the mining machines, the A1466I, boasts an energy efficiency of fewer than 20 joules per terahash (J/T), approximately 19.5 J/T, and has a production capacity of up to 170 terahash per second (TH/s).
 
Canaan’s Liquid-Cooled A1466I: A Game-Changer in Bitcoin Mining Efficiency
 
Canaan has officially unveiled its new Avalon series 14 miners after previously teasing the products last month. One of these miners features an efficiency rating below 20 J/T and offers an energy efficiency ratio of 19.5 J/T. This specific mining rig is the A1466I, which utilizes liquid cooling and produces up to 170 TH/s in terms of SHA256 hashrate output.
 
 
During the Canaan presentation at the event, the company highlighted the availability of two cooling options: submerged liquid-cooled and air-cooled models. The other Avalon 14 series miner, the A1466, is air-cooled and boasts a hashrate of 150 TH/s with an energy efficiency ratio of 21.5 J/T. The Vice President of Canaan, Davis Hui, delivered the presentation onstage, marking Canaan’s 10th anniversary.
 
 
It’s noteworthy that Avalon-brand miners crafted by Canaan were the first ASIC bitcoin miners to be publicly sold in January 2013. However, while Canaan is the pioneer in introducing a machine with an efficiency rating below 20 J/T, its competitor Bitmain plans to launch its Antminer S21 line at the 2023 World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) in Hong Kong from September 22 to 23. According to Bitmain, the S21 will also feature an efficiency rating of 1X J/T.
