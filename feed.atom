While it is trusted and custodial, Wallet of Satoshi has been invaluable in giving casual users a functional and reliable tool for small value payments made across the Lightning Network. This departure from serving the US will leave a massive hole in the Lightning toolbox for American Bitcoiners. 
Custodial tools are not the ideal type of tool, especially for anything beyond small amounts, but it is impossible to deny they have a place in this ecosystem. They are not for everyone, and certainly not in my opinion for anything even remotely approaching a significant sum of money, but they can be useful when the risks are wel…]]></summary>

This raise was accomplished under the leadership of venture capital firm Big Brain Holdings, alongside the valued participation from UTXO Management, Kelsier Ventures, BOOGLE Syndicate, and various strategic web3 angel investors.
"We are honoured to partner with such prestigious entities in the financial and technological sectors," Saturn's official X (Twitter) account, stated. "Their combined industry knowledge, expertise, and networks are indispensable to our mission. This investment does not merely represent financial backing; it embodies a shared belief in a Bitcoin-centric future and the role Saturn will play in shaping it."
The funding round is to support Saturn's mission to redefine possibilities within the realm of Bitcoin. These investments aim to propel the development of new infrastructure tailored to foster a seamless ecosystem for fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network.
“I see a future where Bitcoin can onboard millions of users to Bitcoin, bringing a fungible token experience that is familiar to that of an experience on Ethereum or Solana,” said Hex, Founder of Saturn.
For further information about Saturn and its journey ahead, interested parties can reach out to the company here.

New Push To Decentralize Bitcoin Mining
 
OCEAN, heralded as a major shift in mining seeks to disrupt the traditional mining pool model, which has been critiqued for fostering centralization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FutureBit, a renowned innovator in consumer-centric Bitcoin products, today announced the Apollo II, a revolutionary personal home mining device. This new launch marks a significant stride in FutureBit's journey to introduce efficient, potent, and user-friendly mining products for household use. The Apollo II is a fusion of the latest 5nm ASIC technology and a modern, intuitive design, establishing a new benchmark in the personal Bitcoin mining industry.
Accompanying the Apollo II is the newly enhanced Apollo OS 2.0, featuring an integrated personal mining pool within the device itself. This innovation allows individuals, regardless of their technical expertise, to easily engage in solo mining directly to their Bitcoin node, offering a realistic opportunity to mine a complete Bitcoin block. This feature is particularly significant as it aids in the expansion of network decentralization, which is currently dominated by centralized mining pools.
John Stefanopoulos, the founder of FutureBit, emphasized the company's mission, stating, “Our goal is to return Bitcoin to a state where individual users have power over the Bitcoin network and not centralized farms and pools. This can only be accomplished by hardware that combines powerful ASIC hardware and a full Bitcoin node and getting hardware like the Apollo II out to millions of Bitcoin users.”
The Apollo II symbolizes FutureBit's dedication to decentralizing Bitcoin mining and making it accessible to a wider audience while empowering individual users in the Bitcoin network.

Introduction
Until this election cycle, Bitcoin has flown under the radar when it comes to the national political stage. For the first time in its history, Bitcoin is becoming a prominent issue for presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle. While there’s been some mention of Bitcoin from the previous president as well as Bitcoin-related policies made by the current one, this election is shaping up to be Bitcoin’s time in the spotlight.
At this stage in the race, there are a multitude of presidential candidates, each with their own stance on Bitcoin’s place in the national conversation. We have taken the opportunity to reach out to these candidates to hea…]]></summary>

        <id>http://www.inoreader.com/article/3a9c6e74911a6f61</id>
        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ai-focused-cryptocurrency-sector-expands-by-2-billion-in-less-than-2-weeks/"/>
        <updated>2023-11-29T15:32:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent market data reveals a significant surge in the AI-focused cryptocurrency sector, with its value ballooning by nearly $2 billion in just under two weeks. A major contributor to this growth is the token bittensor (TAO), which soared 86.5% in the last fortnight.
 
AI Crypto Economy Rebounds Strongly
 
In the AI-oriented crypto landscape, the past month has been marked by impressive growth. The top six AI tokens have all experienced double-digit percentage increases. TAO leads the pack with a striking 207% rise in the last 30 days. Following closely, fetch (FET) has climbed 46.34%, and covalent (CQT) has risen 41.91% against the U.S. dollar during the same period.
 
 
In the past month, the graph (GRT) experienced a 35% increase, while singularitynet (AGIX) witnessed a 28% uptick in its value. As of 12 days ago, on November 17, 2023, the valuation of the AI-centric crypto economy stood at $3.32 billion. This was a recovery to previous levels, achieved over three months, adding approximately $720 million from its July end low of $2.6 billion.
 
In just the last 12 days, the sector has expanded by an impressive $1.97 billion. This growth is largely attributed to TAO’s rise, escalating from a market value of $329 million on October 29 to today’s $1.297 billion. Cortex (CTXC) also emerged as a significant player in the AI-focused arena, climbing from the 17th to the 11th position in terms of market capitalization.
 
 
CTXC’s market value soared from $37 million to a current $90.62 million, following a 194.12% surge this past month. However, not all AI-centric cryptocurrencies fared well over the same period. GOC, XMON, NEURONI, ARCONA, AMC, DX, XRT, and ALI all recorded double-digit declines during the 30-day timeframe.
