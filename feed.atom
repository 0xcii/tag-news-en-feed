        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robinhood has agreed to acquire leading Bitcoin and crypto exchange Bitstamp for $200 million in cash, marking a major expansion of its Bitcoin and crypto business. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025.

BREAKING: ROBINHOOD BUYS #BITCOIN AND CRYPTO EXCHANGE BITSTAMP FOR $200 MILLION. pic.twitter.com/Q9LfBDw3Di
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 6, 2024
  
  
  
Founded in 2011, Bitstamp is one of the world's oldest and most established crypto exchanges. It operates across Europe, Asia and the U.S., with over 50 licenses globally. The acquisition will bring Bitstamp's institutional and retail customers under Robinhood's umbrella.
Robinhood aims to leverage Bitstamp's reputation for resilience and trust to bolster its own Bitcoin and crypto offerings. Bitstamp underwent over a decade of market cycles and maintained high-security standards. 
The purchase comes as Robinhood faces scrutiny from the SEC over its crypto division. However, Bitcoin and crypto remain a key driver of growth, with transaction revenue from crypto trading jumping 40% last year. Acquiring an established platform like Bitstamp could significantly expand Robinhood's global reach.
Robinhood general manager Johann Kerbrat said the deal is a "major step in growing our crypto business" and will help Robinhood "expand our footprint outside of the U.S. and welcome institutional customers." Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev says, "We believe crypto will fundamentally reorganize the financial system."
Robinhood has already been offering Bitcoin and crypto trading services in the EU. But buying Bitstamp provides a ready-made base of customers and regulatory licensing across multiple jurisdictions.  As Bitcoin demand increases, the acquisition positions Robinhood to capture growing trading volumes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Renowned personal finance author Robert Kiyosaki has predicted Bitcoin will reach $350,000 by August 25, 2024. The Rich Dad, Poor Dad writer has long been a Bitcoin bull, touting Bitcoin as hard money alternatives.

NEW: Rich Dad, Poor Dad author predicts #Bitcoin will reach $350,000 by August 2024.
Are you prepared? 🙌 pic.twitter.com/6Isr7UZUVT
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 6, 2024
  
  
  
In a recent X post, Kiyosaki projected Bitcoin to hit $350,000 based on his lack of faith in U.S. leadership. He labelled President Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as "the 3 Stooges in real life" and said he was confident in their incompetence.
Kiyosaki advised buying more Bitcoin to protect against poor economic stewardship. He has frequently criticized the U.S. government's stimulus spending and money-printing policies under Biden.
While a long-term Bitcoin believer, Kiyosaki's $350,000 target within two months is an extremely bullish projection. For bitcoin to reach that price by August, it would need to surge over 380% from current levels near $71,000.
Still, the author sees potential for explosive Bitcoin growth ahead, calling his prediction "not a lie." Kiyosaki endorsed Ark Invest's $2.3 million long-term Bitcoin price forecast earlier this year.
The bold projection follows surging inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw their second-highest daily haul ever on Tuesday at over $880 million. 
Improving mainstream acceptance has buoyed Kiyosaki's outlook. With major financial centres like Australia, the U.K., and the U.S. embracing spot bitcoin ETFs, confidence is rising. 
While $350,000 by August appears overly optimistic, the author advocates Bitcoin's potential as a hedge against what he views as unsound government policies. Kiyosaki urges investors to continue accumulating positions in Bitcoin.]]></summary>
