In his speech, Trump positioned himself as a pro-cryptocurrency candidate, emphasizing his positive view of cryptocurrency companies and the potential for the US to become a leader in the field. He pledged to appoint Libertarians to his Cabinet and other senior administration posts if elected.

One of Mow’s primary concerns is the failure of many politicians to distinguish between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He emphasizes that Bitcoin, with its decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant nature, stands apart from many other digital currency projects that may have different characteristics and risk profiles.
