Schwartz explained that unlike Proof-of-Work systems like Bitcoin, the XRP Ledger relies on a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism called the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RCPΑ) for security.

Here’s how Schwartz describes it: “The only problem you can’t fix [with every node enforcing every rule] is the double spend problem […] the only way that you could sort of attack the XRP Ledger was to stop the global ordering from working and that would just cause the whole the whole network to halt.”
