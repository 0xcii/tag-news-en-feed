The transaction revenue from the third quarter came in at $288.6 million, a 12 percent decline quarter-over-quarter. Coinbase justified that the fall in transaction revenue was due to the declining overall crypto markets and volatility.

As a consequence, Bankman-Fried potentially confronts a maximum sentence of 110 years in prison.
 
The prosecution alleged that Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and overseer of both FTX and its affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research, engaged in the misallocation and misappropriation of billions of dollars from FTX customer deposits.
 
Additionally, he was accused of orchestrating deceptive practices to mislead investors and purportedly instructing fellow executives within his businesses to partake in similar misconduct.
