Though the SEC has generally been considered to have suffered by the judgment, Stark has expressed reservations about its stability and the likelihood of appeals and reversals.
 
He advised the community to exercise caution and refrain from premature jubilation in an article that provoked thinking on July 14.
 
Stark’s viewpoint is fundamental because of his knowledge and experience in securities law. Despite its initial euphoria, he argues that the Ripple decision should not be immediately praised as a massive triumph for the cryptocurrency industry.

In a blog post published on Monday, July 17, the exchange announced that deposits and withdrawals for Bitcoin (BTC) are now open on the Lightning Network.
 
This integration marks a significant milestone for the industry as it opens up new avenues for faster, more efficient, and scalable Bitcoin transactions. Back in May 2023, Binance hinted at an imminent integration. The exchange temporarily halted Bitcoin withdrawals due to an unprecedented surge in volume triggered by increased interest in Ordinals.
