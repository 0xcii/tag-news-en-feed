Speaking at the Barron’s Advisor 100 Summit in Palm Beach, Florida, Hougan shared insights on how some of the “most powerful people” in the financial industry are beginning to embrace digital assets like Bitcoin.
 
 
Personal Crypto Investments Leading The Way
 
During his keynote speech, Hougan engaged the audience by asking how many attendees owned Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in their portfolios. He noted that, while in previous years, only 10-20% of hands were raised, this year saw nearly 70% of attendees acknowledging personal crypto holdings.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has revealed intentions to compel cryptocurrency enterprises, including exchanges, to seek financial services licenses under the Corporations Act.
 
This decision comes amid growing worries about frauds and the need for an extensive monitoring of the fast changing digital asset sector.

As bulls strengthen and fundamental factors swing in favor of the world’s most valuable coin, prices remain below $65,000. Looking at the daily chart, this reaction level coincides with August highs. 
 
Technically, if buyers find the required momentum, breaking above this level, it could soar to as high as $70,000, a psychological level, and even break $72,000. If this happens, it will mark the first time since June that bulls have overcome the resistance at their reaction level.
