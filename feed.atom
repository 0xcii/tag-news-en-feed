Nasdaq’s Crypto Plans On Ice
 
The announcement comes as a surprise as the company previously announced plans to offer custody services for Bitcoin and Ether for institutional investors. The exchange operator had planned to launch the service by the end of the second quarter but now says it will no longer pursue a license related to the business.
 
 
Nasdaq’s decision to halt its digital-asset custodian business is a reflection of the rapidly evolving regulatory environment surrounding crypto. The company cited the changing business and regulatory environment as the reason …]]></summary>

Peter Schiff’s Son, Spencer, Appears to Have Made Complete Turnaround
 
Spencer Schiff, son of renowned economist and gold advocate Peter Schiff, used to engage in debates about bitcoin’s value with his father in 2021.

According to a report by Bloomberg, France’s stock market regulator, Autorité des Marches Financiers (AMF), approved the first DASP license for SG Forge on Tuesday, July 18, expanding the reach of the Societe Generale Bank in the digital asset space. 
 
Ordinarily, this may sound puzzling as there are a good number of digital assets service providers currently operating in France, such as Binance, Bistamp, Voyager, etc. However, the AMF notes that these businesses are only registered with its agency and do not possess a DASP license.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana ended a three-day losing streak on Wednesday, as the token moved back above the $26.00 mark. The decline came following Friday’s move above $32.00, which took the price to an eight-month high. XRP has also rebounded today, and looks to be heading for its recent high over $0.9400.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was one of Wednesday’s notable movers, as the token ended a three-day losing streak.
 
Following a low of $25.12 on Tuesday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $26.57 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move is the first time solana has trended higher since consolidating a recent eight-month high.
 
 
From the chart, today’s rebound seems to have occurred as a result of the relative strength index (RSI) bouncing from a floor at 66.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is at 69.40, with an upcoming resistance point of 71.00 a possible destination for bulls.
 
Should this ceiling be broken, there is a good chance that solana could head back towards $30.00.
 
 
XRP
 
Sentiment remained largely bullish in XRP, formerly ripple, as traders once again attempted to push prices above $0.8200.
 
XRP/USD jumped to a peak of $0.8155 earlier in today’s session, before slipping to a current point at $0.7999.
 
Since climbing to $0.9479 last week, volatility in the token has skyrocketed, with both new buyers, and profit takers, battling for positions.
 
 
Market uncertainty has marginally faded, as a result of the RSI breaking out of a ceiling at 73.00. It is now tracking at 75.07.
 
Despite the next visible point of resistance being at 89.00, price is already overbought, which could lead to a prolonged sell-off.
 
As of writing, XRP remains largely unchanged at the $0.8000 mark.
