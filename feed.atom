        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a startling revelation during Coinbase’s Q2 earnings call, CEO Brian Armstrong revealed that Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has liquidated its entire holdings of the stablecoin USDC. This unexpected disclosure comes as a surprise, prompting a flurry of speculation and analysis about Binance’s motivations and the potential implications for the stablecoin market.
 
“USDC market cap is up after Binance pulled out,” Armstrong reportedly stuttered during Coinbase’s earnings call. “The unexpected answer seemed to imply that crypto exchange Binance was a holder of Circle and that USDC is safer now that Binance no longer holds the stablecoin,” the media outlet Protos writes in an exclusive report.

Coinbase Fights Back Against SEC’s Crypto Exchange Lawsuit
 
In a court filing submitted on Friday, Coinbase contends the SEC’s claims rely on an overbroad reading of the term “investment contract” that departs from decades of precedent and statutory text. The crypto-centric company says the SEC fails to allege the transactions facilitated on its exchange include any contractual rights entitling buyers to future profits or income from issuers, an essential element of an investment contract.

Ethereum Open Interest & Bollinger Bands May Have Correlation
 
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the pattern of the ETH Open Interest and Bollinger Bands may be used to analyze the market’s movements. The first of these metrics, the “Open Interest,” refers to a measure of the total amount of Ethereum futures contracts that are open on all derivative exchanges.
 
When the value of this indicator is high, it means that the investors currently have a large number of positions in the market currently. Generally, during such conditions, the total leverage in the market is also high, which can lead to the price displaying volatility.

An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment that tracks a specific asset or commodity, in this case, bitcoin. ETFs can be bought and sold on stock exchanges and brokerage accounts, with the custody of the underlying asset being held by the manager of the ETF. This allows for investors to get price exposure to bitcoin without having to worry about self-custody or figuring out how to use a bitcoin exchange. This would potentially give traditional investors peace of mind since they could purchase shares of a spot bitcoin ETF directly through their familiar brokerage accounts.
There are many types of Bitcoin ETFs available. The futures ETFs have had most success in being approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) thus far, but these track futures contracts …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference is thrilled to welcome renowned whistleblower and cybersecurity expert, Edward Snowden, to its landmark event, where he will share his insights on the intersection of digital currency, privacy, and the future of financial freedom during a 45 minute long online talk with a Q&A session. 
The event will take place in Westergas, Amsterdam on October 12-13, 2023 and will bring together industry leaders, enthusiasts, and experts to discuss the future of bitcoin, decentralization and freedom.




“In 2013, Ed Snowden alerted the American people to the fact that the US Government was knowingly conducting warrantless surveillance of its own citizens; a violation of basic rights. It was a watershed moment both for government overreach, as well as for the ability of individual freedom fighters and cypherpunks to push back. As Snowden announced to the world at Bitcoin 2019, Bitcoin was a key tool in his efforts to expose the ongoing surveillance,” said Brandon Green, Head of Events for BTC Inc. “10 years after his initial action, Snowden will talk to our community at Bitcoin Amsterdam about the ongoing fight to protect privacy for individuals, not just in the US, but around the world, and especially right here in Europe. And he will discuss the importance of Bitcoin in that fight,” continued Green.
As a prominent advocate for cybersecurity and freedom, Edward Snowden has long expressed his support for Bitcoin, stating "Bitcoin is free money... When I think about liberty, that’s what this is all about. It’s freedom from permission." 
He views it as an essential tool for preserving financial privacy and protecting individuals from surveillance and censorship. Snowden's endorsement of Bitcoin aligns with its core principles of decentralization, transparency, and financial sovereignty, making his appearance at the Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference highly anticipated.]]></summary>

The SEC initiated an urgent legal intervention against Digital Licensing Inc., operating under the name “DEBT Box,” as well as its four principals and 13 other defendants. The enforcement action encompassed the firm’s four principals: Jason Anderson, Jacob Anderson (his brother), Schad Brannon, and Roydon Nelson.
 
This response follows the identification of an alleged fraudulent scheme, involving the sale of unregistered crypto asset securities referred to as “node licenses” to numerous US investors, accumulating an approximate total of $50 million.

The Bureau of Economic Security (BEB) of Ukraine recently notified that these unrelated crypto exchanges have led to the loss of at least 3 billion hryvnia in tax revenue, roughly $80 million, spanning from 2013 to 2023. 
 
An in-depth examination conducted by the BEB highlighted that trades involving significant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Tether (USDT) amassed a collective trading volume exceeding $55 billion on Ukrainian-based exchanges between 2013 and 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was one of Friday’s biggest movers, as markets reacted to the news that Binance had approved the meme coin as a collateralized asset. The cryptocurrency exchange confirmed that it was adding 22 new loanable and collateral assets to its Flexible and VIP Loan services. Solana was another notable gainer on Friday.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) rose by over 5% on Friday, on the news that  was adding the asset to its Flexible and VIP Loan services.
 
SHIB/USD hit an intraday peak of $0.000008677 on the news, a day after trading at a low of $0.000008226.
 
The move resulted in the meme coin hitting its highest point since Monday, when it peaked at $0.00000872.
 
 
One of the catalysts for the surge also seemed to be a breakout of the 60.00 level on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time time of writing, the index is tracking at 62.20, which is marginally below a higher ceiling of 63.00
 
Earlier gains have already eased, with traders likely securing profits in anticipation of a collision with this zone.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Additionally, solana (SOL) returned to the green during today’s session, snapping a two-day losing streak in the process.
 
After falling to a bottom of $22.52 on Thursday, SOL/USD climbed to a high of $23.13 earlier in today’s session.
 
Despite today’s rebound in price, solana is still trading almost 7% lower than at the same point last week.
 
 
The rally began after the RSI bounced from a support level at the 45.00 mark, rising to a current reading of 49.04.
 
Bulls are likely targeting a move back above the $25.00 level, however they will first need to move beyond an upcoming wall of 50.00 on the indicator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market is often described as the “Wild West” of finance – a vast, decentralized landscape filled with opportunity and risk in equal measure. For traders seeking to harness crypto’s explosive growth while managing its volatility, leveraged trading has emerged as a double-edged sword. Used properly, margin trading allows traders to amplify profits. However, without prudent risk management, it can also dramatically magnify losses. 
 
PrimeXBT, a leading multi-asset margin trading platform, has introduced an adjustable leverage system that provides traders with more control over risk versus reward. But before delving into PrimeXBT’s innovations, it’s important to understand exactly how margin trading works and the inherent benefits and dangers it presents.
