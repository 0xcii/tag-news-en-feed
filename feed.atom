Once enacted, the law will require VASPs seeking a license

The law is designed to ensure that VASPs operate responsibly and to prevent the

JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japanese public company Metaplanet buys another ¥500 million worth of #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/utiXEwsymM
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 20, 2024
  
  
  
Metaplanet bought 57.273 bitcoins at an average price of ¥8.73 million per bitcoin. This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 360.368 bitcoins acquired for ¥3.45 billion ($25.6 million).
Metaplanet first announced plans to raise ¥10.08 billion through a public offering to fund Bitcoin purchases on August 6. A week later, it secured a ¥1 billion loan to buy Bitcoin, which it has now used to purchase over 100 Bitcoin so far.
The Japanese firm is aggressively expanding its Bitcoin reserves by borrowing capital at low interest rates. This mimics the "buy Bitcoin strategy" of MicroStrategy, which since 2020 has sold debt and equity to amass over 226,500 Bitcoin treasury.
Other public Bitcoin buyers raising capital recently include Marathon Digital Holdings, which sold $300 million of convertible notes to buy Bitcoin. Semler Scientific also issued equity and debt partly to purchase Bitcoin.
Metaplanet's series of loans and stock offerings to fund Bitcoin buys illustrates how public companies are utilizing markets to stack sats. With Bitcoin gaining mainstream adoption, firms are treating it as a treasury reserve asset.

While most everyone believes he would be a very strong nominee for the position, most Republicans are really expressing a lot of reservation about his record at the agency, which leaves some alarming concerns about his capacity to lead an important department like the Treasury Department.
 
 
Gensler has had no shortage of critics since being confirmed to the helm of the SEC. One of his most vocal critics is Republican Tom Emmer, a representative of Minnesota. He questions whether Gensler has done anything positive through the “lawsuit-heavy approach.”
