        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, are facing yet another class action lawsuit, this time brought by three cryptocurrency investors who allege that the exchange failed to prevent money laundering. The lawsuit was filed last Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, Seattle.
Laundering of Stolen Crypto
The three primary plaintiffs claim that their cryptocurrencies were stolen and subsequently deposited by the thieves on Binance to "remove the connection between the ledger and their digital assets," thereby making the stolen cryptocurrencies untraceable.
The lawsuit alleges that Binance was complicit in the money laundering process, which constitutes a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin and Ethereum prices faded after marching to March 2024 peaks. After Bitcoin soared to fresh all-time highs of around $73,800, it only took nearly five months for prices to flash crash sharply, dumping below $50,000 in early August. 
 
Amid this sell-off, Ethereum wasn’t also spared. By August 5, the coin fell to as low as $2,100. Even though prices bounced on the days that followed these losses, the uptrend momentum has been shaky, and there are doubts that buyers will sustain the leg up.

Republican Party Seizes Crypto Mantle
 
As Bitcoinist reported on Monday, the Democratic Party’s 2024 platform, unveiled at the Democratic National Convention this week, notably omitted any mention of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, or blockchain. 
 
This absence of support has been met with dismay from the crypto community, which had hoped for greater acknowledgment and endorsement from the party now led by Vice President Kamala Harris.
