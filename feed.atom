        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Turkish court has sentenced Faruk Fatih Özer, the founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange Thodex, to an effective seven months and 15 days in prison. During the trial, Özer denied being an executive of the crypto exchange when the platform allegedly failed to furnish the Tax Inspection Board with the documents requested. 
 
Appointment of Trustee Reportedly Made Submission of Requested Documents Impossible
 
A court in Turkey has sentenced Faruk Fatih Özer, the founder of the defunct cryptocurrency exchange Thodex, to just over seven months in prison for failing to furnish the Tax Inspection Board with the documents it requested. However, according to a report in the Hurriyet Daily News, the Anatolian 17th Criminal Court of First Instance has since agreed to delay announcing the verdict as well as the implementation of the sentence.
 
As explained in the report, Özer, who was arrested in Albania in Aug. 2022, claimed that he was not a company executive when the alleged crime was committed. He also argued that the appointment of a trustee had made it impossible for him to submit the requested documents. Özer’s pleas nevertheless failed to sway prosecutors who were reportedly seeking a five-year jail sentence.
 

 
According to the report, the court initially ruled that the founder of Thodex should spend one year and six months behind bars. However, after considering the founder’s reported behavior before and during the trial, the Turkish court eventually ruled that Özer should only be in jail for seven months and 15 days.
 
Meanwhile, in addition to failing to submit tax documents, Özer is also accused of defrauding investors via his crypto platform. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, the Thodex founder was arrested in Albania several months after he fled from Turkey with $2 billion which belonged to investors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a research report, NYDIG’s Global Head of Research, Greg Cipolaro, delved into the highly anticipated spot Bitcoin ETF and its potential impact on the BTC price. Cipolaro examines the opportunity it presents, its implications for the investment community, and the potential demand it could unleash. The analysis also sheds light on the existing landscape of BTC funds, the comparisons to gold, and the potential scenarios that could unfold if a spot Bitcoin ETF were to materialize.
 
Before examining the potential impact of a spot ETF, it is crucial to grasp the current state of Bitcoin investments. While the US has not yet witnessed a spot ETF, existing structures, including trusts like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), futures-based ETFs, spot-based ETFs outside the US, and private fund…]]></summary>

According to France’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers, the license allows Forge to offer services which include crypto custody, trading, and sales.
 
License Said to Enable Forge to Meet Institutional Demand for Digital Assets
 
Forge, the crypto division of France’s banking giant Societe Generale, recently received what is being described as the first crypto services license issued under the country’s crypto assets laws, a report has said. French market regulator Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) stated on its website that the license allows Forge to offer services which include crypto custody, trading, and sales.
 
According to a Reuters report, the license given to Forge does not subject the Societe Generale’s subsidiary to the same onerous rules faced by other crypto entities, particularly in the areas of corporate governance, information technology, and compliance.
 

 
Jean-Marc Stenger, the CEO of Forge, said the license enables his company to meet demand from institutional clients for digital assets.
 
“This step will allow us to continue supporting our institutional clients wishing to benefit from services on digital assets that meet the highest standards of compliance and banking security,” Stenger said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that the U.S. economy will face “more than a recession” if he is not elected president. Trump also made several other promises, including getting Russia’s President Vladimir Putin to make a deal with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “very quickly.”
 
Donald Trump’s Warnings
 
Former U.S. President Donald Trump made several promises and predictions during an interview with Fox News Sunday. He was asked about his plan to get the U.S. economy growing again and whether he thinks the U.S. is going into a recession. “If people think Trump is going to be elected, you’ll never have a recession … because people will start investing,” the former president claimed, adding:
 

If people think I’m not, you’ll have more than a recession. You’re going to have a depression.
 
“But, what I would do is very simple. I’ve got to get interest rates down. We have to get rid of inflation because inflation is a country killer,” he stressed, noting that the Biden administration is “putting the interest rates at a point nobody can borrow.”
 
 
Trump also made a number of other promises. For example, he said: “We’ll close up the border. We’ll become energy independent, then we’re going to be energy dominant. We’ll be taking care of Europe. Energy prices are going to come down. I will get [Russian President] Putin to make a deal with [Ukrainian President] Zelenskyy very quickly. We’re going to have a great world again.” Moreover, Trump opined: “If we don’t win in ’24, this country is finished. I really believe that.”
 
In April, the former president warned that the U.S. dollar is crashing and soon will “no longer be the world standard.” In addition, he cautioned that “we are very close” to a third world war.
