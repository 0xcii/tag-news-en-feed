This encouraging trend marks the second consecutive year of decreasing scam revenue, reflecting positive developments in the cryptocurrency landscape. 
 
However, in the face of this decline, Chainalysis also highlighted a concerning rise in ransomware revenues, which have reached $449 million year-to-date and could potentially surge to a staggering $939 million by year’s end. 
 
These findings shed light on the evolving nature of crypto-related crimes and emphasize the importance of staying vigilant in the face of emerging threats.

During a recent webinar, Gensler was pressed about Coinbase’s involvement in the ETF filings. While he refrained from commenting specifically on the filings, his remarks on crypto exchanges and their “conflicting services” and “limited risk monitoring” were far from encouraging. Gensler stated, “What that means is they could be trading directly against you and market making against you, which you would not see, or hope to see on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ.”
