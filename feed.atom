        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem had an event-filled week with several developments surrounding the meme coin. These developments again highlighted the mixed sentiment towards Shiba Inu (SHIB), with the crypto token running the risk of declining further from its current price level. 
 
Shibarium Sees Spike In Total Value Locked
 
Data from DeFiLlama shows that the total value locked (TVL) on the layer-2 network Shibarium spiked this week, peaking at $2.45 million on May 30. This shows a growing confidence among investors in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It also represents a positive development given that Shibarium’s TVL had declined significantly after surging to a record-high of $3.9 million in March.
