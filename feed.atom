        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prominent attorney advocating for XRP investors, John Deaton, has shared his views on the ongoing case between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Deaton took to X (formerly Twitter), predicting a prolonged timeline before a final judgment is reached and also pointed to the slim chances of a settlement between the two parties.
 
“I do not believe there has been a single serious conversation regarding settlement between Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, Chris Larsen and the SEC. The SEC is pissed and embarrassed and wants $770M worth of flesh,” Deaton stated. He elaborated further, emphasizing the thoroughness required for the penalty phase. “What people need to understand is that the penalty phase is like a second case requiring more depositions, interrogatories, requests …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On October 13, 2023, California enacted the Digital Financial Assets law. This law is California’s first comprehensive framework for regulation of digital asset markets, and some of its provisions may sound familiar to those versed in the state’s money transmitter licensing requirements. Under this new law, on and after July 2025, crypto companies and everyone else will need, in addition to other criteria, a license to operate or hold themselves out as being able to operate digital financial asset business activity, with or on behalf of California residents.

Reddit User Questions The Influence Of BlackRock On Bitcoin ETF Application
 
The user expressed concern that while the agency has been reviewing several Bitcoin ETFs, none have been approved yet.

The sudden removal of the ETF from the DTCC’s listings on Tuesday, coupled with the temporary unavailability of the DTCC website, led to a significant drop in Bitcoin’s price. 
 
However, after being relisted, Bitcoin has resumed its bullish trajectory, trading at $34,600 to reclaim the $35,000 level.

Disturbingly, this method made up roughly 65.1% of all Q3 hacks, Hacken’s research showed.
