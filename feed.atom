        <updated>2023-12-05T17:32:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the recent surge in the cryptocurrency market, the BRC20 token ORDI has experienced substantial growth. This week, it reached a new milestone with its market capitalization surpassing the $1 billion threshold. The token’s value has soared by 676% in the past month and by 189% in just the last week alone.
 
ORDI Token’s Meteoric Rise
 
During this period of widespread gains in the crypto sector, ORDI, a BRC20 token and the first of its kind built on the Bitcoin network, has achieved a market valuation of $1 billion. As of the latest update, ORDI’s trading price stands at $59 to $61 per unit, marking a significant 189% increase in value against the U.S. dollar. The coin’s trading range for the day has fluctuated between $39.94 and $63, bringing its current market value to $1.22 billion.
 

 
With a current market valuation of $1.22 billion, ORDI now ranks 57th among the more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies in existence. In addition to its 676% rise over the past month, ORDI has skyrocketed by 1,851% from its all-time low of $2.86 per coin, recorded on September 11, 2023. Over the last 24 hours, ORDI has surged by 45% in value against the dollar, with a global trading volume reaching $945 million.
 
 
On December 5, 2023, ORDI stands out with the tenth-highest trading volume in the cryptocurrency market. The token has also been active in derivatives markets, especially in the last 24 hours. This surge in the BRC20 token’s price has resulted in a notable $12.70 million in short positions being liquidated. Notably, the Turkish lira has played a significant role in the trading volumes of ORDI, followed by tether (USDT). Other leading trading pairs with ORDI include BTC, TUSD, FDUSD, and USD.
