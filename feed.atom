        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto regulations deepen as regulators continue to announce actions against the crypto industry. Today, the NBA Hall of Fame player Paul Pierce settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over charges of unlawful touting digital asset EthereumMax, which the regulator considers a ‘crypto security.’
 
This comes after the SEC continues to crack down on the crypto industry. Pierce was charged with the same offense as other celebrities who had something to do with promoting the cash grab scheme supported by the EthereumMax project.  
 
The Offense, The Judgement, And The EthereumMax Lesson 
 
In 2021, NBA legend Pierce promoted EthereumMax tokens. According to the SEC, this is considered an offense as Pierece failed to disclose that he was promoting the token for a profit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The persistent scarcity of foreign exchange may force the Nigerian central bank to delay repaying the $10.4 billion owed to local banks, analysts at Moody’s Investors Service have concluded. The central bank’s failure to pay its debts on time will likely force the affected financial institutions to similarly delay paying back their own forex-denominated debts.
 
Nigeria’s Declining Oil Revenues
 
Nigeria’s perennial shortage of foreign exchange may likely result in the country’s central bank failing to repay domestic lenders on time, the rating agency Moody’s Investors Service has said. As reported by Bloomberg, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) owes the West African nation’s so-called rated commercial lenders about $10.4 billion which the bank received in the form of swaps and forwards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polygon has extended recent gains, with prices climbing to a fresh ten-month high during Friday’s session. The token has now risen for a fourth consecutive session, and is up 13% from the same time last week. Polkadot also rallied on Friday, colliding with a key resistance level in the process. 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) rose for a fourth consecutive session on Friday, pushing prices to a fresh ten-month high.
 
Following a low of $1.36 on Thursday, MATIC/USD rallied to an intraday high of $1.48 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move pushed polygon to its strongest point since April 22, when prices were at a peak of $1.50.
 
Overall, this latest rally comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) raced past a higher ceiling at 70.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 73.23, which is its highest reading since late January.
 
Should momentum continue in this direction, there is a good chance that MATIC could move back above $1.50.
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) also surged in today’s session, as prices ran into a key resistance level earlier in the day.
 
DOT/USD hit a peak of $6.80 on Friday, which comes less than 24 hours after it traded at a floor of $6.31.
 
This resulted in polkadot breaking out of a long-term resistance point at the $6.75 mark, four days after trading at support of $6.15.
 
A major contributor to the move was the fact that the RSI moved beyond a ceiling at 58.00, and it is currently tracking at 59.02.
 
DOT bulls likely have a target of $7.00 in the coming days, with an upcoming resistance of 62.00 on the index a possible banana skin.
 
As of writing, polkadot is up almost 9% from the same point last week.
