        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock, the worlds largest asset manager, is reportedly on the brink of submitting an application for a Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund), as disclosed by a reliable source familiar with the matter. 
In their pursuit of a Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock has chosen Coinbase Custody as their trusted custodial solution. Moreover, the asset manager will rely on Coinbase's spot market data to ensure accurate and reliable pricing for the ETF. Coinbase and BlackRock have so far refrained from providing any official comments on the matter.
While the specifics of the upcoming ETF remain undisclosed, it is yet to be determined whether it will be based on spot or futures contracts. BlackRock, however, refrained from immediate comment, leaving investors eagerly awaiting further details.
It is worth noting that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulatory authority responsible for overseeing ETFs in the United States, has thus far rejected every application for a spot bitcoin ETF. Nevertheless, the commission has granted approval for several bitcoin futures ETFs, which have been successfully introduced for trading.
BlackRock's imminent filing for a Bitcoin ETF signals a turning point in the industry, as a prominent player in the traditional financial space acknowledges the potential of Bitcoin. If approved, the Bitcoin ETF would open doors to a new wave of adoption and provide investors with an unprecedented opportunity to participate in the Bitcoin market through a regulated and accessible investment vehicle.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An Israeli crypto entrepreneur was reportedly robbed of his digital assets at  
gunpoint in his Tel Aviv home two weeks ago, Israeli financial site Globes  
reported on Wednesday. The entrepreneur, whose identity has not been revealed, told police that robbers broke into his home, beat  
him mercilessly, and forced him to transfer all of his crypto holding to their  
wallets.

However,  
the outlet said the transactions were frozen by the wallet provider after they  
became suspicious of transfers and conversions done with the wallet. As a  
result, neither the robbers nor the entrepreneur has access to the  
cryptocurrencies stored in the wallet. 
According  
to Globes, the entrepreneur has now left Israel and remains nearly  
penniless.

Additionally, the regulation of tokens will fall under the purview of Brazil’s securities regulator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin fell below the $25,000 level for the first time since March, as the Federal Reserve opted to keep rates unchanged. However, to the surprise of many, the Fed also forecasted two further hikes in this current cycle. Ethereum reacted negatively to the news, dropping below $1,700.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin plunged to a multi-month low on Thursday, as markets continued to react to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision not to increase interest rates.
 
Chair Powell did forecast two further hikes, with core inflation still higher than the bank would like.
 
He stated: “I think if you look at the core PCE inflation overall, look at it over the last six months, you’re just not seeing a lot of progress.”
 
 
 
 
 

BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $24,820.20 on the news, which comes following a high of $26,040.66 on Wednesday.
 
 
 
As a result of the drop, bitcoin slipped to its weakest point since March 16, when price was at a bottom of $24,200.
 
Today’s decline came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell below a support point at 36.00. It is now tracking at 34.55.
 

 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) also tanked, with price falling below $1,700 for the first time in three months.
 
Following a high of $1,749.16 on Wednesday, ETH/USD hit a bottom at $1,624.14 earlier in the day.
 
This is the lowest level that ethereum has fallen to since March 15, which is the last time price traded at a floor of $1,620.
 
 
 
 
 

Thursday’s decline comes as price strength moved into oversold territory, with the RSI now at a reading below 30.00
 
The index now sits at 29.17, which is the weakest point it has reached since November last year, at which time ETH was trading near $1,000.
