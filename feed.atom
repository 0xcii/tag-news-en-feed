To provide some background, the Ordinals Protocol allows for the systematic identification of satoshis, which are the smallest units of Bitcoin. This protocol enables each satoshi to possess a unique identity, paving the way for the creation of Bitcoin-native digital artifacts known as nonfungible tokens (NFTs), where people can inscribe satoshis with customized content.
 
 
Within this context, a fascinating narrative has emerged, revealing the existence of a highly secretive group of individuals who specializes in identifying, tracking, and trading rare and valuable historical satoshis.…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ethereum-technical-analysis-btc-falls-below-26000-as-sec-sues-binance/"/>
        <updated>2023-06-06T12:51:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin plunged to its lowest point in over two months, as markets continue to react to the SEC versus Binance lawsuit. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing the crypto exchange for violation of U.S securities laws. Ethereum was also in the red, dropping below $1,800 in the process.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) sank to a multi-month low on Tuesday, as markets reacted to the news that  has been sued by the SEC.
 
BTC/USD dropped to a bottom at $25,445.17 earlier in today’s session, a day after trading at a high of $26,810.22.
 
This decline pushed bitcoin to its weakest point since March 17, when it was at a low of $24,946.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the drop in price coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) falling below a floor at 38.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 36.12, its weakest point since mid-March.
 
Despite a recent upwards crossover of moving averages (MA), the 10-day trendline has now firmly shifted direction.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) was also a victim of the recent storm surrounding the market, with prices dropping below $1,800.
 
Following a high at $1,870.82 to start the week, ETH/USD slipped to an intraday low of $1,780.21 earlier today.
 
In comparison to BTC, the decline in ETH was relatively muted, with prices hitting a ten-day low.
 
 
Overall, ethereum is now down by 6% in the last seven days, while bitcoin has lost over 8% of its value within that same period.
 
On the other hand, ethereum’s RSI reading currently sits close to a support point at 42.00.
 
As a result, bulls have moved to buy the earlier dip, with ETH now trading at $1,814.38.

The financial industry as a whole is continually shifting toward the digital space, with the global digital payments market generating almost $100 billion in revenue last year, with projections to reach $303 billion by 2030.
