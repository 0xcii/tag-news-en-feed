Now that the trial has concluded, a UK Judge granted a Worldwide Freezing Order (WFO) of $7.6 million in Wright’s assets. The decision was issued due to the high avoidance risk of the case’s payment costs.
 
 
Bitcoin’s Creator Could Be Anyone, It’s Just Not Wright
 
Craig Wright’s claims started in 2016 when he began to assert that he was behind the pseudonym identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. For years, these claims remained unproven and highly contested by the crypto community.
 
Wright faced several legal battles over his attempts to prove authorship of Bitcoin and to copyright BTC’s whitepape…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Sharks Have Purchased More Than 268,000 BTC In The Last Month
 
As analyst James Van Straten explains in a new post on X, Bitcoin entities holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have made some large net buying moves in the past month.
 
 
An “entity” here refers to a collection of addresses owned by the same investor as determined through analysis by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode.
 
The entities holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC are popularly known as “sharks.” At the current exchange rate of the asset, this range converts to about $6.93 million to $69.3 million.

Crypto Open Interest Has Been At Extreme Levels Recently
 
As CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn pointed out in a post on X, the total crypto open interest has recently been sitting around a whopping $51.3 billion.
 
The “open interest” here refers to the total amount of derivative positions related to all digital assets currently open on the various exchanges in the sector.
 
 
When the value of this metric rises, it means that the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market right now. Generally, the total leverage in the sector goes up when such a trend takes form, so the assets could become more likely to show…]]></summary>

The new device, an improvement upon its most efficient mining rig, the S21, is notably more efficient—and powerful—than the previous iteration of the device.
Irene Gao, VP of Mining at Bitmain, highlighted in her announcement how the Antminer S21 Pro has a hash rate of 234 TH/s and an energy efficiency ratio of 15.0 J/TH. In contrast, the Antminer S21 has a hash rate of 200 TH/s and a power consumption efficiency ratio of 17.5 J/TH.
Gao also highlighted how durable the S21 Pro is.
"It has the ability to deal with more challenging environments," she said, before sharing that the device can withstand temperatures of up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit).
The after coupon U.S. dollar to terahash rate for the device is $18.9/TH and Bitmain will begin shipping the device in Q3 2024.
This announcement comes just seven months after Bitmain launched the S21.
The S21 was quickly adopted by Bitcoin miners, as it has already sold out via the company's website.

"We truly believe this new product will be helpful for you to make your long-term plans for your mining expansion, especially before the new cycle," added Gao.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are trending higher than they were a year ago, but they are still a long way from their 2021 all-time high prices. While they both feature prominently in the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, they are still far below the market cap of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. So, if both DOGE and SHIB attained the market cap of Ethereum, what price would they be trading at?
 
Dogecoin With The Market Cap Of Ethereum
 
The Dogecoin market cap is currently sitting $30.7 billon while the price is at $0.214. This makes it the largest meme coin in the space in terms of market cap and puts it ahead of the likes of Shiba Inu. However, if the DOGE market cap were to reach the market cap of Ethereum, the price would trade much higher than it is now.
