Kraken Blacklists South Africans
 
According to a report by local media outlet Moneyweb, crypto exchange Kraken has stopped accepting deposits from its users in South Africa. This decision was made because Kraken’s banking partner placed the country on its anti-money laundering blacklist. 
 
Something similar happened earlier this year when USDC’s issuer, Circle, halted fiat payments from users in the country. It is believed Circle had made that decision in anticipation of greater financial sanctions on the country.

“@BoringSleuth” tweeted, “Who do I believe Ryoshi, the anonymous Founder of $SHIB is? I believe it is a combo of 2 people: Ryo Suzuki & Tsuyoshi Maruyama – Both Advisors to B2C2 Group.” The researcher further pointed out a curious coincidence: “Ryo Suzuki resigned as an advisor from B2C2 Group on 4/27/21, the exact same day Tsuyoshi Maruyama was appointed as an advisor for B2C2 Group.”
