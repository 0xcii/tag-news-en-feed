The article’s authors claim that bitcoin mining is harmful to the environment, while the editorial also alleges that one of the authors went to great lengths to investigate the story. However, bitcoin proponents disagree with the article’s premise and maintain that the Times reporter did not use current data. They also argue that the story was one-sided, with practically zero opposing viewpoints.

Bitcoin Holders Choosing To Hold Their Coins
 
A new report from Santiment has revealed that there are now more Bitcoin long-term holders compared to a year ago. More investors are just now content to hold on to their coins instead of selling at every move and this trend has seen a steady increase since the year began.
