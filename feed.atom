The final one emerged at the year’s end, attributed to crypto advocate Arthur Hayes, who warned that if exchange-traded funds (ETFs) achieve excessive success, “they will completely destroy bitcoin.”
 
Bitcoin Obituaries Dwindle in 2023
 
2023 has passed, and as recorded by the Bitcoin Obituaries list on 99bitcoins.com, a total of eight proclamations of bitcoin’s end were noted.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Profit/Loss Margin Spiked Before Crash
 
Not even a couple of days after Bitcoin registered its sharp rally above the $45,000 mark, the coin has already crashed and has retraced the gains made during the move.
 
There has been a lot of speculation in the market regarding why the cryptocurrency has witnessed this sudden plunge. Some believe the reason to be the rumor that the US SEC is going to reject all BTC ETFs.
 
 
The head of research at analytics firm CryptoQuant, Julio Moreno, though, has hinted at a different possibility. “People will look at everything for an explanation instead of just looking at the On-chain data,” …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many commentators compare Bitcoin with gold, the idea being that its finite supply makes it an attractive long-term store of value. There have been historical examples of broad adoption of gold currencies, such as the British Empire’s sovereign and half-sovereign. However, adoption of the sovereigns was often promoted and directed by the British imperial government, much to the dismay of local administrators who often suffered currency shortages. Bitcoin has no nation state to promote its adoption, so the comparison between it and gold sovereigns is a weak one. One of the world’s most heavily used silver currencies, the Spanish silver dollar, may offer a better comparison.

The popular Dogecoin enthusiast recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to outline an extensive list of why Dogecoin, a meme-based cryptocurrency would succeed without joining the ETF hype. 
 
 
According to the crypto expert, Dogecoin’s inherent status as a meme coin would significantly deter it from being completely acknowledged by renowned financial institutions. As a result, the possibility of the cryptocurrency becoming an ETF is unlikely.

In a surprising move that startled the cryptocurrency market, Circle’s USDC dollar-pegged stablecoin momentarily depegged from its $1 value, falling as low as $0.76 on the Binance exchange platform. This incident occurred during a market-wide sell-off, which was spurred by skepticism over the potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF this month.

The SEC’s argument hinges on the Terra case’s interpretation of the “investment contract” definition within the context of cryptocurrency offerings.
