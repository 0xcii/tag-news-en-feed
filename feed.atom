        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto security firm and hardware wallet manufacturer, Ledger, announced its integration of Paypal payments for U.S. customers. This will allow Ledger Live users to buy bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH), and litecoin (LTC) within the app using Paypal.
 
Ledger Enables Paypal Payments for US Customers to Streamline Crypto Purchases Within App
 
On Wednesday, Ledger revealed Ledger Live users can now purchase BTC, ETH, BCH, and LTC using Paypal. The company believes this offers a “convenient, simple and secure way” to buy digital currencies through its companion application. Users can select Paypal as their payment method in the app’s “buy” section.
 
However, this is available only to users who have previously used Paypal to buy crypto assets. Ledger Live users new to Paypal for crypto “will be required to create a Paypal account or undergo a KYC verification,” according to Ledger. The company directed users to its Help Center for guidance on using Paypal for digital currency purchases.
 
“Both Paypal and Ledger are focused on creating secure, seamless, and fast transactions no matter where you are in the world. Paypal has remained at the forefront of the digital payment revolution for more than 20 years, and we are thrilled to come together in this next period of asset innovation with our integration,” said Pascal Gauthier, Ledger’s chairman and CEO.
 
 
This development comes after Paypal introduced its own stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar, named PYUSD. Though announced, PYUSD hasn’t yet been made available to the general public. Over the past two years, Paypal expanded its crypto services. However, this week, the payment giant paused crypto purchases in the U.K., citing regulatory shifts. The company stated that crypto buying in the United Kingdom would resume in early 2024.

This would see Shiba Inu slide down to the 17th position as selling pressure increased, decreasing the price of the meme token.
 
However, SHIB’s price has reversed since then, and the token has skyrocketed up the rankings again. At the time of writing, SHIB has moved up three spots and is currently ranked 14th in terms of market capitalization.
