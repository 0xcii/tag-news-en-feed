Amid the shadows of their past, they are determined to pave a path towards redemption and restitution for creditors who suffered from the fallout. 
 
During a Twitter Space event, Davies passionately expressed his belief in “karma” driving him to make amends and outlined their novel plan to contribute to creditor recoveries through the proceeds generated by OPNX.
