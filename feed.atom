        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arbitrum (ARB), a prominent Layer 2 scaling solution, is currently grappling with a concerning trend that has sent ripples of unease through its community. 
 
The growth momentum of its native ARB token holders seems to have hit a roadblock, igniting apprehensions about the token’s value and the overall vitality of its ecosystem.
 
Data from Token Terminal shows ARB’s 24-hour, weekly and monthly timeframes in the red, and with a market cap shedding 18%. Its daily active users also show a nearly 10% decline in the last 30 days. 
 
 
The rather stagnant ARB token holder count has the potential to cast a shadow on the token’s intrinsic value and could even impede the expansion of its once-flourishing ecosystem.

However, the nascent stablecoin’s journey has been fraught with challenges, hampering its efforts to carve a significant niche. Critics have pointed to its centralization as a major hurdle in gaining traction.
 
 
Observers note that many tokens appear to be parked within centralized exchanges, with Paxos, the issuer of PYUSD, holding a staggering 90% of the tokens in circulation.
