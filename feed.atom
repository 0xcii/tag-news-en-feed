And with the continued downturn in US economic data, many have been speculating on how cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, would react to this perfect storm brewing.
 
 
Popular analyst Michaël van de Poppe says Bitcoin could very well follow the trajectory of the historic rise of gold during the Great Depression.
 
As views on US debt, inflation, and rising interest rates pile up, Bitcoin is increasingly touted as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Van de Poppe is among the analysts taking the view that Bitcoin will have its ultimate rally very soon and that it will be sustained via rate cuts and quantitative easing policies.
