        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As bitcoin dipped below the $29K threshold and the overall crypto economy experienced a 1.4% decrease to $1.17 trillion, cryptocurrency derivatives markets underwent $92 million in liquidations, primarily in long positions.
 
Cascading Effect: Bitcoin’s Fall Under $29K Sparks $92 Million in Liquidations
 
The crypto economy, along with a significant number of digital assets, faced a decline on the first day of August. The total value of the crypto market fell by 1.4% within the previous 24 hours, landing at $1.17 trillion as of Tuesday morning (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).
 
 
The day’s largest losers included PLS and HEX, two tokens tied to Richard Heart’s projects. In addition, COMP, AAVE, SNX, GMX, and APE sustained losses ranging from 4.87% to 11.35% over the last day.
 
 
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 1.61% against the US dollar, while ethereum (ETH) fell by 1.72%. With its network’s impending halving event in less than 24 hours, litecoin (LTC) managed to ward off losses and maintained a 0.73% increase as of 11 a.m. on Tuesday.
 
Nevertheless, like bitcoin and various other cryptocurrencies, LTC prices slipped throughout the late hours on July 31. According to coinglass.com data, LTC derivatives traders encountered $2.63 million in liquidations, with $1.88 million in long positions.
 
 
Of all cryptocurrency derivatives markets, $92.95 million was liquidated over the past day; bitcoin (BTC) positions accounted for $22.38 million and ETH for $16.73 million in liquidations. XRP saw $4.66 million in liquidations, while CRV registered $5.87 million over the previous 24 hours.
 
Approximately $80.20 million of these liquidations originated from long positions and $12.76 million from shorts. In the last 12 hours alone, there were $13.88 million in liquidations, which included $7.79 million in long positions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana dropped for a third consecutive session on Tuesday, as the token started the month of August nearly 5% lower. Overall, the global market cap was mostly in the red, dropping by 1.44% as of writing. Stellar fell to a one-week low, following a four-day losing streak of its own.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana slipped for a third consecutive session on Tuesday, as the token dropped to a one-week low.
 
SOL/USD hit a bottom of $23.16 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after price peaked at $24.38.
 
Tuesday’s low is the weakest point solana has hit since July 25, when the token traded under the $23.00 level.
 
 
One of the catalysts of this decline appears to be the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a support point at 51.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 48.84, with the next visible price floor at 45.00.
 
There is a strong chance that SOL bears could push the token towards $20.00, should bearish momentum intensify.
 
 
Stellar (XLM)
 
Stellar (XLM) was another notable token to drop on the first day of the new month, edging lower for a fourth straight day.
 
Following a high of $0.1558 to start the week, XLM/USD retreated to a low of $0.1465 earlier in today’s session.
 
This is the lowest point that stellar has hit since last Wednesday, and comes as bears made an attempt to collide with a floor at $0.1445.
 
 
Like with solana, today’s sell-off in XLM was as a result of the RSI breaking out of a floor at the 59.00 zone.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 57.11, with the 10-day (red) moving average starting to point downward, following an extended uptrend.
 
A destination of $0.1250 might be a long-term target, especially in the event of a breakout below $0.1445.

Kusama invited Tesla CEO Musk to the upcoming Blockchain Futurist Conference. The event, taking place on August 15 & 16, 2023 in Toronto, Canada, is expected to unveil the much-anticipated Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s own layer 2 blockchain.
 
Capitalizing on Musk’s recent display of fondness for Canada, Kusama shared the invitation via Twitter: “See you at Blockchain Futurist Conference”. Interestingly, Musk had also mentioned “Shiba Inu” in an earlier tweet, albeit likely in the context of the popular dog breed, alluding to Dogecoin (DOGE), not the cryptocurrency SHIB.

Under fresh tax directives from the IRS, staking rewards in cryptocurrency become taxable income within the United States immediately upon their acquisition by the taxpayer. The instant an owner is granted units of digital assets as incentives for validation, the fair market value of these rewards is to be incorporated into the taxpayer’s gross income during the taxable year in which the individual secures the staking rewards.
