        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OneCoin, the cryptocurrency project that morphed into a notorious pyramid scheme, continues to cast a long shadow. Yesterday, Irina Dilkinska, the former head of Legal and Compliance for OneCoin, was sentenced to four years in prison by US District Judge Edgardo Ramos for her role in the multi-billion dollar scam.
 
 
Dilkinska’s sentencing marks another step in the ongoing legal saga surrounding OneCoin. Launched in 2014 by Ruja Ignatova and Karl Sebastian Greenwood, OneCoin promised investors a revolutionary new cryptocurrency. However, authorities allege that the project was a fraudulent scheme from the outset, designed to enrich its founders at the expense of unsuspecting victims.

This downside has its roots in a number of things, with some attributing directly to the Bitcoin price. However, the outlook for the meme coin may not be completely bleak as time moves forward.
 
Shiba Inu 14% On The Weekly Chart
 
In the last week, the Shiba Inu price has followed the likes of Bitcoin and Dogecoin as they lose the majority of their gains from the prior week.
