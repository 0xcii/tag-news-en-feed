        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grayscale Investments, the renowned digital asset management firm, is yet to receive a decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). 
 
Despite surpassing the customary 160-day review period, market participants eagerly await the next batch review scheduled for Friday at 11 am. 
 
According to finance Lawyer Scott Johnsson, August is a crucial month due to the “cycling” of law clerks in the District of Columbia (DC) courts, leading to the potential clearance of pending cases before the arrival of new personnel. 
 
While the decision could extend into September, Johnson suggests August remains a promising timeframe for a ruling.

Cryptocurrencies present “novel and complex risks” that are difficult to assess amid recent volatility, according to the report. Growth in crypto assets corresponded with more banks expressing interest in crypto activities last year. However, the sector then experienced a crash that exposed vulnerabilities. The FDIC is closely monitoring crypto activities at banks and said additional guidance is likely.

        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-sol-ton-move-to-multi-week-highs-on-tuesday/"/>
        <updated>2023-08-15T16:10:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana was one of Tuesday’s big gainers, rising to a multi-week high following a ‘death cross’ of moving averages. The move came despite the global market cap falling marginally lower as of the time of writing. Toncoin was another notable mover, rising for a sixth-straight day.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) surged higher on Tuesday, as sentiment in the token has remained largely bullish in recent days.
 
SOL/USD peaked at $25.24 during today’s session, which follows up from a low of $24.35 to start the week.
 
This climb saw solana trade at its highest point since July 29, when price reached a high of $25.39.
 
 
The move came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should upward momentum continue to intensify, the next target for traders will likely be around the $26.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $24.82.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was also in the green in today’s session, as the price climbed for a sixth-consecutive session.
 
Following a low of $1.42 to start the week, TON/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1.49 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, toncoin moved to its strongest level since July 23, and closer to a ceiling of $1.50.
 
 
Similar to solana above, the rally came as the 10-day and 25-day moving averages neared an upwards cross.
 
One area of concern for bulls is the current reading of the RSI indicator, which is tracking at 66.91.
 
This is the highest area it has reached in the coin’s history, meaning it is greatly overbought, with bears potentially waiting to take advantage of this.

XRP v. Stellar: MoneyGram Could Tip Balance In Rivalry?
 
Denelle Dixon, CEO of the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), celebrated the deal in an official post. The partners have been collaborating since 2021 and, as a result, developed a crypto-backed product called MoneyGram Access.
 
Dixon emphasized the growth experienced by the XLM ecosystem since its partnership with MoneyGram, claiming that the Stellar network became the “leader of cash-to-crypto on and off-ramps” due to this product. The partners have focused on creating tools to provide people with access to the “digital economy.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several crypto analysts have continued to predict what could trigger the next Bitcoin bull run. This time, co-founder of Delphi Digital Kevin Kelly has weighed in as he believes certain metrics could determine when the next bull run will occur.
 
Bitcoin’s Consistent Four-Year Cycle
 
On August 14, Kelly laid out some analysis in a Twitter thread, pointing out the consistency of past crypto market cycles and how they could impact the market going forward. He says that contrary to public opinion, the crypto market is “quite cyclical” and consistent in certain metrics, which usually mark the beginning and end of a particular cycle. 
 
 
Kelly used Bitcoin as a point of reference to drive home his point of the crypto market being cyclical. He noted that Bitcoin typically follows a four-year c…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://bitcoinist.com/is-dogecoin-gearing-up-for-another-25000-rally/"/>
        <updated>2023-08-15T15:06:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the last crypto bull market, Dogecoin was a clear leader among altcoins and beat Bitcoin by miles in terms of return on investment (ROI).
 
Could this old dog be up to it’s same tricks? The meme coin is mere pennies away from triggering a “parabolic” signal that the last time around resulted in a 25,000% gain.
 
Why Dogecoin Could Become A Bull-Dog
 
Dogecoin has lost a large share of its former value alongside the rest of the crypto industry. This is common during a bear market. But during a bull market, the returns have historically been shocking.
 
 
The meme coin became the poster child of the last crypto bull run, famously being mentioned numerous times during Elon Musk’s Saturday Night Live performance.
 
That event was close to the peak of the previous cycle, and since then has been rolling over and playing dead. Soon, it could bite back. That is according to the Parabolic SAR indicator on the 1M DOGEUSD chart.
 

 
 
DOGE Closes In On Parabolic Buy Trigger
 
The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator created by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. who also created such tools as the Relative Strength Index, the Average Directional Index, and Average True Range.
 
The tool is used to tell a trader or investor that the trend has “stopped and reversed”. If DOGEUSD can tag the Parabolic SAR on the 1M timeframe, it could tell the market that the trend has officially changed.
 
 
The reason this is important, is because Dogecoin is typically an indication that altcoin season is approaching. When it begins to take off, so does the rest of the altcoin market. At least it has always historically done so.
 
A buy signal has only been triggered three times in the past, causing a 500%, 225%, and 25,000% rally, respectively. Will this signal once again prove as reliable as man’s best friend?

During the latest bitcoin bull market, prices for bitcoin mining machines, otherwise known as ASICs, witnessed a significant surge. This was followed by a major crash, bottoming in December 2022. The value of ASICs tend to have a pattern: They seem to be undervalued during bear markets, while enjoying outperformance during bull runs. This pattern points to a potential profit shift when measured in bitcoin terms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin mostly consolidated on Tuesday, as traders anticipated the release of July’s retail sales data from the United States. Sales rose by 0.7%, better than the 0.4% expected, and this comes following a 0.2% increase in June. Ethereum also remained unchanged prior to the data.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) was trading in the red for the majority of the day, as price consolidated prior to the release of U.S. retail sales data.
 
After peaking at $29,660.25 to start the week, BTC/USD fell to a low of $29,272.35 earlier in today’s session.
 
Since moving above $30,000 on August 8, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has mostly trended sideways.
 
 
One reason for a lack of direction appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI) tracking between a support and resistance of its own.
 
The index is currently at a reading of 47.57, and has mostly moved between a floor at 47.00, and ceiling at 49.00 in recent days.
 
For bulls, a breakout above the 49.00 zone will also likely be the straw needed to break the camel’s back.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) has remained largely unchanged in the past few days, rising by 0.11% in the past week.
 
ETH/USD bottomed out at $1,837.21 so far during today’s session, which is almost $20.00 lower than Monday’s high.
 
Price has mostly consolidated around a support point of $1,830 in recent days, however the prospect of a moving average crossover is keeping bullish hopes alive.
 
 
The 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages are on the cusp of an upwards crossover, which could likely send prices above $1,900.
 
Similar to BTC, there will first need to be a breakout above a ceiling on the RSI indicator for this to take place.
 
On this occasion the resistance point is at 47.00, and the index is currently tracking at 45.23.

In the filing made on August 15, Prime Trust, LLC, Prime Core Technologies Inc., Prime Digital LLC, and Prime IRA LLC were named as the entities seeking Chapter 11 relief. 
 
 
The company’s decision was prompted by its recognition of a distressing reality: liabilities ranging between $100 million to $500 million, compared to assets estimated at $50 million to $100 million. 
 
This substantial gap underlines the severity of the financial challenges the company is currently facing.
