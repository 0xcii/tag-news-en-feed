Different analysts have weighed in and given several bullish price predictions on how high the meme coin could rise as this bull run progresses. 
 
Shiba Inu To Hit New All-Time High Soon
 
Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lead Lucie once predicted that the meme coin could hit a new all-time high (ATH) “soon before or shortly after BTC halving.” Back then, she reaffirmed her faith in the second-largest meme coin by market cap, stating that SHIB could pull this kind of “miracle recovery.”

Economist Peter Schiff threw gasoline on the fire by criticizing Bitcoin’s viability as a currency due to rising transaction fees and sluggish processing times.
 
However, the cryptocurrency community swiftly countered his claims, highlighting potential inaccuracies and offering alternative interpretations.
 
 
Schiff, a vocal Bitcoin skeptic, took to social media platform X to express his concerns. He claimed that a single BTC transaction now costs a staggering $128 and takes over an hour to process – a significant bottleneck for any potential widespread adoption as a medium of exchange.

Bitcoin Runes Have Caused A Sudden Shake-Up In Miner Revenues
 
A couple of days ago, the much-anticipated fourth Halving, a periodic event taking place roughly every four years where block rewards that miners receive for solving blocks are permanently cut in half, finally took place on the Bitcoin network. While this was a major event for cryptocurrency, another watched development occurred on the network simultaneously. It was the release of the Runes, a new protocol for minting fungible tokens on the network.
