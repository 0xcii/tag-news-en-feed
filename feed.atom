Brandt’s forecast for ETH, which he shared in a post on X, centers around his belief that ETH lacks the attributes of a solid store of value. Unlike Bitcoin, which has garnered widespread acceptance as a digital gold equivalent, ETH’s functionality and escalating gas fees cast shadows on its long-term viability.
