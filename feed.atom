        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
You may have heard about re-enabling OP_CAT as a potential upgrade for bitcoin's script language. Depending on where you get your news OP_CAT has been called "only 10 lines of code", "the best way to enable experimentation with covenants", "too powerful", "dangerous and leading to miner centralization", or "guaranteed to lead to a contentious soft fork". I'm going to make the case that all of these perspectives are mistaken. OP_CAT is very useful, can be used as a covenant, and not (alone) the best next move for bitcoin. Nothing more, and nothing less.

With centralized platforms still reeling from high-profile scandals like FTX and Celsius, any misstep can send user loyalty plummeting. Nexo, a platform that had recently emerged relatively unscathed, now finds itself in hot water after a surprise fee increase sparked outrage amongst its customer base.
 
 
From Hero To Zero: Trust Eroded By Unannounced Fees
 
Nexo had managed to carve out a niche as a customer-centric exchange. Their ability to dodge legal troubles and a swift reversal of a disliked fee policy in April had painted a picture of a platform that listened. However, this carefully crafted image shattered on May 21st when users woke up to emails announcing a significant hike in bank transfer fees.

Based on his remarks, it could take weeks to months before these funds launch, even if an approval would come this week. 
 
S-1 Filings Need To Be Approved Before Trading Can Commence 
 
Seyffart mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the S-1 approvals are needed before the Spot Ethereum ETFs can go live and that it could take “weeks to months” for this approval to come in. He made this statement while clarifying that their 75% approval odds only related to the deadline for the 19b-4 filings, with VanEck’s and Ark 21Shares’ final deadline coming up on May 23 and 24, respectively.
