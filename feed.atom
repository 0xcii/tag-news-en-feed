Despite the renewed optimism, thanks to Grayscale’s recent victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the price of the premier cryptocurrency has failed to stay above the $26,000 mark.
 
While many investors and crypto enthusiasts hope for a sustained Bitcoin bull run, some believe the cryptocurrency is already in a bull market. According to BitMEX co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes, Bitcoin has been garnering a bullish momentum as far back as March 2023, although the market has “yet to respond.”

“At the DMV, we’re always looking for ways to better serve Coloradans and leverage technology to offer our services,” said Senior Director Electra Bustle. “This new online cryptocurrency payment option is yet another way the DMV is providing innovative and convenient service delivery to our customers.”
Here's how it works: customers just have to select the cryptocurrency payment option, and they will be redirected to PayPal, where they can choose their preferred cryptocurrency to complete the transaction. The selected cryptocurrency is then converted into dollars, covering the total amount due along with applicable fees, before being remitted to the DMV.
However, it's important to note that there is a service fee associated with using cryptocurrency, amounting to $1 plus 1.83% of the total DMV charges. Additionally, PayPal may apply its own fees. As of now, PayPal is the sole cryptocurrency provider accepted for online DMV payments.

In this piece I'm going to focus solely on the issues regarding incentives for brevity's sake.
