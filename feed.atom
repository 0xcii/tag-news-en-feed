        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Commodity money is a form of money that derives an intrinsic value from its underlying commodity and the supply and demand dynamics. Gold and silver have been accepted as commodity money for centuries because of their scarcity and desirability.
Commodity money has some inherent limitations, such as the challenge of transportation and storage of larger quantities. This physical challenge is one of the primary reasons why it was replaced by more flexible solutions like representative and fiat money.
Commodity money is in contrast to representative money and fiat money. Representative money has no intrinsic value but represents something of value — such as gold or silver — for which it can be exchanged.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monetary Debasement
Debasement refers to the action or process of reducing the quality or value of something. In relation to money, it traditionally refers to the practice of reducing the precious metal content in coins while keeping their nominal value the same, thereby diluting the coin’s intrinsic worth. In a modern context, debasement has evolved to mean the reduction in the value or purchasing power of a currency — such as when central banks increase the supply of money, thereby lowering the nominal value of each unit.
Understanding Debasement
Before paper money, currency consisted of coins made of precious metals like gold and silver. Debasement was a common practice to save on precious metals and use them in a mix of lower-value metals instead.

        <updated>2023-10-27T15:54:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toncoin was a notable mover on Friday, as the cryptocurrency edged lower for a second straight session. Price fell by as much as 4% earlier in the day, as price approached a breakout below the $2.00 mark. On the other hand, solana continued to trade around the $33.00 mark.
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin dropped for a second straight day on Friday, as bears pushed the cryptocurrency close to a breakout below the $2.00 level.
 
Following a high of $2.17 during yesterday’s session, TON/USD slipped to an intraday low of $2.07 earlier today.
 
As a result of the decline, toncoin continued to track a one-week low, and close to a key price floor of $2.00.
 
 
One reason TON remains above the aforementioned level is as a result of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is above its own floor at 50.00.
 
In the event that this point is broken, there is a strong possibility that bearish sentiment will significantly increase.
 
If so, traders will possibly be targeting a lower support point of $1.90.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) made slight gains earlier in the day, as the token hovered close to a one-year low above $33.00.
 
SOL/USD rose to a peak of $33.30 during today’s session, after falling to a low at $30.80 on Thursday.
 
Earlier gains have since faded, with the world’s seventh largest cryptocurrency now trading at $32.37.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the 14-day RSI is marginally above a floor at 74.00, with a current reading of 74.43.
 
Should bulls sustain this level, there is a good chance that solana could make another run towards $35.00.
