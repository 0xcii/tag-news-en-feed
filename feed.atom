This surge in attention can be attributed to the concerted efforts of BRICS countries such as Brazil, China, and Russia, who are endeavoring to diminish the dominance of the greenback, preventing it from reclaiming its former position as the alpha currency. Although a prevailing sentiment suggests that the U.S. dollar’s global reserve status is on the brink of dissolution, there are dissenting voices asserting that the hype surrounding de-dollarization has been exaggerated.
