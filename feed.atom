        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin consolidated recent losses on Tuesday, as focus shifts to Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. Traders will look for guidance from the report, to see the Fed’s stance on the economy, after opting to keep rates unchanged last month. Ethereum remains below $1,700 in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade below the $28,000 level on Tuesday, ahead of the release of last month’s FOMC minutes.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $27,715.85 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after hitting a low of $27,302.56.
 
Overall, although mid-term momentum appears to be bullish, bears seem to be looking to hit the $27,000 mark in the short-term.
 
 
The relative strength index (RSI) of 14 days remains on a downward trend, with a current reading at 54.95.
 
This comes as price strength attempts to find a floor, following a move away from a resistance level of 60.00.
 
Currently, BTC is trading at $27,518.86, however volatility will likely increase as we near tomorrow’s economic release.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) remained in the red, following the recent decision by the Ethereum Foundation to trade 1,700 tokens.
 
After a high of $1,596.97 to start the week, ETH/USD retreated to a low of $1,553.01 late in yesterday’s session.
 
This saw the cryptocurrency hit a one-month low, prompting bulls to buy the dip, pushing price to a current reading of $1,580.44.
 
 
From the chart, it seems that the recent decline has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average close to a downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
In the event that this occurs, there will likely be further sell-offs, with ethereum almost certainly falling below $1,500.

Kavuri lost about $2.1 million to FTX and has now become one of the vocal champions of FTX creditors. He describes himself as an FTX creditor activist for his newfound role and is now making rounds of media outlets to share his thoughts on the trial.

Shiba Inu: Shibarium’s Latest Milestone
 
Shiba Inu’s Shibarium has recently reached a significant milestone, recording over a million blocks and over 3 million transactions since it was introduced to the public in late August 2023.
 
 
The platform’s latest achievement might be traced back to the collective Shiba Inu token burn movement. Last month, a prominent Shiba Inu team member Lucie urged investors to migrate from using centralized exchanges and start using Shibarium as it will help with the Shiba Inu token burns.
 
According to blockchain explorer Shibariumscan, Shibarium blocks currently sit at 1,063,594 …]]></summary>

Cowen, sharing his insights on the social media platform X, pointed out that Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance, which represents its total share of the crypto market capitalization, is on the rise. This phenomenon comes as risk appetite for the broader asset class appears to be waning.

BitVM introduces a computing paradigm that can express Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts. The significance here is that it does not necessitate any modifications to the network’s consensus rules.
