        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If passed, the reported amendments would regulate bitcoin and cryptocurrency usage in the African nation.
A local Nigerian newspaper has reported that Babangida Ibrahim, chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Capital Market and Institutions of Nigeria, claimed the country will soon pass a law making the usage of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies legal. The bill would amend the 2007 Investments and Securities Act and would recognize bitcoin as legal capital for investment.
Back in February of 2021, Nigeria effectively banned the usage of bitcoin with a letter prohibiting regulated financial businesses from “dealing” with cryptocurrencies. In the same year, Bitcoin Magazine reported Nigeria soaring to the largest volume of bitcoin peer-to-peer trading in the world, and Chainanalysis reports showed that Nigeria had greatly accelerated bitcoin adoption. 
 
The newspaper report described how Ibrahim pointed to Nigeria being behind in regards to regulation of the industry, saying “Like I said earlier during the second reading, we need an efficient and vibrant capital market in Nigeria. For us to do that, we have to be up to date global practices.” 
If the proposed regulation properly addresses the growing bitcoin usage within the country, it could be a major catalyst for the African continent’s most populated country. 
Bitcoin has had a large presence in the country despite the current ban, including the construction of a Bitcoin village, Nigerian Bitcoiners participating in all sorts of development, philanthropic work from Bitcoin companies and mining being an active industry there.]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s Difficulty Expected to Jump 3% Higher on Dec. 19, Bitcoin Average Mining Costs Are Higher Than the Current Spot Market Value
 
In roughly 24 hours, the Bitcoin network will experience another difficulty transition, and this time around it is estimated to increase. The increase is estimated to be around 3.2% to 3.76% higher than the current 34.24 trillion value. The rise would lift the 34.24 trillion to around 35.53 trillion on or around Dec. 19, 2022.
