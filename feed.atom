        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) has been a hot topic in the cryptocurrency market, especially after its remarkable performance in 2023. However, 2024 has been a rollercoaster year for SOL, marked by significant volatility and uncertainty. Despite efforts to stabilize, including Binance’s announcement of a new staking service for Solana (SOL), the token has struggled to maintain its position above $130. As September unfolds, the big question is whether Solana (SOL) can make a comeback and possibly reach $150. However, analysts remain skeptical about its short-term prospects, especially when compared to the meteoric rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new meme coin that’s capturing the attention of the crypto community.
