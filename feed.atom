        <link href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-xmr-nears-6-week-high-as-link-falls-near-a-resistance-level/"/>
        <updated>2023-03-30T15:39:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monero climbed for a third consecutive session on Thursday, as the token moved marginally closer to a six-week high. This rise in price comes despite the fact that the global market cap mostly consolidated, and is trading just 0.50% higher as of writing. As for LINK, chainlink bulls have so far failed to break out of a key resistance point.
 
Monero (XMR)
 
Monero (XMR) was one of Thursday’s notable gainers, with prices climbing for a third consecutive session.
 
XMR/USD rose to a high of $163.19 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after the token fell to a low of $155.83.
 
As a result of the move, XMR moved towards last Sunday’s high at $166.07, which was its strongest point since February 20.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s move came as monero surged above a recent resistance level at $160.00.
 
Overall, the surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with its own ceiling at the 55.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 54.86, which is its highest reading this week.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
On the other hand, chainlink (LINK) was mostly lower on Thursday, as the token failed to move above a key price point.
 
LINK/USD slipped to a low at $7.25 in today’s session — this comes after prices hit an earlier peak of $7.53.
 
Today’s high saw chainlink move towards its ceiling at $7.55, however bulls were unable to secure a breakout.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the failure to move beyond $7.55 coincided with the RSI falling at a resistance of its own.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 53.16, which is below the aforementioned ceiling at 55.00.
 
Overall, LINK is now trading at $7.32, with sentiment in today’s session now mostly bearish.

‘Trust Us, Bro’ As The Only Tool Left
Banking only works when there is trust. It’s fundamentally based on the belief that the banking system is strong and resilient enough to protect your money.

As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the funding rates are also highly positive right now. The “open interest” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts that are currently open on derivative exchanges. This metric accounts for both short and long contracts.
 
When the value of this metric displays a rise, it means BTC investors are opening up new positions in the futures market right now. Since more derivative positions generally also imply an increase in leverage in the market, this kind of trend can lead to the asset’s price turning more volat…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose above $29,000 on Thursday, as price moved to its strongest point since last June. The surge came despite some consolidation in cryptocurrency markets, ahead of the upcoming U.S. GDP report. Ethereum was also higher, as it continued to trade above $1,800.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved to its highest point in nine months, despite cryptocurrencies mostly consolidating ahead of the upcoming U.S. GDP report.
 
Following a low of $28,155.83 on Wednesday, BTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $29,159.90 earlier in the session.
 
As a result of this surge in price, bitcoin climbed above the $29,000 level for the first time since June 10.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came as BTC briefly broke out of a resistance at $28,500, with the relative strength index (RSI) moving past a similar threshold.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at the 65.27 level, which is marginally above its ceiling at 65.00.
 
Overall, BTC bulls have moved to secure some of their earlier gains, with the price now trading at $28,582.20.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) continued to trade above $1,800 on Thursday, however sentiment shifted after it failed to sustain a breakout at a key point.
 
ETH/USD rose to a high of $1,827.28 on Thursday, which comes less than 24 hours after the price was at a low of $1,776.64.
 
Although marginally moving above its aforementioned ceiling at $1,825, ethereum bulls were unable to maintain upward momentum.
 
 
As of writing, ETH is trading at $1,800.78, which coincides with the RSI hovering around its recent resistance level at 58.00.
 
The index is currently tracking at 58.25, with a move below the 58.00 level almost certainly to trigger further declines.
 
Momentum also appears to be slowing, with the 10-day (red) moving average nearing a downward crossover.
