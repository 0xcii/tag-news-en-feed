        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a groundbreaking development, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee has just passed the “Keep Your Coins Act of 2023,” a landmark bill advocating for the right to self-custody Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The bill aims to ensure that individuals and businesses can store and manage their own digital assets securely, without unnecessary third-party involvement.
 
Bitcoin And Crypto Self-Custody Bill Passes
 
The bill’s primary objective is to prohibit Federal agencies from restricting the use of convertible virtual currency by a person for their own purposes, such as purchasing goods and services, and conducting transactions for any lawful purpose. The legislation also protects the right to self-custody digital assets using a self-hosted wallet or other secure means.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The price of ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is anticipated to hit a high of $2.7K before settling at around $2.5K by the end of 2023, according to the latest report from Finder. The report is based on predictions by a panel of 29 cryptocurrency and fintech experts who also expressed confidence about the long-term growth of the digital currency. Additionally, most panelists believe it’s unlikely the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will classify ETH as a security.

Dogecoin Cools Down After Showing Strong Bullish Momentum
 
Until just a couple of days back, Dogecoin seemed to have finally been putting together some promising bullish momentum, as the asset had managed to breach the $0.083 level. In these past two days, though, the coin has once again slipped up, as its price has registered a notable drawdown.
 
Following the latest 3% decline in the meme coin during the past day, its value is trading around $0.0767. The below chart shows how DOGE’s price has changed recently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shiba inu was a notable gainer on Friday, climbing to a two-week high during today’s session in the process. The move came as the meme coin rose by as much as 6%, despite the global crypto market cap mostly consolidating. Tron rose for a fourth straight session today. 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) rallied to a two-week high on Friday, after breaking out of a key resistance level.
 
SHIB/USD surged to a peak of $0.000008217 earlier in today’s session, following Thursday’s low at $0.000007754.
 
Friday’s move came as shiba inu broke out of a key resistance level at the $0.000008000 mark, hitting its highest point since June 15 in the process.
 
 
Another reason for today’s action appears to be the relative strength index (RSI) moving above a ceiling at 55.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at the 60.09 level, which is marginally below a ceiling at 61.00.
 
Should bulls manage to race past this point, there is a good chance the next target price will be $0.000008500.
 
 
Tron (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) extended a recent bull run for a fourth day, with today’s move taking the token to its highest point since last Sunday.
 
Following a low of $0.08221 on Thursday, TRX/USD climbed to an intraday high of $0.08417 earlier in today’s session.
 
Tron bulls appear to be targeting a resistance level at $0.0860, which was last hit during last Saturday’s peak of $0.0943.
 
 
Since hitting that 20-month high TRX has mostly consolidated, however bullish momentum seems to be gradually returning.
 
This comes after the relative strength index (RSI) moved beyond a ceiling of its own at 63.00, and is now tracking at 64.84.
 
If current sentiment remains, TRX could reach $0.0860 in the coming days.
