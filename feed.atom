Music Industry Misfortune
The music industry is notorious for preying on the artists on which its existence depends. In the early days of recorded music, this exploitation started with unfavorable contracts, depriving musicians of the fruits of their labor while record labels made all the money. The mistreatment has since evolved into the Live Nation Entertainment monopoly, where the company has a nearly exclusive hold on the ticket market (thanks, Ticketmaster!) and an equally tight grasp on the event side, where the company owned at least 259 venues worldwide as of 2021, and where many of their ticketed concerts are held.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US senator Ted Cruz has officially begun accepting Bitcoin for his senate campaign donations, according to his official website, with Bitcoin payments firm OpenNode facilitating the transactions. Payments to the campaign can either be made on-chain or via lightning network transactions.
 
         
         
         
        Bitcoin Campaign Donations Accepted
Ted Cruz for Senate
 
    
Cruz has been a very vocal proponent of Bitcoin in the senate over the last few years, especially when it comes to the energy front, where he says the Bitcoin industry "is generating enormous benefits for Texas, for the country." 
The senator seemingly wants to help lead a charge on educating and bringing more Bitcoin awareness to his colleges in office, alerting that he has "real concern when it comes to congress," because he serves "in the U.S. senate, a body where I'm not sure we have 5 senators that can tell you what the hell a Bitcoin is."
This past April, the sitting senator attempted to bring more BTC awareness to DC as he featured in a fireside chat at the Bitcoin Policy Summit, revealing that he owns "a little more than 2 bitcoin, and every Monday I own a little bit more...I am incredibly bullish on Bitcoin specifically."



Cruz joins a growing list of US politicians starting to accept Bitcoin for campaign donations in 2023. Earlier this year, presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr and Vivek Ramaswamy both starting accepting BTC also through OpenNode for campaign donations.]]></summary>

Previously known for his influential role as the former CEO and Co-CIO of PIMCO, El-Erian shared his insights on how US Treasuries are currently being perceived in the market.
 
Bitcoin Is Perceived “Safe Asset”
 
El-Erian stated, “There have been two big puzzles. They show how unsettling the volatility in the US Treasuries have been. One is, you haven’t had it been the safe haven. We haven’t seen the flight to quality, and the flight to safety you would expect, given what is happening in the world.”

The report suggests that Bitcoin’s historical price movements, particularly its relationship with halving events, make the prediction of a $150,000 price tag by 2025 not as far-fetched as it may seem.
 
One of the central themes highlighted in the report is the cyclical nature of the top crypto’s price cycles. Over the years, it has exhibited four-year patterns that align with its halving events.

Merely having tokens for their sake, or avoiding them without reason, raises immediate red flags. In much of Web3, there's an overflow of tokens made just to have a token.
