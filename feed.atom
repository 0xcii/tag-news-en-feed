        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a strategic move influenced by upcoming general elections, South Korea has decided to delay the implementation of taxes on cryptocurrency gains until 2028. Initially, the government planned to impose a 20% tax on profits from crypto investments exceeding 2.5 million won (approximately $1,875) starting January 2023. This timeline was subsequently pushed to 2025, and now further delayed to 2028. The ruling People Power Party (PPP) argues that establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework is paramount before any taxation is enforced. This approach aims to ensure the stability and security of the crypto market, addressing its complexities and rapid evolution.
What Are the Key Reasons for the Delay?
The main rationale behind the delay is to align crypto tax thresholds with those of stock…]]></summary>

Strong Bullish Indications Despite Market Volatility
 
The soon to launch Ether Spot ETFs in the United States is seen to provide a major boost to the world’s top altcoin in terms of adoption and perhaps price projection.
 
Ethereum futures have been edging BTC in recovering open interest, indicating a strong market narrative supporting Ethereum’s long-term prospects.

        <updated>2024-07-16T14:40:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leading Latin American crypto exchange Bitso has partnered with Lightspark to integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network onto its platform. This will introduce faster, cheaper Bitcoin transactions to Bitso's user base of over 8 million retail clients and 1,700 institutional customers.
Bitso will leverage Lightspark's infrastructure to enable Lightning transfers. Lightspark will host the nodes while Bitso retains control of the private keys in a remote signing setup.
The integration comes as Lightning Network adoption spreads globally, making payments with Bitcoin faster, smoother and less expensive.
According to Bitso's research, 53% of crypto wallets in Latin America hold Bitcoin. Trading pairs against local fiat currencies are also widely used. Thus, Lightning is a natural fit to upgrade Bitso's existing infrastructure.
Daniel Vogel, co-founder and CEO of Bitso, said, "We're thrilled to partner with Lightspark to bring Lightning to our platform. This advances our mission of making crypto useful by delivering faster, more cost-effective, and transparent money transfers."
With Lightning, Bitso can offer near-instant Bitcoin transactions at a fraction of the cost of regular on-chain Bitcoin payments. This unlocks new potential payment and remittance solutions for both retail and enterprise clients.
Lightspark CEO David Marcus said Bitso "shares our vision of building open payments for the Internet. This gets us closer to that goal. We know people across Latin America want this solution."
As a pioneering Latin American exchange with millions of users, Bitso's integration of Lightning is a milestone in increasing Bitcoin adoption.]]></summary>
