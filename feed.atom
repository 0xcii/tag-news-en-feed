This decrease is notable, considering it came after the recent Bitcoin halving event on April 20, which traditionally boosted the cryptocurrency’s value but, this time, failed to counteract the bearish pressures from global economic uncertainties.

Thin Sell-Side, Big Potential Move For ETH
 
Thinning sell-side liquidity, as seen on order books across CEXes, means that few sellers are willing to liquidate. With few sellers on the market, a small upsurge in demand could theoretically see prices skyrocket. 
 
 
Even so, market makers could fill this imbalance by considering how the market works. At the same time, prices are not guaranteed to rally even if they remain as they are. 
 
Unlike new meme coins, for instance, Ethereum is extremely liquid; it is the second largest coin by market cap, only trailing Bitcoin. T…]]></summary>

Bitcoin Halving Effect Settles In On Miner Revenue As Runes Interest Drops
 
A few days back, the much-anticipated Bitcoin Halving went through. Halvings are periodic events coded into the blockchain in which the BTC block rewards are cut exactly in half. They occur every four years, and the newest one was the fourth such event.

As such, the Halvings can be troublesome for this group’s financials, as their revenue undergoes …]]></summary>
