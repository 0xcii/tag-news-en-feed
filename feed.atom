        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a concerning turn of events, Coinbase (COIN), one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, experienced a crash in its application, causing the firm’s stock to rapidly plummet to the $200 level.
 
Coinbase Outage Leaves Users With Zero Balances
 
The Coinbase application crash resulted in users seeing zero balances on their accounts. Reports from users of the exchange on social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) highlighted this issue, with customers voicing their frustration at their inability to reach customer support.
 
 
Coinbase’s official support account on X acknowledged the problem, stating that they were aware of users seeing zero balances and experiencing errors when buying or selling. The exchange assured users that their assets were safe and that their team was actively investigating the issue, promising to provide an update soon. The statement reads:
 

We are aware that some users may see a zero balance across their Coinbase accounts and may experience errors in buying or selling. Our team is investigating this issue and will provide an update shortly. Your assets are safe.
 
Impact On Bitcoin’s Price? 
 
The crash of Coinbase’s app occurred during a significant milestone for Bitcoin, as it surpassed the $60,000 mark and reached a multi-year high of $63,800. The application outage had a noticeable impact on Bitcoin’s price and market volatility. Within minutes of the situation unfolding, the largest cryptocurrency experienced a drop below $60,000. 
 
 
Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong acknowledged the situation on social media platform X, stating that they were facing a large surge in traffic and apologizing for any issues users encountered. 
 
As of now, it remains to be seen what measures the firm will take to address this development and how they will respond to users who experienced zero balances in their accounts.

        <link href="https://www.financemagnates.com//cryptocurrency/binance-faces-regulatory-storm-as-executives-detained-in-nigeria-report/"/>
        <updated>2024-02-28T18:19:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two senior executives at Binance have been detained  
in Nigeria as the country intensifies efforts to curb speculation on its  
currency, the Financial Times reported. The move followed Nigeria's recent ban  
on several cryptocurrency trading websites to address the rapid devaluation of  
the naira and soaring inflation rates.
Cryptocurrency Crackdown in Nigeria
Nigeria's crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges  
stems from concerns over the devaluation of the naira, which has contributed to  
record-high inflation rates nearing 30%. 
Cryptocurrency websites have reportedly become an  
alternative platform for trading and establishing unofficial exchange rates for  
the naira exchange rates. This has prompted Nigerian authorities to take action  
against them.
The executives traveled to Nigeria following the ban  
on cryptocurrency trading websites but were detained upon arrival by the office  
of the country's national security adviser. Consequently, Binance suspended naira trading  
against bitcoin and tether digital coins on its platform. According to the FT,  
the Nigerian authorities seized the executives' passports.
Government's Concerns and Investigation
Nigeria's central bank governor, Olayemi Cardoso,  
expressed concerns about illicit financial flows through cryptocurrency  
exchanges, citing $26 billion passing through Binance Nigeria in one year. The  
government, including anti-corruption agencies and the police, is coordinating  
an investigation into cryptocurrency exchanges.

In addition, he is at the forefront of what he refers to as “ETHGate,” a scandal he claims involves “the highest levels of corruption within Ethereum.” In a series of new statements, he promises to bring significant developments to the forefront of the crypto world.

As the war for global monetary supremacy wages on, you have to assume that the state is actively operating information warfare. This means that the state is operating and acting in order to preserve and expand it’s own power. For that reason, it is sane and reasonable to assume that state operators are in the trenches of Bitcoin attempting to influence public perception, developer activity, and overall bitcoin adoption. If you think this is not happening then you are naive or you’re incentivized to act against bitcoin in a different way. The sabotage of Bitcoin is not some tin foil hat conspiracy, the sabotage of Bitcoin is actively playing out in real time, but the big question is where the sabotage is taking…]]></summary>
