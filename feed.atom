        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FTX verdict is out. US District Judge Peter Castel approved a $12.7 billion deal that requires the failed exchange FTX and its sister trade company, Alameda Research, to pay their debts.
 
 
On August 7, 2024, a verdict was issued that concludes a protracted legal dispute with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which originated after FTX’s sudden decline in late 2022.
 
The deal represents a significant stride in addressing the financial issues stemming from one of the biggest corporate disasters in the history of crypto.
 
With $8.7 billion reserved especially for investors misled by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, the proposed settlement calls for the whole $12.7 billion to be distributed to repaying FTX creditors.
