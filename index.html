                              <span>Bitcoin plunged from a recent fourteen-month high to start the weekend, as traders appeared to have begun securing yesterday’s gains. The decline saw the price fall below $30,000, days after almost moving above $32,000. Ethereum also slipped, however remained above $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $30,000 to start the weekend, as traders began to take profits, following recent highs.
 
After peaking at $31,354.48 on Saturday, BTC/USD plunged to an intraday low of $29,966.39 earlier today.
 
This sees bitcoin retreat from a high of $31,862, which was the strongest level for the cryptocurrency since last May.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the decline was somewhat inevitable, due to the relative strength (RSI) moving into overbought territory.
 
The index rose to a peak of 65.55 on Thursday, before falling to a current reading of 54.17 earlier today.
 
Since this drop, price strength has since stabilized, with BTC now trading at $30,347.59.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also moved lower on Saturday, however traders were able to reject a drop below the $1,900 level.
 
ETH/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,901.36 earlier in the day, less than 24-hours after trading at a top of $2,005.96.
 
Since hitting Friday’s three-month high, bulls have opted to abandon previous positions heading into the weekend.
 
 
The world’s second largest cryptocurrency has since rebounded, bouncing away from a floor at $1,900, and now trades at $1,943.27.
 
This comes as the RSI held firm at a support point around the 55.00 zone, going on to climb to a current reading of 56.79.
 
Overall, the next target could be around the 61.00 mark, and if successfully hit, ETH will likely be back over $2,000.

However, an unfortunate oversight occurred when Adams mistakenly failed to disclose a certain aspect of his involvement with Bitcoin, a misstep that stemmed from his belief that it did not qualify as a security, according to his team.
 
 
Renowned for his outspoken support of Bitcoin, Adams, who previously served as a police officer, wholeheartedly advocates for the widespread adoption of the cryptocurrency. 
 
In a bold move, he even opted to receive a portion of his salaries in Bitcoin, favoring the decentralized digital currency over traditional fiat currencies.

                              <span>Bitcache, a crypto startup backed by Kim Dotcom, has been liquidated, reportedly over unpaid legal fees. Phil Creagh, an Auckland lawyer who acted as Bitcache’s director until Sept. 2020, is reported to have applied for the startup’s liquidation on May 24. 
 
Bitcache’s Unpaid Legal Fees
 
A New Zealand-based crypto startup previously promoted by prominent crypto advocate and entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, has been reportedly liquidated over unpaid legal fees. According to a report by Newsroom, owners of the startup known as Bitcache have not contested the decision to liquidate.
 
The liquidation of the startup, which Kim Dotcom lauded as a platform that would revolutionize the way online content creators get paid, came more than six years after it was launched. Phil Creagh, an Auckland lawyer who acted as Bitcache’s director until Sept. 2020, is reported to have applied for the startup’s liquidation on May 24.
 
 

Commenting on the decision to liquidate Bitcache before it achieved any of its objectives, Creagh said:
 

It’s pretty straightforward, there are fees owed and not paid. The company has not taken any steps so far to avoid being placed in liquidation. We’ll put it in liquidation and see what, if anything, can be recovered.
 
The lawyer added that his firm Anderson Creagh Lai stopped representing the Kim Dotcom-backed startup some time ago.
 
According to the Newsroom report, Bitcache initially hit a major obstacle in early 2017 when the platform’s planned launch was interrupted by what Dotcom referred to as a “hiccup.” Since then, attempts to launch the platform have all failed. The report added that Bitcache, which reportedly last filed a return to the Companies Office in 2021, is now likely to be removed from the Companies Register.

                              <span>Binance reportedly sacked over 1,000 employees in recent weeks, further shrinking its previous 8,000-strong global workforce. The Wall  
Street Journal (WSJ) reported the mass retrenchment today (Friday), citing an  
insider source. 
Binance Cuts More Jobs Globally
Former  
employees told WSJ that more staff members across  
the exchange’s global markets were fired during this week, with customer-service workers mostly  
affected. In India alone, about 40 employees in this category were let go, the outlet said.
The  
downsizing comes as regulatory pressure continues to mount on the exchange,  
which recently endured an exodus of senior  
executives. Already, about 50 employees working for the exchange’s  
so-called independent US subsidiary have been booted out.

                              <span>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has stated that the recent federal court ruling has confirmed that XRP is “not a security”. The ruling provides the digital payments company with greater flexibility to pursue various business opportunities across the globe.
 
Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Garlinghouse expressed relief that the company could now promote the various use cases for Ripple and its technology without the fear of regulatory action. 
 
Ripple CEO Calls Out SEC For Anti-Crypto Stance
 
The ruling signifies a win for the crypto industry over the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which sued Ripple in late 2020. The SEC accused the firm, co-founder Chris Larsen, and Garlinghouse of misleading investors by selling more than $1 billion worth of tokens without registering them.

The ongoing exercise could reportedly result in Binance losing more than a third of its staff. The job cuts come amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry, and just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao.
 
As reported by Bitcoinist, last week several high-level executives also resigned from Binance, including its Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann.
