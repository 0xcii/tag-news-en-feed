This development was confirmed in a court filing on February 18. According to the details, Sam Bankman-Fried, alongside Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, FTX co-founder Gary Wang and FTX’s head of product Ramoc, must appear for a remote deposition on February 23. 
 
In addition, they must produce all requested documents and communications before February 20. The subpoena was served by representatives of unsecured creditors affected by Voyager Digital’s collapse and subsequent bankruptcy.

This article provides a look at my latest research, revealing how it came to be that a 2022 Cambridge Centre For Alternative Finance’s (CCAF) study on Bitcoin’s environmental impact underestimates the amount of sustainable Bitcoin mining going on. I also address why we can be very confident that the actual sustainable energy usage is at least 52.6% of Bitcoin mining’s total energy use. 
Why This Matters

                              <span>The largest marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Opensea, has announced major changes to its fee structure and policies in response to a shift in the NFT ecosystem. The company detailed that it will drop fees to zero for a limited time and offer an optional creator earnings model with a minimum of 0.5% for all collections that do not use onchain enforcement.
 
Opensea Drops Fees While Facing Tough Competition from Rivals Like Blur, Looksrare, and X2Y2
 
Opensea, the NFT marketplace, announced on Friday that it is dropping fees in response to a major change that started in October 2022. “We began to see significant volume and users migrate to NFT marketplaces that do not fully enforce creator earnings,” Opensea said. “Today, that shift has accelerated dramatically despite our best efforts.”
 
Opensea pointed out that roughly 80% of the total ecosystem volume is not paying full creator earnings, and most of the sales volume has moved to a no-fee environment. The NFT market has faced competition recently from the new market Blur, which has captured $1.4 billion in all-time sales volume in a short period. However, Blur’s all-time sales are small in comparison to Opensea’s $34.53 billion in all-time sales.
 
 
The NFT marketplace also faces competition from digital collectible markets Looksrare and X2Y2. Opensea hopes the new changes will strike the right balance of incentives and motivations for all ecosystem participants, including creators, collectors, and power buyers and sellers. Additionally, the company announced it is updating its operator filter to allow sales using NFT marketplaces with the same policies, including Blur. “This is the start of a new era for Opensea. We’re excited to test this model,” the company said.

Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) remained close to a multi-month high on Saturday, following a breakout above a $7.15 resistance level.
 
DOT/USD surged to an intraday high of $7.39 to start the weekend, following a low of $6.71 the day prior.
 
Following Friday’s low, the token rose significantly higher as the day progressed, climbing to a six-month peak of $7.42.

As a result of this move, the 10-day (red) moving average is now nearing an upwards cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
This comes less than a week after a downward cross, however, momentum seems to have already shifted.
 
Should bulls maintain this trajectory, it is likely that $8.00 will be the short-term target.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) also moved higher to start the weekend, with prices climbing to a nine-day high.
 
Following a low of $7.26 on Friday, LINK/USD raced to a peak of $7.71 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move came as chainlink broke out of a resistance level at $7.60, with prices at their strongest point since February 9.

As of writing this, the price strength is tracking at 59.83, with chainlink now trading lower at $7.55.
