                              <span>Bitcoin fell below the $20,000 level for the first time since January, as markets continued to react to the liquidation of Silvergate Bank. This comes ahead of a pivotal U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which could decide how aggressive the Federal Reserve acts in its upcoming meeting. Ethereum moved under $1,400 in today’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell for a fifth straight session on Thursday, as markets continued to react to the Silvergate Bank liquidation.
 
The bank confirmed that it will be winding down its operations, leading U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren to blame crypto as a whole.
 
As such, less than 24 hours after hitting a hit at $21,796.12, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $19,669.92 earlier today.

Following the plunge in the general crypto market, Huobi Token took it a step further with a massive 90% drop in just a matter of minutes. Now crypto community members are on edge, wondering if the crypto exchange would be the next to go under.
 
Huobi Token (HT) Takes A Massive Dump
 
Before the news of the U.S. Attorney General suing KuCoin crypto exchange made the rounds, HT was trending at a price of $4.4 and remained steady. However, as the market declined, HT fell to as low as $0.3, an over 90% decline, before rallying back up to $3.5.
 
 
Its decline placed it among the top losers in the market, coming behind Singularity Net (AGIX) which lost 21.74% of its value in the 24-ho…</span>

A recent survey conducted by OnMessage Inc. in the State of Texas found that men are 30% more likely to own bitcoin than women. And most of those who have attended a Bitcoin meetup will have noticed a majority male attendance. In the Bitcoin space we often say “Bitcoin is for everyone,” however, the statistics show a lopsided participation. 
But Bitcoin is for everyone, right? So, what can we do to make Bitcoin culture more accessible to women? 
There are many potential paths but the one that I am choosing to pursue is to learn from and tell the stories of women in bitcoin. And where better to start than with Lyn Alden, the founder and CEO of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy?…</span>

Is Ether a Security?  

  
Further, it is the first regulatory lawsuit that claims Ether to be a security. The labeling of Ether as a security was based on the Martin Act, a 102-year-old anti-fraud law, as the cryptocurrency&#x27;s market value depends on the actions of others, including its Co-Founder, Vitalik Buterin.  

  
Apart from Ether, the lawsuit classified LUNA and TerraUSD &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.financemagnates.com/terms/s/stablecoin/&quot; class&#x3D;&quot;terms__…</span>

In fact, Shiba Inu is the second-biggest meme coin, and it has an enthusiastic community known as the “SHIB Army.”
 
One of the most significant developments in the Shiba Inu ecosystem is the Shiba Inu Burn initiative, whose main objective is to limit supply of the coins in circulation, create scarcity, and force an increase in the token’s price.
 
Billions of SHIB tokens have just been transferred to dead wallets across 48 transactions on Thursday. As a result, the 24-hour burn rate of the crypto has skyrocketed to the level of almost 30,000%.
