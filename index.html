                              <span>For the longest time, the meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) had been an Ethereum whale favorite. This support was driven by the rapid growth of the cryptocurrency that netted some of these whales millions of dollars in profit. However, with the crypto winter, SHIB has suffered one of the worst declines, causing Ethereum whales to move away from the meme coin.
 
Shiba Inu Falling Out Of Favor
 
At one point, the Shiba Inu holdings of the top 5,000 largest Ethereum whales had reached as high as $1 billion at its peak. Since then, there has been a steady decline in the price of the digital asset and the whales have exited a good portion of their positions over time.
 
 
Even at a time when Ethereum whales were reducing their SHIB holdings, the meme coin had managed to feature in their top 10 holding…</span>

SBF is held in custody at the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services (BDOCS), a jail called Fox Hill that is known for being filthy, and was accused of prison maltreatment last year.

                              <span>The BIS’ Basel Committee introduced a finalized proposal for limits to the amount of Tier 1 capital banks can hold in bitcoin.
The Bank for International Settlements&#x27; (BIS) Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has finalized a proposed policy that would place a 2% limit on banks&#x27; Tier 1 capital held in bitcoin. This comes with an endorsement from the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the oversight body of the Basel Committee, which is the “primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks.”
Investopedia defines Tier 1 capital as “the core capital held in a bank&#x27;s reserves [that] is used to fund business activities for the bank&#x27;s clients. It includes common stock, as well as disclosed reserves and certain other assets.” 
The policy includes bitcoin in its definition of Group 2 crypto assets, saying that “In addition to any tokenised traditional assets and stablecoins that fail the classification conditions, Group 2 includes all unbacked cryptoassets.” It later describes that “a bank’s total exposure to Group 2 cryptoassets should not generally be higher than 1% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital and must not exceed 2% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital.”

The BIS had previously considered a policy of 1% for global banks. In turn, the banks requested a 5% reserve limit. This 2% appears to be a compromise between the two. According to data from 2020, if applied to all banks in the world, who collectively custody approximately $180 trillion, this would amount to a limit of $3.6 trillion in bitcoin held by such entities. 
Tiff Macklem, Chair of the GHOS, stated that “Today&#x27;s endorsement by the GHOS marks an important milestone in developing a global regulatory baseline for mitigating risks to banks from cryptoassets. It is important to continue to monitor bank-related developments in cryptoasset markets. We remain ready to act further if necessary.”</span>

Greenwood, who was arrested in Thailand in July 2018 and extradited to the United States, confessed to the offenses in a Manhattan federal court before Judge Edgardo Ramos who accepted the guilty plea. He is to be sentenced by Judge Ramos on April 5, 2023, DOJ said.
