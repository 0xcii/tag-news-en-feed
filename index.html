JUST IN: Capula Management, Europe&#x27;s fourth largest investment manager, discloses it owns $500 million in spot #Bitcoin ETFs 🇪🇺 pic.twitter.com/AarPOFjrbt
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 5, 2024
  
  
  
The firm reported owning $211 million in Fidelity&#x27;s spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) and $253 million in BlackRock&#x27;s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), totaling $464 million. Capula&#x27;s significant investment in Bitcoin ETFs reflects a further growing acceptance of Bitcoin among traditional financial institutions.
This investment aligns with a broader trend of institutional adoption, as more firms seek exposure to the potential upside of BTC. The SEC&#x27;s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has made it easier for institutions to invest in Bitcoin, providing a more accessible and regulated vehicle for participation in this burgeoning market.
And despite Bitcoin&#x27;s recent plunge from $67,500 to $49,000, large institutions continue to show confidence in Bitcoin. Data from Arkham indicates that major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and MicroStrategy are not selling their Bitcoin holdings, and are likely buying more.

However, Doctor Profit, a well-known crypto expert and enthusiast considering the price movements has identified that Bitcoin is currently trading within a clear price range, suggesting a period of consolidation.

                              <span>If you weren’t there in person, it would be hard to accurately describe how long and winding the line was to see Donald Trump speak at the Bitcoin conference. The wait to even pass through security and find a seat in the auditorium was hours long and thousands of folks were scrambling to find seats at the Nakamoto Stage early in the day. As the line snaked through the expo hall, it was easy to find an even distribution of Bitcoiners and Trump supporters (some were both) all eager to hear Trump speak. There was an excitement in the atmosphere, and while I didn’t share in the excitement, it did permeate the air in Nashville. Uber drivers were quick to point out that Trump was speaking at the conference. Around the city were large images of Trump’s face next to Bitcoin symbols advertising the…</span>

cryptocurrency market is experiencing one of its strongest sell-offs in months  
today (Monday), testing levels not seen since the beginning of 2024. Bitcoin  
(BTC) has shed 25% of its total value in just 4 days, shrinking by $320  
billion. The rest of the cryptocurrency market lost practically the same amount.
Bitcoin and  
Cryptocurrencies Face Strongest Sell-Off in a Year
Bitcoin&#x27;s  
price is falling by nearly 14% during Monday&#x27;s session, testing levels below  
the psychological support of $50,000. This is BTC&#x27;s lowest price point since  
February and marks the fourth day of very strong selling pressure.
In total,  
the price has contracted by 25%, or about $16,000. In dollar terms, $320

                              <span>The Bitcoin and crypto markets are currently experiencing one of the worst days since the FTX crash in November 2022. On Binance, the Bitcoin price plummeted to as low as $49,000, marking a stark 15% crash over the past 24 hours. Similarly, Ethereum has tumbled by 20.4%, Binance Coin (BNB) by 20.0%, Solana (SOL) by 18.4%, and XRP by 17.4%.
 
Crypto Market Crash Is Less Dire
 
However, macro and crypto analyst Alex Krüger believes that the circumstances could be even worse. Krüger’s analysis attributes the severity of the crash not to internal crypto market factors but to broader macroeconomic policies, particularly highlighting the contrasting monetary policies of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.
