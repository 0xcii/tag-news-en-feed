Webassembly Smart Contracts ‘Will Accelerate the Adoption of Web3’

However, the sudden collapse of the exchanges led to the closedown of almost all its branches in many countries. However, the Japanese local regulatory authorities approved the FTX subsidiary in the country to continue some operations. In addition, they permitted the crypto exchange firm to tidy up its withdrawal issues.

Sam Bankman-Fried to Testify Before Congress
 
Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has agreed to testify before the House Committee on Financial Services after the committee’s chair, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, politely tweeted inviting him to testify several times.
 
“I still do not have access to much of my data — professional or personal. So there is a limit to what I will be able to say, and I won’t be as helpful as I’d like. But as the committee still thinks it would be useful, I am willing to testify on the 13th,” Bankm…</span>

                              <span>Roughly 29 days ago FTX filed for bankruptcy, and the crypto ecosystem has been dealing with a rollercoaster ride of market fluctuations and community drama ever since then. Moreover, the now-bankrupt crypto trading platform’s exchange token FTT is still trading above $1 per unit, and it managed to climb 23.4% higher against the U.S. dollar during the past seven days.

For some odd reason, the digital asset ftx token (FTT) is still holding value and on Dec. 10, 2022, it’s been trading for prices between $1.58 to $1.82 over the last 24 hours. FTT is an exchange token associated with FTX from the very beginning, and it was launched more than three years ago in 2019.

                              <span>Uniswap was in the green to start the weekend, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly consolidating. The token rebounded from losses suffered on Friday, moving closer to a key resistance level in the process. Dogecoin, on the other hand, fell lower on Saturday as traders attempted to find a stable point of support.
 
Uniswap (UNI)
 
Uniswap (UNI) was one of Saturday’s notable movers, as prices rebounded from declines suffered the day prior.
 
After sinking to a bottom of $6.10 on Friday, UNI/USD marginally rebounded, climbing to a high of $6.27 in the process.
 
As a result of this, the token moved closer to a key resistance level of $6.35, which was last hit December 5.
 
 
In order to recapture this point, UNI bulls will first need to rise beyond a ceiling of 56.70 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
Currently, the index is tracking at a level of 54.75, which has contributed to the current market volatility, with traders unsure if they should maintain previous positions.
 
However, should we see price strength surge beyond the aforementioned resistance at 56.70, then it is possible that UNI bulls could send prices towards the $7.00 mark.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) on the other hand remained in the red, following a failed breakout of a key resistance point on Friday.
 
Following a move to a high of $0.09858 yesterday, DOGE/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.096 on Saturday.
 
The move comes as the meme coin was unable to surge past its ceiling of $0.0990 during Friday’s session.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this point of resistance coincides with another ceiling — that of the RSI.
 
As of writing, the index is currently tracking at 51.96, which is marginally below a ceiling of 53.00.
 
Should we see this wall broken, it is likely that the meme coin could head back towards the $0.1000 region.

                              <span>Bitcoin started the weekend trading above $17,000, as traders prepare for next week’s U.S. Federal Reserve interest decision. Markets now expect that the Fed could continue hiking rates, following a higher than expected increase in producer prices. Ethereum mainly consolidated on Saturday, as prices moved back towards a key price floor. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) remained above the $17,000 level to start the weekend, despite crypto markets mostly consolidating.
 
BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $17,100.84 during Saturday’s session, which comes a day after hitting a high of $17,280.55.
 
As a result of today’s decline, BTC continued to move below its recent resistance level of $17,200.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it now appears as if bitcoin could be moving towards a floor of $16,750, which comes as market volatility remains high today.
 
The turbulence came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to move between a floor of 50.00 and a ceiling of 52.00.
 
In order for bulls to fully regain market sentiment, a breakout of the 52.00 mark must occur, which could then lead to the return of upwards momentum.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Like bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also consolidated to start the weekend, with price moving close to a key point of support.
 
Following a peak of $1,290.06 on Friday, ETH/USD moved to a bottom of $1,260.82 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s drop, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moved closer to a recent floor of $1,230.
 
 
From the chart, it seems that today’s consolidation comes as bulls failed to break out of a resistance point at $1,300.
 
As of writing, ethereum now seems as though it is heading for its aforementioned floor at the $1,230 point.
 
This comes as the 10-day (red) moving average now appears to have halted recent gains, and is slowly shifting downwards.

                              <span>The bearish trend in the crypto market has been blowing a negative wave. The overall decline is affecting crypto assets and firms in different ways. Following the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, many individual and institutional investors recorded massive losses.
 
Many venture firms invested in the exchanges have counted their losses, while some had to announce non-involvement to encourage their users. Moreover, with the FTX filing of bankruptcy, some affected companies now have little hope of recovering their funds trapped on the platform.
 
 
Yet, the contagion from the failed exchange is still spreading as the latest development reveals the cancellation of sponsorships.
