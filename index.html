During the resumption of the hearing on illegal activities involving foreigners, Sen. Ana Theresia “Risa” Hontiveros presented compelling evidence to support her claims. She showcased videos and reports documenting the recent raids conducted by law enforcement agencies on various commercial and residential properties in Clark, Pampanga.

Since most P2E projects do not create long-playing products, the Free-to-Play model of the past decade is breaking down, threatening to disrupt a $100B+ industry. The main lessons learned before 2023 are:
 
 
NFTs were misused for trading and farming, not for gaming,
 
Pay-to-play model anyway to engage in a full-featured game,
 
Low quality graphics and lack of unique generated content,
 
Farming and breeding decrease economy in a long run,
 
Complex onboarding of Web2 gamers.
 
 
Here’s where Junkineering comes into play, with the goal to improve the model, align incentives between developers and players in a virtuous cycle, as well as deliver a quality product, engaging and Fun-to-Play. The approach they offer is as follows:

The SEC alleged that Ishan Wahi helped coordinate Coinbase’s public listing announcements, which included information about the crypto assets that would be available for trading.
 
Despite being warned not to trade based on this confidential information, Ishan repeatedly tipped off his brother and a friend, Sameer Ramani, about the timing and content of upcoming listing announcements. Ahead of these announcements, Nikhil Wahi and Ramani allegedly purchased at least 25 crypto assets, nine of which were securities, and sold them shortly after the announcements for a profit.
