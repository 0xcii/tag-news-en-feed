Diamond Hands Dominate Shiba Inu
 
In a poll posted by media outlet Cointelegraph on Twitter, the Shiba Inu community showed their commitment to the digital asset. The poll which asked which meme investments people were still holding onto included the likes of DOGE, AMC, GME, and of course, SHIB.

One way to filter out bots is to filter users by those with NFTs, which also weeds out “tourists” who pop in for a quick look and leave without meaningful interaction. In addition, it can be argued that those users with NFTs matter the most, as in a Web3 metaverse like Decentraland, users with NFTs such as ones that denote ownership of real estate in Decentraland (LAND) or wearable items that unlock some of the more popular experiences like ICE poker are the ones who are most active in the platform, and certainly are the most valuable to the ecosystem’s success.</span>

According to several reports, SBF was granted bail and will be able to live with his parents, the two U.S. Ivy League compliance lawyers, in Palo Alto, California. 
 
 
The former FTX CEO was presented in front of a Manhattan court. Here, a federal judge allowed his release where SBF met highly restrictive conditions, such as a $250 million bail and mandatory residency with his parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, both law teachers at Stanford.

Nicolas Roos, Assistant US Attorney, describes the bond as “the
