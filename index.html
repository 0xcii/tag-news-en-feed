                              <span>The CEO of Medici, Edward Boyle, has raised concerns about the low liquidity of Bitcoin (BTC) across leading spot cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. 
 
Boyle believes this could pose challenges for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) providers, especially when they launch in the United States in the coming weeks, subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval.
 
Bitcoin Liquidity On Spot Exchanges Low After FTX Collapse
 
In a post on December 12, Boyle cites Kaiko data that shows that there is generally only $200 million in Bitcoin trading volume within 1% of the spot price. Accordingly, this data means that if a large buyer or seller wants to execute a significant trade, they could impact Bitcoin prices.

EVM Chains Face Surge in Token Inscriptions

                              <span>In a significant development, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) convened with applicants seeking approval for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) today, according to Eleanor Terrett and Charles Gasparino of FOX Business. 



Terrett revealed sources who attended the meeting said the SEC was &quot;making sure everyone is doing cash creates,&quot; and &quot;asked issuers to remove all hints of in-kind redemptions from their filings.&quot; This meeting assumes paramount importance amid the ongoing discussions and evaluations regarding the approval of such ETFs.
Terrett&#x27;s post hinted at the collaborative nature of the meeting, suggesting efforts to bring all stakeholders onto the same page regarding the nuances, prerequisites, and potential implications associated with their spot Bitcoin ETF applications. While details about all the specifics remain undisclosed, the meeting likely focused on addressing concerns, clarifying regulatory expectations, and streamlining the evaluation process for these ETF applications.
The SEC&#x27;s engagement with applicants reflects a commitment to comprehensively assess the viability and regulatory compliance of the proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs. The outcome of this meeting could significantly influence the trajectory of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, potentially paving the way for a more structured framework for institutional participation in this burgeoning industry. 
As market participants await further developments, this meeting stands as a crucial milestone in the potential approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Yesterday, FOX Business reported that BlackRock made receiving an approval for their spot Bitcoin ETF a &quot;key corporate priority,&quot; and that the ETFs will have a SEC decision by January 10.</span>

                              <span>In a recent development surrounding the downfall of cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), a court has issued a significant worldwide asset freeze worth $1.14 billion on the fund’s co-founders. 
 
The order, issued by a court in the British Virgin Islands, comes as part of the liquidators’ efforts to recover the fund’s assets and provide returns to its creditors. According to a Barron’s report, the freeze affects co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, as well as Davies’ wife Kelly Chen.

                              <span>In a recent interview with Fox News, renowned economist Harry Dent issued a dire prediction for the global economy, forecasting 2024 to be the year of the most significant financial crash in living memory. Citing a combination of overvalued markets, excessive stimulus spending, and artificial inflation of asset prices, Dent’s analysis paints a grim picture of the near future. With his reputation for contrarian yet often accurate forecasts, Dent’s warnings carry weight in financial circles.

The Messari seventh annual crypto report titled “Crypto Theses for 2024” is a 200-page report covering a range of topics from Layer 1 blockchains to decentralized finance (DeFi), among other things. However, the Cardano community was quick to notice that the network was not mentioned and has taken to social media to demand answers.

                              <span>Phantom, the Web3 cryptocurrency wallet initially developed for Solana, has expanded to include Ethereum and Polygon, and is now introducing support for Bitcoin, Ordinal inscriptions, and BRC20 tokens. Users of Phantom have the ability to integrate their existing bitcoin wallets, allowing them to manage their Bitcoin-centric digital collectibles and fungible tokens through the Web3 platform’s interface.
 
From Solana to Bitcoin: Phantom Wallet’s Latest Expansion Embraces Inscriptions and BRC20s
 
In 2023, Ordinals and BRC20 tokens, developed atop Bitcoin, have gained considerable traction, leading numerous companies to adopt the supporting infrastructure. As of December 21, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain boasts over 50 million inscriptions.
 
On Wednesday, Phantom, the Web3 wallet that secured $109 million in Series B funding from key investors last year, announced its foray into the Bitcoin realm. Phantom acknowledges Bitcoin’s foundational role, stating that without it, there would be no Solana, Ethereum, or Web3.
 
“Introducing Bitcoin on Phantom,” the company said in a post shared on X. “You can now buy, sell, trade, transfer, and HODL Bitcoin, Ordinals, and BRC20 tokens with your favorite multi-chain wallet.”
 
Phantom’s integration of Ordinals and BRC20s coincides with a surge in demand for Bitcoin digital collectibles and fungible tokens. Recent data from cryptoslam.io reveals that Bitcoin-based NFT sales have exceeded $400 million in the past week.
 
Phantom’s Bitcoin feature is currently in beta and available on an opt-in basis. Users can also link with the NFT marketplaces Magic Eden and Unisat, and Phantom indicates that additional “trusted” applications will be introduced shortly.
