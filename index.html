For 38 days FTT remained above the $1 per unit area up until Dec. 19, as the token suddenly crashed below the $1 region during the mid-afternoon trading sessions, slipping to a low of $0.89 per FTT at 2:30 p.m. (ET).

                              <span>Litecoin snapped a recent bear run on Tuesday, as cryptocurrency prices moved marginally higher. The token was up by nearly 3% in today’s session, ending a six-day losing streak in the process. Chainlink was also in the green, as it rebounded from a key support point.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) snapped a six-day losing streak on Tuesday, as prices rose by as much as 3%.
 
LTC/USD moved away from a one-month low of $61.00, hitting a high of $65.60 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move came as bullish pressure intensified once the token hit a key support point of $63.50.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also rose, moving away from its long-term floor of 33.50.
 
Since moving away from yesterday’s six-month low, the index is now tracking at the 37.46 mark.
 
The next visible resistance seems to be the 46.00 level, and if hit, LTC will likely be trading above $70.00.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) was another notable gainer in today’s session, as prices surged to a four-day high.
 
Following a low of $5.75 to start the week, LINK/USD climbed to a peak of $6.10 earlier today.
 
This rally has pushed the token to its highest point since Friday, when it was trading at a top of $6.54.
 
 
Similar to litecoin, today’s move saw prices move away from a four-week low, rising from a recent floor in the process.
 
LINK rallied at the $5.80 support, which came as the RSI rose above a ceiling at the 37.00 level.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 39.81, with LINK/USD trading at $6.06.

                              <span>Bitcoin linked to the now-defunct QuadrigaCX exchange has been identified to be on the move. The bitcoins which had been previously thought to be inaccessible were mysteriously moved out of multiple wallets, sparking speculations on who might have access to the wallets.
 
$1.7 Million Leave Dormant Addresses
 
The collapse of the QuadrigaCX exchange, Canada’s largest exchange at the time, saw a lot of users lose their money. While the majority of the losses were attributed to mismanagement by funder Gerald Cotten, a good portion of it was actually because the wallets of QuadrigaCX were said to be inaccessible as it was believed that he had taken the private keys to the grave with him after his death in 2018. However, much of what was believed has now been turned on its head as five wallets…</span>

FTX CEO To Be Extradited
 
A week after the crypto wunderkind was arrested in his Bahamas apartment complex, the 30-year-old disgraced CEO has accepted to stand trial in New York.
 
According to the New York Times, Bankman-Fried was charged with wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and election finance violations.
 
A defense lawyer for the FTX CEO, Jerone Roberts, told The New York Times that they are preparing the necessary documents for his extradition. Roberts noted:
 

Mr Bankman-Fried wishes to put the customers right, and that is what has driven his decision.

                              <span>The deal will involve NYDIG taking ownership of miners, with the aim to lessen chances of a bankruptcy.
Greenidge Generation, a bitcoin miner operating in New York, has reached a restructuring agreement for the $74.4 million debt with its lender, NYDIG.
The restructuring will involve NYDIG purchasing 2.8 exahash per second (EH/s) of Greenidge’s bitcoin miners, which Greenidge will host for NYDIG. This would eliminate $57-$68 million of debt, leaving Greenidge with approximately 1.8 EH/s of its own miners, while requiring that the mining firm also pledge the rest of its unencumbered assets to secure the remainder of the loan.
According to the released term sheet, “The Company’s average monthly cash burn rate during October and November 2022 was approximately $8 million, of which approximately $5.5 million per month was associated with principal and interest payments to NYDIG. Further, the Company expects to have a similar cash burn, and similar payments to NYDIG, during December 2022.”
Previously, Greenidge began sounding the alarm in regards to their financial standing due to the amount of cash they were burning, indicating that at such a speed they would run out of money by March 2023. 
Bitcoin miners have been hit hard with old bull market orders getting fulfilled and new contributions to increasing hash rate, all while the price of bitcoin held by the miners plummets. In effect, they mined high and sold low.</span>

 Prices are down heavily, and confidence is devastated, so you’d be forgiven for thinking that this is a year to forget and one that will go down in the crypto history books as having been relentlessly bleak.
 However, if we imagine looking back from a few years down the line, might it be possible that not all of the recollections are negative, and could there be some specks of light that will also gain recognition?
