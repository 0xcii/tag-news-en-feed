The transaction, which involved transferring the funds into cryptocurrency, is believed to have been an attempt to circumvent US sanctions.
 
Crypto Company Copper Technologies Under Fire
 
According to a report by The Guardian, Mikhail Klyukin faced sanctions due to his role on the supervisory board of Russian lender Sovcombank, following the invasion of Ukraine and the US’s targeting of “elites close to Vladimir Putin.”

Focus On Optimism And Manta: What’s Going On?
 
Taking to X on December 20, Kiepuszewski observed that some layer-2 solutions, such as Manta and Optimism, rely on sequencers to post data to Ethereum. However, without fraud-proofs, there is no way to verify that the data published by the Sequencer on the Ethereum mainnet is accurate or complete. 
 
In the co-founder’s view, whenever a sequencer posts the batch of transactions on the main net, there is no layer-1 state or event change. Per Kiepuszewski ‘s assessment, this is …</span>

This pro-XRP legal expert, however, thinks otherwise as he provides a different perspective on XRP’s relatively tepid movement. 
 
XRP Holders Need Deeper Conviction
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bill Morgan said that convictions (likely in reference to XRP holders) need to be “deeper than a day, week, or month of price action.” He mentioned how he doesn’t read much into a month’s price action in the crypto market. 
 
 
Before then, the legal expert had highlighted how XRP’s price action hasn’t been great, as it is down over 2% over the last month. Although the 2% drop seems to be significant to Morgan, he was choosi…</span>

                              <span>In a recent development in the high-profile case of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, a request for postponement of the sentencing hearing was firmly denied by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan. Bankman-Fried’s legal team had sought a four to six-week adjournment, citing the need for additional preparation time. However, the court’s refusal to grant this extension marks a significant moment in this ongoing legal saga.
 
Sam Bankman-Fried Sentencing Date Proceeds as Kaplan Denies Delay

However, this has not discouraged users who believe that Dogecoin payments are coming to X, one of whom is MyDoge Wallet CTO Alex Lewis.

Solana and Avalanche Make Strong Comeback in Crypto Market
 

 
Following the collapse of the Terra blockchain and the FTX failure, SOL and AVAX suffered substantial declines against the U.S. dollar. These cryptocurrencies, once ranked among the top ten, were briefly ousted from their elite top ten status.
