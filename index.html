US-based digital trading platform Uphold has entered into a sleeve sponsorship  
deal with Burnley FC. Uphold’s logo will appear on the left sleeves of  
Burnley’s shirts for the 2023-24 season, according  
to a statement published on the club&#x27;s website.
This move reportedly positions the digital  
trading platform to gain substantial brand exposure through LED advertising  
boards surrounding Turf Moor, the club’s football stadium, as well as across  
Burnley’s social channels and media backdrops. The UK-based football club has more than 800,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter).

Bitcoin Cash Traders Return To Profits As Whales Ramp Up Activity
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Bitcoin Cash traders who bought within the past 30 days, as well as those who did so in the last 365 days, are in profits after the latest surge in the cryptocurrency.
 
The relevant indicator here is the “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio,” which measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the realized cap. The realized cap refers to a capitalization model for BTC that considers the acquisition or buying price of any coin in the circulating supply as its true value, rather than the spot price.

                              <span>Bitcoin edged lower once again on Thursday, as traders continued to capture profits following gains on Tuesday. The latest drop followed data revealing U.S. gross domestic product growth in the second quarter that undershot expectations. Ethereum likewise declined, dipping under $1,700.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was in the red for a second consecutive session, as a mixture of profit-taking and general bearish sentiment impacted price.
 
Following a peak of $27,490.77 on hump day, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,069.21 earlier today.
 
The sell-off comes a few days removed from bitcoin moving above $28,000, following Grayscale’s court win against the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC).
 
 
On a technical note, the decline coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failing to move beyond its ceiling at 53.00.
 
As of writing this, the index is now tracking at a reading of 47.50, with the next visible floor at the 43.00 level.
 
Should momentum push price strength to this point, there is a good chance that the price will drop below $27,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) was back in the red on Thursday, with price falling below the $1,700 level.
 
ETH/USD dropped to the bottom of $1,697.15 earlier in the day, which comes following a high of $1,721.62 the day prior.
 
Like with bitcoin, the decline appears to be a result of profit-taking, after ethereum surged to a multi-week high on Tuesday.
 
 
In order for bulls to maintain the momentum from earlier in the week, a breakout will need to occur at the 49.00 level on the RSI.
 
Price strength is now tracking at 45.65, with price back above $1,700.

times of crisis. As traditional markets fluctuate and global events cause waves

recent events that have put Bitcoin&#x27;s role to the test, as well as its behavior  
as an alternative investment during times of economic uncertainty.
Bitcoin, also  
known as &quot;digital gold,&quot; has gained popularity as a potential hedge

The event secured a total investment of 51,556,343 USDT from 34,587 participants. This development followed a period of increased activity on LBank, largely due to the IEO’s specific participation rules.
 
Earlier in the year, LBank reported a 4.6% market share, placing it in the 5th position for spot trading volume according to CMC data. Additionally, earlier in the year, the platform established a significant presence in the MEME coin sector, reaffirming its position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Kraken Blacklists South Africans
 
According to a report by local media outlet Moneyweb, crypto exchange Kraken has stopped accepting deposits from its users in South Africa. This decision was made because Kraken’s banking partner placed the country on its anti-money laundering blacklist. 
 
Something similar happened earlier this year when USDC’s issuer, Circle, halted fiat payments from users in the country. It is believed Circle had made that decision in anticipation of greater financial sanctions on the country.

Hong insisted that the perceived delay helps to ensure that South Korea’s regulatory regime will be in sync with any internationally agreed framework.
 
Korea’s Position at the ‘Forefront of Global Technology Adoption’
 
Hong also told Bitcoin.com News that when South Korea’s crypto regulatory framework is in sync with those of its peers, this may make it possible for the Asian country to foster a “more standardized and interoperable landscape for crypto assets.” When asked about how South Korea has made itself one of the world’s leading cry…</span>

and Markets Authority (ESMA) believes so and suggests that the associated risk  
level will continue to rise. The regulator provides eight reasons to support  
its thesis while also drawing attention to the growing cybersecurity problem in  
EU countries.
Eight Reasons Why Crypto  
and AI Are Dangerous, According to ESMA
ESMA  
recently released its second &#x27;Trends, Risks, and Vulnerabilities (TRV) Report&#x27;  
for 2023. The report delves into various financial market trends, including
