Bennett mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the recent “relative weakness” suggests that the crypto market, including Bitcoin, will get “hammered” if the stock market rolls over. The analyst made this statement based on the correlation between the stock and the crypto market. He had also noted that things weren’t great for the crypto market, especially considering that the S&amp;P, Nasdaq, and other stocks have been enjoying an upward trend for weeks.

The case (4:18-cv-06753-PJH), presided over by Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton has been closely monitored by the XRP community due to its potential implications for the classification of the digital asset under US securities law.
 
Here’s What The Ruling Means For XRP
 
Judge Hamilton’s ruling granted Ripple’s summary judgment motion, dismissing both federal and state class claims that XRP was sold as an unregistered security. Fred Rispoli, a vocal pro-XRP lawyer, explained the significance of this via social media: “Win for Ripple in the Oakland class action.

BREAKING: $800 billion Standard Chartered Bank is building a spot #Bitcoin trading desk - Bloomberg
Gradually, then suddenly 👏 pic.twitter.com/iwmjFcHgBd
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 21, 2024
  
  
  
According to recent reports from Bloomberg, the new London-based Bitcoin trading desk will start operations soon and be part of the bank&#x27;s FX trading unit. Standard Chartered has been positive on Bitcoin for years and is now moving to meet surging institutional demand.
Standard Chartered said, &quot;We have been working closely with our regulators to support demand from our institutional clients to trade Bitcoin and Ether.&quot;
The bank already offers crypto custody through its stake in Zodia Custody. It is also an investor in Zodia Markets, which trades institutional Bitcoin and crypto. This bolt-on trading desk represents the next phase in Standard Chartered&#x27;s Bitcoin push.
The move comes as Bitcoin ETFs gain approval and launch across major markets like the US, UK, Hong Kong and Australia. With institutional appetite growing, banks realize they must adapt to remain competitive.
Standard Chartered&#x27;s offering of direct Bitcoin trading capabilities reflects the accelerating mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. It indicates that banks consider Bitcoin a crucial new asset class they can no longer avoid. 
This infrastructure buildout will, in turn, enable wider institutional adoption. Other major banks will likely follow Standard Chartered&#x27;s lead in rolling out spot Bitcoin trading.</span>
