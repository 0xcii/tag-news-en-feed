                              <span>Worldcoin (WLD), one of the big data altcoins led by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, has put on a tremendous show over the last few days. The WLD token went from a low of $2.2 at the start of last week to peaking above $8 as of Monday, February 19. This translates to an over 200% rally in the space of a week.
 
Most of WLD’s push has come as a result of Sam Altman announcing OpenAI’s new text-to-video tool called SORA. So, as WLD continues to ride the coattails of this AI bullishness, here are the top 3 altcoins that could mount a similar rally.

FixedFloat Hit By Major Crypto Hack
 
According to the Officer’s Notes, the hacker responsible for the attack drained 1700 ETH from FixedFloat, with the funds subsequently transferred to an address on the Ethereum network. Additionally, the hacker managed to siphon off approximately $21 million worth of BTC.
