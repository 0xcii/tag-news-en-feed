                              <span>Following the announcement on July 27th at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville, the “Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide” or BITCOIN Act of 2024, introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, seeks to firmly establish Bitcoin as a strategic asset in the United States’ financial arsenal. At its core, the Act proposes the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) and a structured Bitcoin Purchase Program, and comprehensive national custody policy. While the bill is quite brief, what follows is a breakdown of the Act&#x27;s key provisions, their implications, and the innovative funding mechanisms employed.

                              <span>Bitcoin&#x27;s recent price action has been a rollercoaster of highs and lows. However, even though bitcoin has set a new all-time high and had two years of a near-constant positive trajectory, we&#x27;re yet to see a consistent influx of retail investors. The potential for a surge in retail participation and the possibility of elevating the bitcoin price to unprecedented levels are prospects that many investors are anxiously anticipating. In this article, we&#x27;re going to explore when we might see these retail investors dive back into the bitcoin pool and whether their return could indeed propel BTC to even greater heights.

                              <span>Multisig is a familiar concept for most in Bitcoin: a multisig transaction requires approval from multiple parties before it can be executed. We distinguish between &quot;n-of-n&quot; multi-signatures, where the number of involved parties is n, and they all need to approve, and &quot;t-of-n&quot; threshold signatures, where only a smaller number t of participants need to approve. Cryptographic schemes like MuSig, MuSig-DN and MuSig2 for multi-signatures and FROST by Komlo and Goldberg for threshold signatures can reduce transaction cost and improve privacy of multisig wallets.
So far, in the Bitcoin Community FROST has only been used in experimental implementations. In this post, we explain why this is the case and how we aim to advance FROST in a Bitcoin production environment through our recent publication …</span>

However, Marty Party, host of Crypto Traders Club Space has shed light on the issue of failed transactions on the Solana blockchain, addressing widespread worries among users.
 
Most Failed Transactions On Solana Originates From Error Code
 
In an insightful post on Thursday, macro alpha, Marty Party, provided much-needed clarity on the problem of unsuccessful transactions on the Solana blockchain. Marty Party emphasized that these transaction failures are caused by multiple factors, such as the network’s high throughput and periodic congestion.

                              <span>In a significant move among major Wall Street banks, Morgan Stanley will soon allow its financial advisors to offer Bitcoin ETFs to certain clients, CNBC reports. Starting Wednesday, the firm’s 15,000 advisors can pitch BlackRock&#x27;s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity&#x27;s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund to eligible clients.

BREAKING: Morgan Stanley tells wealth advisors they can pitch #Bitcoin ETFs, CNBC reports. pic.twitter.com/2tgSeR2yEm
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 2, 2024
  
  
  
Morgan Stanley&#x27;s move is in response to high client demand for Bitcoin. However, the bank is still maintaining a cautious approach to Bitcoin: only clients with a net worth of at least $1.5 million, a high-risk tolerance, and an interest in speculative investments are eligible for bitcoin ETF solicitation, sources told CNBC. These investments are limited to taxable brokerage accounts, not retirement accounts. The bank will monitor clients&#x27; Bitcoin holdings to prevent excessive exposure to this volatile asset class.
Other major banks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, continue to restrict their advisors from pitching bitcoin ETFs unless clients explicitly request them, the report stated.
This decision marks a significant step towards institutional adoption of bitcoin in traditional finance. Morgan Stanley&#x27;s offering of these ETFs reflects the growing integration of Bitcoin into mainstream finance and sets a precedent for other wealth management firms to follow.</span>

Over 379 Million SHIB Tokens Burned In July
 
Shiba Inu’s burn tracker Shibburn revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that 379.5 million SHIB tokens were burned in July. However, this marked a 58.57% decrease from the previous month, when over 918 million SHIB tokens were burned. Meanwhile, going down memory lane, data from Shibburn shows that over 410.7 trillion tokens have been burned from Shiba Inu’s initial supply.

to 8% in after-hours trading yesterday (Thursday). This decline followed the company&#x27;s

Operational Issues Impact Revenue
The company reported revenue of $145.1 million, missing the

to operational issues that affected its bitcoin mining capabilities and the

MiCA Regulation Requires Authorization
The European MiCA Regulation will come into force on 30  
December 2024, requiring all market participants who wish to offer crypto-asset

The regulation covers ten specific services: managing and

                              <span>On the main stage of Bitcoin 2024, Rep. Wiley Nickel (D-NC) shared that he’s working to have the Democrats shift to a more pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto stance.
He told the audience at the event that he’d recently written a letter to the DNC signed by 28 Democrats, 14 of which are in Congress, advocating for a new approach to digital asset policy from the party and its presidential nominee.
Rep. Nickel explained that the new approach should include “pro-digital asset language in the party’s platform, selecting a vice presidential candidate sophisticated in digital asset policy, selecting a pro-innovation SEC chair, and engaging with the industry in a meaningful way.”
We followed up with Rep. Nickel in efforts to learn more about how he plans to get the Democrats on the Bitcoin bandwagon.

                              <span>Worldcoin, which once made headlines for its futuristic vision, is now at the center of turmoil. This time, conflict is making news, not innovation. Sam Altman of OpenAI’s cryptocurrency project is at the heart of this tempest as it struggles to accomplish its ambitious goal of a worldwide digital identification system.
 
 
Concerns about token dilution, market manipulation, and legal obstacles have put the project—which aims to scan irises for digital IDs and reward participants with free WLD tokens—under close investigation.
 
The Dilution Dilemma
 
The crypto community has opposed Worldcoin’s tokenomics. With just 2.7% of its total WLD tokens in circulation, the project’s completely diluted market valuation is shockingly $22.4 billion, while having a current worth of $648 million.
