The US Fed Should Cut Interest Rates
 
Zandi mentioned during an interview with Bloomberg that he believes the Fed should be looking to cut interest rates. He made this remark while stating that the financial conditions are where they need to be with the Fed achieving its goal of bringing inflation down to a considerable level. He also alluded to the employment rate, which shows that the US Fed shouldn’t hold out on interest rates for this long.

Bitcoin ETFs: The Most Successful ETF Launch in History

Expanding Services in Ireland
The VASP license indicates that Crypto.com meets the standards  
for compliance procedures. This includes measures for anti-money laundering  
 and combating the financing of terrorism. These measures are  
important as cryptocurrencies are often used to bypass laws and sanctions.
Crypto.com serves a global customer base of 100 million  
people. The company aims to enhance its offerings in Ireland with this new

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 11, 2024
  
  
  
As of June 11, Metaplanet holds approximately 141 Bitcoin acquired for ¥1.45 billion at an average per-bitcoin price of ¥10,278,391 ($65,000). The firm adopted Bitcoin as its treasury reserve asset in April 2024 with an initial ¥1 billion purchase. It has made several buys since.
Metaplanet&#x27;s stock rose 10% following its latest million-dollar Bitcoin acquisition, the third such purchase in just 7 weeks. The company&#x27;s share price has increased nearly fivefold since first announcing its Bitcoin strategy in April, validating its Bitcoin pivot.
By accumulating Bitcoin, Metaplanet aims to hedge against Japan&#x27;s massive national debt burden and rapidly devaluing yen currency. The firm is closely following MicroStrategy&#x27;s influential Bitcoin corporate treasury playbook.
For Japanese investors, owning Metaplanet shares provides exposure to Bitcoin&#x27;s upside without incurring Japan&#x27;s tax on crypto unrealized gains, which can exceed 50%. Metaplanet also enables access to Bitcoin without regulatory hurdles by trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The embrace of Bitcoin by public Asia-based companies like Metaplanet further legitimizes Bitcoin as a solid treasury reserve asset. Firms across continents are now awakening to Bitcoin&#x27;s promise as an inflation hedge and store of value asset in their balance sheet.</span>
