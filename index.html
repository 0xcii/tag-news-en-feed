                              <span>Tron moved closer to being in the cryptocurrency top 10 on Wednesday, as the token rose for a second straight day. Prices climbed by nearly 2% in today’s session, despite the global market cap moving marginally lower. Polygon, which currently occupies the tenth position, fell to a five-month low. 
 
TRON (TRX)
 
TRON (TRX), rose by as much as 2% on Wednesday, as the token moved closer to entering the cryptocurrency top 10.
 
Following a low of $0.06841 on Tuesday, TRX/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $0.07031 earlier in the session.
 
As a result of this jump, TRX is now marginally above a long-term resistance level of $0.070.
 
 
It appears that the target for bulls could be to not only break this ceiling, but move to $0.072, which would see the token hit a three-month high.
 
One of the main obstacles preventing this is the relative strength index (RSI), which is currently tracking at 59.67, below resistance at 60.00.
 
If and when price strength moves beyond this point, there will likely be more bulls reentering the market.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) which is currently the world’s tenth largest cryptocurrency, fell for a fifth straight day.
 
MATIC/USD plunged to a bottom at $0.866, less than a day after the token was trading near $0.90.
 
This latest decline in price has pushed polygon to its lowest point since January 11, when it traded at $0.84.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this spell of sell-offs has sent the RSI below 30.00, which is deep in oversold territory.
 
The last time price strength tracked this low was back in July 2022, which may give bulls optimism that a reversal could be soon approaching.
 
MATIC is now trading at $0.8723, which is marginally higher than its earlier lows.

                              <span>On May 9, digital currency fund manager Grayscale Investments announced the establishment of the Grayscale Funds Trust and submitted registration filings for three exchange-traded funds with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Grayscale Introduces Grayscale Funds Trust and Files for 3 ETFs
 
As the leading digital currency fund manager, in terms of assets under management (AUM), Grayscale Investments unveiled the Grayscale Funds Trust launch. The trust is a Delaware statutory trust structure designed to strengthen the company’s worldwide asset management capabilities. “A registration statement relating to Grayscale Funds Trust has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective,” Grayscale stated on Tuesday.
 
Grayscale highlighted that they had previously established Grayscale Advisors, an SEC-registered investment advisor, which will serve as the new trust’s advisor. Besides the trust, Grayscale has also filed a registration statement for three additional funds. These newly launched funds consist of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, and Grayscale Privacy ETF.
 
Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in a statement: “The creation of Grayscale Funds Trust reflects our dedication to scaling Grayscale’s business responsibly,” adding that “we are putting the necessary foundations in place so Grayscale can continue creating and managing regulated, future-forward products.”
 
 
Moreover, Grayscale announced that David LaValle, the company’s global head of ETFs, would assist with their expansion. “It has been incredibly exciting to build our ETF franchise – hiring a dedicated team, expanding our partnerships, and enhancing our position within the ETF ecosystem,” LaValle said.

                              <span>Crypto investors have been called out by United States President Joe Biden for using unspecified tax regulations https://thebittimes.com/biden-denounces-wealthy-crypto-investors-access-to-tax-loopholes-tbt47101.htmlto circumvent the law, prompting his call for an end to such practices.
 
Biden posted an infographic on Twitter that reads:
 

“We think Congress should cut tax loopholes to make crypto investors rich… MAGA Republicans think Congress should cut food safety inspections ($15 billion).”
 
According to the infographic, such adjustments would ostensibly save the government $18 billion. However, Biden did not specify which tax exemptions would be closed by reforms to generate these savings.

According to the infographic, the American government is missing out on $18 billion due to crypto-related tax loopholes. The tweet is also a battle cry from US Democrat Biden to Republicans, whom he accuses of wanting to waive food safety controls for the sake of protecting wealthy crypto investors.
 
Unsurprisingly, the tweet has been met with fierce opposition in the community. While some community members doubted the veracity of the figure, Scott Melker wrote that Biden should first return his campaign donations from FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried before makin…</span>

The lead singer said it was timed to give fans a chance to get comfortable with Web3 technology ahead of the group&#x27;s 2023 tour, when the NFT holders can use their Deathbats for early access to tickets. M. Shadows also talked to hosts Andrew Hayward and Stephen Graves about AI and bringing Web3 into gaming.</span>

                              <span>When Web3 bug bounty platform Immunefi launched two years ago, CEO and founder Mitchell Amador says the bug bounties weren&#x27;t great and adoption was slow. But the tides started to turn because even if exploiting a smart contract nets a bigger payday than a bounty, it comes with a huge drawback. &quot;There&#x27;s a ton of risk when you engage in this, you know, wantonly criminal behavior and steal $200 million from someone else,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s no way someone&#x27;s not going to come looking.&quot;</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s no doubt that the SEC dealt Kraken—and the outlook for crypto staking products in the U.S.—a big blow when it announced a $30 million settlement and ordered the company to stop offering the service to its customers in the states in February. Now Marco Santori, the company&#x27;s chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: &quot;Kraken&#x27;s master account application has not yet been rejected.&quot;</span>
