                              <span>Coinbase, a prominent crypto exchange headquartered in the United States, has debunked allegations that it was instructed by the Nigerian government to prevent its citizens from using its crypto trading services.
 
The denial came directly from Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, who addressed the issue through a post on X. Armstrong clarified that Coinbase’s services are still operational in Nigeria, with no interruptions reported.
 
 
Armstrong emphasized that Coinbase has not been approached or contacted by Nigerian officials regarding such directives.
 
 
This is inaccurate WRT Coinbase as far as I can tell. 
Coinbase products are still operating (no interruption) 
We haven’t received any outreach or communication from officials in Nigeria

                              <span>Dogecoin has seen abysmal performance in the last year, even while the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum went on to hit new yearly highs. On the back of this poor performance, other altcoins have been creeping up in their market cap to challenge Dogecoin’s position in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap list. And now, after another week of stalling behind the market, Dogecoin has lost its position on this list.
 
Dogecoin Loses 10th Spot To Tron (TRX)
 
Justin Sun’s Tron and its native TRX token have been on a bullish run over the last year. It has risen almost 200% from its 2023 lows of $0.05, and this has sent its market cap rocking. At the same time, the Dogecoin price has failed to follow this growth path, and has instead stalled.

                              <span>On Thursday, February 22, Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms, along with industry groups Texas Blockchain Council (TBC) and the Chamber of Digital Commerce, initiated legal action against key agencies of the Biden-Harris Administration. The lawsuit targets the US Department of Energy (DOE), the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), challenging the administration’s recent steps to gather detailed energy consumption data from the cryptocurrency mining sector.
 
The legal complaint arises from a January decision by the OMB, which approved an emergency request by the EIA to collect data on energy usage from 82 Bitcoin mining operations, including that of Riot Platforms. This move has been criticized by the plaintiffs and supported by United States…</span>
