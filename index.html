                              <span>Based on recent data, the surge of bitcoin beyond the $41,000 mark has triggered a significant increase in trading activity originating from South Korea.

BlackRock recently filed an amendment to its S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). One of the highlights of this latest amendment was the fact that the asset manager seeded the ETF back in October. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas also noted this development in a recent X post while stating how insignificant the seeding fee of $100,000 was.

Raising Awareness About the TON Blockchain
 
Kucoin Ventures, the investment arm of the cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin, has partnered with The Open Network (TON) Foundation and is set to provide a considerable grant to support the growth and expansion of the TON ecosystem. According to a press statement, Kucoin Ventures’ support is set to be allocated to five “TON-based mini-apps” focused on payments or Gamefi that push the boundaries of what’s possible in Web3.
 
Projects based on the TON ecosystem, such as the Future3 Campus and the TON Bootcamp, are in line to receive a portion of the grant. The grant is also expected to bolster marketing initiatives aimed at raising awareness about the TON blockchain.
 

 
Commenting on his organization’s partnership with Kucoin Ventures, the Accelerator Head at TON Foundation, Ian W, said:
 
“Today’s partnership with Kucoin Ventures is an acceleration point in the momentum of mini-app development on The Open Network. With powerful programs like the Future3 Campus Bootcamp and this support from Kucoin Ventures, we’re fueling real-world blockchain solutions in payments and gaming within the TON ecosystem.”
 
According to a statement by the TON Foundation executive, Kucoin Ventures’ efforts conform to TON’s vision of a digital future that is more accessible and decentralized.
 
Alicia Kao, Managing Director of Kucoin, said her organization’s alliance with TON “aligns with our mission of promoting further development of the crypto and blockchain industry through tighter cooperation.”

Ebtikar criticized the SEC for allegedly fabricating dangers to secure a restraining order against crypto firm DEBT Box. In the case, Federal Judge Robert Shelby recently expressed doubts over the SEC’s conduct, suggesting the agency presented false evidence to freeze DEBT Box’s assets.
 
In July 2023, the SEC accused DEBT Box of offering unregistered securities and defrauding investors of at least $49 million. The S…</span>
