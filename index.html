                              <span>Samson Mow, a Bitcoin influencer and the CEO of JAN3, recently made waves with his predictions on the future price of Bitcoin. He shared his outlookᅳbullish for the price trajectory of Bitcoinᅳin a post on the social media site X (formerly Twitter) recently.
 
 
According to Mow, Bitcoin is at its “sale” moment, telling people that prices below $100,000 are what smart investors want. He quoted, “Any price below $0.1M is still #Bitcoin on sale,” insinuating that when Bitcoin reaches this price, the sale will then come to an end.

$67,300 Could Prove Pivotal To BTC’s Price — Here’s Why
 
In a new post on X, prominent crypto pundit Ali Martinez has put forward an exciting projection for the price of Bitcoin over the next few weeks. This bullish forecast is based on the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Pricing Bands, which allow users to estimate price levels where the market would be at an extreme unrealized profit (high values) or unrealized loss (low values).
