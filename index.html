frozen up to $1.14 billion in assets belonging to the founders of Three Arrows

Crypto Founders&#x27; Assets  
Frozen amid Hedge Fund Collapse
The freeze  
comes as Three Arrows Capital faces liquidation. The firm was once one of the  
largest crypto-focused hedge funds before a series of risky bets led to its  
demise last year, amid a broader crypto market rout.
According  
to liquidator Teneo, the freeze order was issued by a British Virgin Islands  
court. Teneo estimates that 3AC creditors are owed about $3.3 billion. The  
liquidator alleges that Zhu and Davies should be held responsible for the hedge

As Scottish economist and philosopher David Hume observed in A Treatise of Human Nature, nothing we know about what is true can tell us what ought to be true and nothing we know about what ought to be true can tell us what is true. The world of objective fact and moral truth are entirely separate. Hume called this the is/ought problem and his argument that descriptive and normative reasoning should be separated is known as Hume’s guillotine. 
Hume’s guillotine is a philosophical razor – a rule of thumb for reasoning about the world. It is a way of cutting apart two lines of reasoning that become entangled when they intertwine. An argument where one side argues about what is true and the other side argues about what ought to be true is a useless argument. Thos…</span>

Bitcoin 4-Year Cycles Have Followed An Interesting Pattern
 
In a new post on X, cycle analyst Root has shared a Bitcoin chart that breaks down the phases that the cryptocurrency’s price has gone through over the different 4-year cycles.
 
In order to separate between bullish and bearish periods, the analyst has made use of an on-chain indicator called the “short-term holder cost basis.” Now, what do these terms mean?
 
 
First, the short-term holders (STHs) refer to the fickle-minded side of the BTC market who buy and sell often. Typically, the investors who bought within the last six months are included in this cohort.
