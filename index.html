The report, released on September 12 as the second part of its 2023 Crypto Market Manipulation Report, sheds light on the rampant practice of “wash trading” in these supposedly trustless platforms.
 
 
The Enigma Of Wash Trading
 
Wash trading, an illicit trading strategy where a trader simultaneously buys and sells the same asset, artificially inflates trading volumes and creates a false impression of market activity.

                              <span>In a significant development, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for  
the District of Delaware has granted crypto exchange FTX permission to sell,  
invest, and hedge its crypto holdings, valued at over $3.4 billion, to settle  
outstanding debts. 
This ruling comes after FTX&#x27;s legal team filed a request for  
authorization to engage in the sale of the digital assets, citing the benefits  
of hedging crypto assets and generating returns from staking certain digital  
assets for the estates and creditors.
Judge John Dorsey presided over the court hearing, where he not only approved the motion but also overruled objections raised by two parties opposing the plan. This pivotal decision allows FTX to initiate the process of selling, staking, and hedging its substantial crypto holdings.

company marks ten years in the industry, bringing together Huobi&#x27;s mission,  
TRON token, and the essence of a crypto exchange.
The rebranding choice of  
&quot;HTX&quot; carries significance, the exchange explained. Breaking it down, &quot;H&quot; pays  
homage to Huobi, &quot;T&quot; symbolizes TRON, and &quot;X&quot; represents the essence of an exchange. This combination of &quot;HT&quot;  
and &quot;X&quot; depicts HT as the platform&#x27;s native cryptocurrency, while &quot;X&quot; represents  
the Roman numeral for 10, acknowledging HTX&#x27;s ten years in the industry.
