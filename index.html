                              <span>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says the enforcement action against Binance has allowed the crypto industry to “turn the page.” He emphasized: “There are many, many companies in crypto that are helping build the crypto economy and update our financial system globally. But many of them are still small startups, so I think getting regulatory clarity is going to help bring in more investment in the crypto space.”

The CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN), Brian Armstrong, discussed the crypto industry outlook following Binance’s settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) during an interview with CNBC on Monday.

                              <span>A CryptoQuant analyst has shared a chart for the Bitcoin mining hashrate and has termed it the “most impressive in the world of BTC.”
 
14-Day SMA Bitcoin Mining Hashrate The Most Impressive Chart For This Quant
 
The “mining hashrate” refers to a metric that keeps track of the total computing power the miners have currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
When this metric goes up, the existing miners will expand their facilities, and new ones will join the network. Such a trend implies that these chain validators are finding the blockchain attractive to mine right now.
 
 
On the other hand, a decline in the indicator suggests some miners are disconnecting their rigs from Bitcoin, potentially because they are finding the coin unprofitable.
