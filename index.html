Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), the cryptocurrency exchange announced today  
(Monday). Bybit will now transition from being a key ecosystem partner to an  
advisory role, a move expected to catalyze further growth in Dubai&#x27;s burgeoning  
crypto and Web3 sectors.
Advisory Partner 
The newly elevated partnership, effective from August  
2024 through July 2025, will allow Bybit to step into its role as DMCC&#x27;s  
Ecosystem and Advisory Partner. This expanded role involves offering strategic  
guidance to the DMCC Crypto Center and its network, underpinning the shared  
mission to advance Dubai&#x27;s position in the global crypto arena.
A major aspect of this partnership includes the  
co-organization of two significant industry events: a global hackathon and a  
flagship conference. The hackathon aims to foster innovation by supporting  
developers in creating web3 projects. 
The past year has witnessed notable achievements,  
including a $100,000 prize pool hackathon designed to support blockchain

His statement came via a post on X, emphasizing the crucial roles of privacy and decentralization in maintaining a “free and open society.”
 
“Zcash is one of the most important and underrated crypto projects in the world today. It brings privacy and decentralization to money, two fundamental building blocks of a free and open society. That’s why I’m supporting Shielded Labs and its contributions to Zcash. Onward!” Tyler wrote.

                              <span>Marathon Digital Holdings, one of the US&#x27;s largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners, announced plans to raise $250 million through a private offering of convertible senior notes. The funds will be used primarily to expand Marathon&#x27;s Bitcoin holdings.

BREAKING: 🇺🇸 MARATHON DIGITAL HOLDINGS TO RAISE $250 MILLION TO BUY MORE #BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/6NKbfyDPvh
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 12, 2024
  
  
  
The Nevada-based company operates a fleet of miners, producing around 579 bitcoins in July. Marathon&#x27;s balance sheet contains over 20,000 Bitcoin worth over $1.1 billion.
Earlier in July, Marathon bought $100 million worth of Bitcoin on the open market as part of its long-term &quot;hodl&quot; strategy. The company said it will hold all newly mined Bitcoin as reserves.
This latest move to raise capital for direct Bitcoin purchases mirrors the strategy pioneered by MicroStrategy. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has issued debt and sold shares to accumulate more than 220000 Bitcoin in corporate treasury. 
Marathon aims to position itself atop the nascent but rapidly evolving Bitcoin mining and services industry by aggressively expanding its Bitcoin stack. 
This fundraising approach allows public equity investors indirect exposure to Bitcoin. With growing adoption from firms like Microstrategy, Semler Scientific, and Metaplanet, bitcoin is emerging as a corporate treasury asset class.</span>
