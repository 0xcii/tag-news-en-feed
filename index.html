                              <span>Bitcoin fell to a one-week low on Apr. 19, as markets moved into consolidation following a recent bull run. Following today’s red wave, prices neared a breakout below the $29,000 level earlier in the session. Ethereum also declined, falling below $2,000.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved lower on Wednesday, as markets began to consolidate following recent gains in price.
 
Following a high of $30,470.30 on Tuesday, BTC/USD dropped to a bottom at the $29,102.17 mark earlier in the day.
 
The low sent bitcoin to its lowest point since April 10, which is when price was last below $29,000.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Overall, it appears that today’s sell-off took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell below a floor at 59.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 54.97, with the next visible point of support at the 55.00 mark.
 
Should this level be hit, there is a good chance that BTC will be trading around a floor at $28,600.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, Wednesday’s red wave also pushed ethereum (ETH) lower, with the price dropping below $2,000.
 
ETH/USD hit a low of $1,967.17 earlier today, which comes less than 24 hours after it traded at a peak of $2,121.53.
 
The move came as ethereum fell below its recent price floor at the $2,030 level, with some eyeing a lower floor at $1,830.

Ultimately, ETH was relatively overbought in recent days, with the RSI hitting a reading above 75.00 to start the week.
 
This led to bears reentering the market, which have now pushed price strength to a current reading at 55.00
 
A floor at 51.00 could be the target for sellers, which would almost certainly see ETH trading under $1,900.

                              <span>The success of AIDOGE on the Arbitrum network has brought about a new meme season on the Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. The result of its rally has been multiple new coins coming out of the blockchain as they try to leverage this newfound liquidity. In this report, we take a look at some of the promising meme coins that have been making a splash.
 
PufDAO (PUF)
 
For PufDAO (PUF), this meme coin was launched two days ago and it seems to play into the 4/20 meme on Twitter. However, unlike other 4/20 meme coins that have arisen during this time, PUF has seen a reasonable level of success.
 
 
After launching at a price of $0.0000002101, the meme coin knocked off two zeroes by early Wednesday to reach an all-time high of $0.00002123, according to data from Dextools. This put its market cap at i…</span>

                              <span>Anthony Scaramucci of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital got burned by Sam Bankman-Fried: he co-hosted SALT conferences with FTX and sold a 30% stake in SkyBridge to FTX Ventures. And yet &quot;The Mooch&quot; tells Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott &quot;I&#x27;m more bullish now than I have ever been&quot; on crypto as an investment case. He discusses his frustration with SBF, how wrong he thinks politicians like Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler are about crypto and how to regulate it, what he sees happening next with adoption, and talks about Trump.
