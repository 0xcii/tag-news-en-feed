U.S. Consumers Rely on Credit Cards to ‘Navigate Costs Associated With Inflation’
 
While the most recent consumer price index (CPI) report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates a cooling of inflation in the United States, Americans have turned to credit cards to offset the rising prices.

However, updated monthly charts for Gold (XAU) and the US dollar via the Dollar Currency Index (DXY) could provide early confirmation that something special is brewing.
 
All That Glitters Is Not Gold: Why Bitcoin Is Ready To Shine
 
Beginning with the precious metal once backing the entire financial system, let’s take a closer look at the long-term Gold versus Bitcoin chart.
 

 
 
Observing the 1-month XAUBTC chart above, which quotes the price of Gold in Bitcoin, we can see that the June monthly candle is pushing beyond the Bollinger Band basis line.

                              <span>Bitcoin jumped to a one-year high to start the weekend, as the token climbed above $31,000 late on Friday night. After starting the month mostly in the red, prices have strongly rebounded this past week, rising by as much as 15%. Additionally, ethereum was briefly back above the $1,900 mark. 
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) bulls once again controlled market sentiment, pushing price above the $31,000 level late on Friday night.
 
After an earlier low of $29,927.28, BTC/USD moved to an intraday peak at $31,389.54 as the session matured.
 
This saw bitcoin climb to its highest level since June 6 last year, when price traded above the $31,400 mark.
 
 
Since reaching this peak, BTC has somewhat slipped, with the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a ceiling at 73.00.
 
The index now sits at a reading of 72.53, which is still deep in overbought territory, and could entice more bears to consider an entry.
 
A recent crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages remains the main indicator highlighting the potential for more gains.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) briefly returned above the $1,900 level in the last 24 hours, however bulls here have been unable to sustain momentum.
 
ETH/USD surged to a peak of $1,932.53 last night, however entering the weekend, price has since fallen back below that point.
 
 
Currently, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency is trading at $1,888.03, which is marginally higher than Friday’s low at $1,865.19.
 
A key reason for the turbulence remains the fact that price strength has been unable to move past a ceiling at 61.00.
 
Currently ethereum’s RSI is tracking at 59.81, however a potential upwards cross of its moving averages could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.
 
In the event that this occurs, chances of an ETH move above $2,000 will greatly increase.

In violation of a prohibition, the Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) has accused Binance of offering and providing exchange services in Belgium.
 
 
These services involve transactions between virtual currencies and legal currencies, as well as custody wallet services, originating from countries outside the European Economic Area, according to the regulator’s statement.
 
This recent action by Belgium follows reports of a French investigation into Binance and a confirmed visit from French authorities.

According to a recent court filing mentioned in a Bloomberg report, Celsius creditors have amended their lawsuit in the United States District Court of New Jersey, claiming that Wintermute colluded with Celsius executives in manipulating the price of CEL, the platform’s native cryptocurrency, through illicit market trading practices. 
 
These allegations have added another layer of complexity to the ongoing legal battle surrounding Celsius and its downfall.

                              <span>Authorities in Australia have charged two individuals accused of operating a cryptocurrency scam that defrauded two companies of $5.5 million. Luxury vehicles worth $2.7 million including a $600,000 Ferrari have been seized by law enforcement. 
 
Ferrari Seized From Car Dealer
 
Australian authorities have charged two alleged masterminds of a cryptocurrency scam that defrauded $5.5 million from two unnamed companies, a report has said. One of the men, Fabio Sa Alves, was arrested on June 16 in Sydney, and a day later, 6 luxury and classic vehicles, 11 motorcycles, cryptocurrency wallets, and designer watches were confiscated.
 
According to a local report, law enforcement agencies have seized luxury vehicles valued at $2.7 million, including a Ferrari worth $600,000 taken from a car dealer in Marrickville. Australian law enforcement said Alves used the crypto scam to steal from the two companies in 2021. His accomplice, an unnamed 67-year-old, is accused of authorizing the funds and hiding the Ferrari.
 

 
Residents Told to Deal With Approved Exchanges Only
 
For his actions, Alves has been charged with three counts of “dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception” and for attempting to conceal the stolen funds. A court in Parramatta has since rejected Alves’ bail application and his next appearance is set for Aug. 24. However, Alves’ accomplice was granted bail by a court in Manly.
 
Meanwhile, Gordon Arbinja, the Financial Crimes Squad Commander Detective Superintendent, told residents looking to invest in digital assets to work with approved crypto platforms.
 
“When buying or selling crypto, make sure you use a digital currency exchange that is approved by AUSTRAC and always scrutinise all the details,” Arbinja reportedly said.

Bitcoin has held its place as the preeminent digital, robust and unhackable store of value for nearly a decade. Yet, every year, the debate continues about whether bitcoin should evolve to become something more. Can “digital” gold also be the world’s currency? Could Bitcoin’s blockchain be used to register assets of value? Should it?
This conversation has peaked with the launch of Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, driving even more demand to the Bitcoin blockchain. And understandably so — Bitcoin’s peerless security and stability made it known as the blockchain of value. Now that it …</span>

According to Schiff, the current surge in BTC price is merely a temporary thing, and he believes that “the party” will soon come to an end.
 
Schiff’s skepticism stems from his belief that cryptocurrency lacks intrinsic value and is merely a speculative asset. As a gold bug, he advocates for investing in precious metals like gold, which he considers to be a more stable and reliable store of value.

The BCH surge also comes with a notable surge in open interest, signaling renewed investor interest in the altcoin that promises cheaper transaction fees and scalability than Bitcoin, the parent blockchain whose scalability remains limited.
