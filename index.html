Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin’s current price is situated within a 24-hour range of $43,412 to $44,243, reflecting short-term volatility. The leading crypto asset has seen a 1.1% decrease over the past day, though it maintains a 2% increase over the week and an impressive 19.6% rise over the last 30 days. Presently, oscillators provide a nuanced view of BTC’s market momentum and potential shifts.

These new regulations apply to Bitlicensees and limited-purpose trust companies and include business model considerations for virtual currency entities (VCEs), updated risk assessment expectations for VCEs, new advance notification requirements, and updated definitions.

The acquisition of the VASP license from the French regulatory authority establishes Coinbase as an acknowledged and adherent participant in the French financial sector.
 
Based on trading volume, CoinGecko ranks Coinbase as the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, with only Bybit and the similarly registered Binance surpassing it.
