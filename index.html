                        <summary class="article-expander__title">Despite the prolonged crypto winter, proponents of cryptocurrencies are bullish about the industry’s prospects. And so far this year, they have had cause for happiness. 
After a dismal 2022, the price of Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, has been inching upward over the past few weeks. 
According to data from Coingecko, Bitcoin is trading at $22,709 at the time of writing, an increase of 15% over the past week. 
However, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon remains unconvinced. In fact, he has never been. As far back September 2017, the chief executive had maintained an antagonistic stance against Bitcoin. 
 
 
Will Bitcoin ‘Blow Up?’ 
He minced no words during the time about the crypto by saying Bitcoin “is a fraud” and will “blow up.” 
Dimon stated that he would terminate any JPMorgan traders who engaged in cryptocurrency trading “in an instant.” He provided two reasons: “It is against our policies, and they stupid, and both are dangerous.” 
Fast forward, six years, the banking giant top honcho is still at it and criticizing the crypto. In the wake of the market’s troubles following the demise of FTX, he asserts bitcoin is a hoax and reiterates his opposition to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. 
Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon dismissed cryptocurrencies as having no real worth. 
Is It A ‘Waste Of Time?’ 
In an interview, he stated, “I believe all of that to be a waste of time, and I don’t understand why you guys waste any breath on it.” The CEO noted that Bitcoin is a “hyped-up hoax” and a “pet rock.” 
While discussing the properties of blockchain and ledger technologies that JPMorgan believes can be used as a form of currency, he expressed skepticism that Bitcoin is truly a store of value: 
“How do you know that Bitcoin’s supply will reach 21 million? Perhaps it will reach 21 million, at which point Satoshi’s image will appear and laugh at you all.” 
JPMorgan and Dimon have embraced blockchain technology since 2017, when JPMorgan was one of 86 companies that helped launch The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, an open-source blockchain effort. 
Why Many Support Bitcoin 
Technololgy aficionados, libertarians distrustful of government monetary policy, and speculators attracted to its price fluctuations are among those who favor bitcoin, despite the fact that banks have mainly shied away from it since its emergence in the wake of the financial crisis. 
 
 
 
 
Inflation is still significantly beyond the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 2% objective, and interest rates are anticipated to surpass 5%, therefore Dimon has a pessimistic outlook for the American economy this year. 
Dimon stated that one of the greatest threats to the global economy is the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has disrupted supply lines and driven up global energy costs.</summary>

Over the course of 2022, ransomware actors have managed to extort at least $456.8 million from victims, Chainalysis revealed in a report published Thursday. The estimated amount is down from $765.6 million the year before, the analytics company pointed out, noting that the true total is likely much higher, as many crypto addresses controlled by attackers have yet to be identified.

                              <span>An Indian government official says that there is currently nothing that outlaws crypto in India “as long as you follow the legal process.” Meanwhile, the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has stressed that “cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value.”
 
Indian Government Official on Crypto
 
Indian government official Rajeev Chandrasekhar talked about cryptocurrency Thursday at an event in Bengaluru. Chandrasekhar currently serves as both India’s Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology and Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. He is also a member of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament.
 
He explained that India has no issue with cryptocurrencies if all laws are followed, Reuters reported, quoting him as saying:
 

There is nothing today that outlaws crypto as long as you follow the legal process.
 
The Indian government has not yet established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. In December last year, the government told parliament that crypto legislation “can be effective only with significant international collaboration.” Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said the government plans to discuss crypto regulations with the G20 countries.
 
However, crypto income is already taxed at 30% in India, and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) is levied on crypto transactions. Earlier this month, the government revealed that it is launching a crypto awareness campaign.
 
Meanwhile, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has recommended a complete ban on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week that “Cryptocurrency does not have any underlying value,” warning that “it will undermine the authority of the RBI and lead to the dollarization of the economy.” He even expects crypto to cause the next financial crisis if it is not banned.

JPMorgan’s CEO on Bitcoin and Its Supply Cap
 

 
The CEO of global investment bank JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, reiterated his skepticism about bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Thursday. The JPMorgan executive claimed:
 

Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud. It’s a pet rock.
 

 
Regarding the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Dimon commented: “I’m not surprised at all. I call them a decentralized Ponzi scheme. The hype around this thing has been extraordinary.”
 

 
Dimon also reiterated his doubt about BTC’s 21 mi…</span>
