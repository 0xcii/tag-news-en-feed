How XRP Price Will Rise To $18
 
Dark Defender stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the XRP price could extend toward $18.22 when Wave 3 occurs. He believes that Wave 3 will initially cause XRP’s price to rise to between $1.88 and $5.85 and could then further move to the $18 price level thanks to the Fibonacci levels, “which can extend exponentially.”

                              <span>In an astonishing move, Bitcoin’s price has surged past the $47,000 mark, a feat that has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. This significant price movement can be attributed to three key factors: the influx of investments into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), notable activities in the futures market, and a technical breakout from a period of compression. Here’s an in-depth look at each of these contributing elements.
 
#1 Bitcoin ETFs See Record Inflows
 
The market observed a remarkable influx of $403 million into spot Bitcoin ETFs on February 8, signifying the third-largest single-day net inflow despite a withdrawal of over $101.6 million from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Since the launch of these ETFs on January 11, the total inflow has surpassed $2.…</span>
