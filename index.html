It has been revealed that SBF used a virtual private network (VPN) to watch the Super Bowl through a foreign subscription service he had purchased before his arrest. Prosecutors, however, are skeptical and argue that VPNs are commonly used to access international crypto exchanges that are blocked in the United States.

                              <span>Polygon has extended recent gains, with prices climbing to a fresh ten-month high during Friday’s session. The token has now risen for a fourth consecutive session, and is up 13% from the same time last week. Polkadot also rallied on Friday, colliding with a key resistance level in the process. 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) rose for a fourth consecutive session on Friday, pushing prices to a fresh ten-month high.
 
Following a low of $1.36 on Thursday, MATIC/USD rallied to an intraday high of $1.48 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move pushed polygon to its strongest point since April 22, when prices were at a peak of $1.50.
 
Overall, this latest rally comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) raced past a higher ceiling at 70.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 73.23, which is its highest reading since late January.
 
Should momentum continue in this direction, there is a good chance that MATIC could move back above $1.50.
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) also surged in today’s session, as prices ran into a key resistance level earlier in the day.
 
DOT/USD hit a peak of $6.80 on Friday, which comes less than 24 hours after it traded at a floor of $6.31.
 
This resulted in polkadot breaking out of a long-term resistance point at the $6.75 mark, four days after trading at support of $6.15.
 
A major contributor to the move was the fact that the RSI moved beyond a ceiling at 58.00, and it is currently tracking at 59.02.
 
DOT bulls likely have a target of $7.00 in the coming days, with an upcoming resistance of 62.00 on the index a possible banana skin.
 
As of writing, polkadot is up almost 9% from the same point last week.

technology has transformed our understanding of money and value. It has created  
an entirely new decentralized, secure, and transparent digital asset class. 
Many people,  
however, still regard blockchain technology as merely a tool for cryptocurrencies.  

In reality,  
blockchain technology has the potential to transform traditional finance  
through the tokenization of real-world assets, in addition to digital assets. 
Real-world  
assets are tangible assets that have traditionally been difficult to trade and  
transfer ownership, such as real estate, art, and commodities. These assets,  
however, can now be digitized and converted into tokens that can be traded on  
the blockchain, making it easier to transfer ownership and increasing  
liquidity. &lt;/…</span>

Although it is not specified in the original film, most fans assume that the Matrix takes place in the late 22nd century. The events of the film take place in a virtual environment that is meant to imitate the late 20th century, so the precise year is unknown.
