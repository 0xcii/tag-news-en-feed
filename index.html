The regulator warned that while the impact of the crypto market on the traditional financial system is still low, the risks posed by crypto to the country’s financial stability could increase sharply in the future.
 
Korean Regulator Developing Crypto Monitoring Tools
 
South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is planning to develop crypto monitoring tools and regularly inspect the risks associated with crypto assets, FSS Governor Lee Bok-hyun reportedly revealed Monday at a conference on the interconnectedness between the crypto market and the traditional financial market. He was quoted by local media as saying:

                              <span>FTX disintegrated in November last year which then led to a cascade of events that exacerbated the already struggling crypto market. 
 
The failed exchange is again hogging the headlines as FTX reports more than $415 million worth of crypto was hacked. 
 
According to recent reports, the exchange recovered more than $5 billion worth of liquid assets which would then be used to pay off creditors.
 
Some $2 million in cryptocurrency belonging to the hedge firm Alameda Research was also stolen, the company disclosed in a statement.
 
However, with this being the most recent hack that happened on the platform, will it affect the trust of creditors?

Bank-Level Cryptocurrency Regulations
 
Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country’s top financial regulator, has urged regulators globally to subject cryptocurrency exchanges to bank-level regulations, Bloomberg reported Monday.

Rise in Ethereum Value Leads to Increased Onchain Transaction Costs
 
Sending ethereum (ETH) is becoming more costly as the crypto asset’s value has risen greatly over the last 14 days. At the time of writing, ether is trading at $1,542 per unit, after reaching a high of $1,606 per unit during the same 24-hour period on Jan. 18, 2023.

However, ages-old mathematics and Elliott Wave Theory could suggest the next cycle may possibly peak much sooner than many would believe — and at price of $161,800 per coin.

                              <span>The Egyptian central bank recently claimed that its decision to devalue the local currency has been vindicated by foreign investors’ return to the country’s foreign market where they reportedly poured in $925 million in just three days. The surge in the sales of Egyptian treasury bills that mature in a year or less similarly is said to vindicate the central bank’s devaluation of the pound. 
 
Surge in Treasury Bill Sales
 
Foreign investors reportedly moved $925 million into Egypt’s foreign exchange market just days after the local currency’s exchange rate versus hard currencies sharply declined. In addition, the country’s forex market has also received inflows from the so-called local sources as well as from Egyptians working abroad.

                              <span>The new grant, in partnership with Paradigm, will bring Okcoin’s support of Bitcoin Core development to $1.5 million.
Cryptocurrency exchange Okcoin, alongside partner investment firm Paradigm, has announced a new set of funding for Bitcoin Core contribution. 
The funds will be directed into a grant for Core maintainer Marco Falke, who Okcoin has supported in the past, in 2021 and in 2020. Okcoin has also previously provided support for Lightning developer Antoine Riard in a bid to support the second-layer network’s privacy.
“Falke is one of six people in the world with the ability to approve or deny proposed changes to the code underlying the world’s biggest cryptocurrency,” the announcement explains. “As a Bitcoin Core maintainer, he reviews proposed additions to the network’s code from contributors, of which there are over 400 currently active. The grant from Okcoin and Paradigm is to provide Falke with a livable income while he devotes 40+ hours per week to Bitcoin Core development — a job without a salary, given Bitcoin’s decentralized structure.”
The announcement also highlights that many Bitcoin users may not know that the developers and maintainers of Bitcoin are technically volunteers, who, due to the nature of Bitcoin, have no centralized organization to provide funding or support for their efforts. Okcoin had previously released a survey that showed that 85% of Bitcoiners care about exchanges funding Bitcoin development. 
Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang addressed this, saying that “Paradigm believes it’s our responsibility to help fund independent Bitcoin research and development … We’re pleased to provide a grant to Marco, who continues to move the network forward with his work.”
This particular contribution brings Okcoin’s total contributions to Bitcoin development funding to $1.5 million. This respectable offering to the Bitcoin network would ideally be replicated by other firms in the industry in order to support development of the technology that allows for their existence.</span>

With very vague and non-descriptive language, the DoJ made an announcement that a press release detailing “International Crypto Enforcement Action” was to follow in the hours following the release.
 
What followed can only be described as another hilarious moment in the rarely dry atmosphere of crypto.
 
Enforcement Action… Or Something Like It 
The DoJ’s live-streamed press release took place at 17:00 UTC and leading speculation across social channels ran the gambit: could a stablecoin ban, or increased regulations, be incoming? Could a government crackdown in some regulatory fashion be impending? The announcement was, in fact, neither of th…</span>
