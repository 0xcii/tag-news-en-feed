Shiba Inu Whales Move Billions Of SHIB
 
On-chain data shows that Shiba Inu whales moved billions of SHIB in different transactions. In one transaction, 77.2 billion SHIB tokens were moved to a Coinbase wallet. Meanwhile, over 205 billion SHIB tokens were moved across different wallets, some of which were transferred to a Robinhood wallet.

A recent report from CoinShares highlighted nearly $1 billion net outflow from these funds, marking a historic departure from a 7-week inflow streak that had cumulatively amassed $12.3 billion.
 
A Closer Look At The Outflows
 
The magnitude of these outflows at roughly $942 million is particularly notable, almost doubling the previous record of $500 million witnessed towards the end of January.
 
 
Major players in the asset management space, including BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares, felt the brunt of this wave of withdrawals, according to CoinShares.

This decision follows the Exchange&#x27;s earlier notice on March 11, indicating its intention to allow the trading of Crypto ETNs in the second quarter of the year.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 25, 2024
  
  
  
Subject to approval by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the base prospectuses, the Exchange plans to commence trading of these ETNs on Tuesday, May 28, 2024. This move is aimed at ensuring maximum issuer participation on the first trading day and allowing issuers sufficient time to prepare their documentation and meet regulatory requirements.
&quot;We have decided to launch the market in Crypto ETNs on 28 May 2024 to enable the maximum number of issuers to be present in the market on the first day of trading,&quot; the notice stated. &quot;In choosing this date we have taken into consideration that we need to ensure that issuers meet the requirements for consideration detailed in the Crypto ETN factsheet and importantly, it will also enable those issuers planning on admitting securities on the launch date, time to prepare documentation to establish a Crypto ETN programme which will require a base prospectus to be approved by the FCA.&quot;
Issuers interested in listing securities on the Main Market on May 28 must submit the necessary information to the Exchange by April 15. This includes details on how the issuer and/or the ETN will meet the requirements outlined in the Crypto ETN factsheet and a draft of the base prospectus highlighting relevant disclosures.
However, issuers failing to meet the specified requirements, submit their applications after April 15, or have their base prospectus unapproved by the FCA by midday on May 22, 2024, will not be eligible to participate in the first day of trading.</span>

sounded the alarm against two dubious trading platforms, HKCEXP and EDY, today (Monday).  
In an official statement released on its website, the SFC cautioned investors  
about engaging with these platforms, citing suspicions of fraudulent  
activities.
Allegations of False Claims and Withdrawal Woes
According to the SFC, EDY is purported to be a virtual asset  
trading platform, falsely claiming affiliation with a financial institution in  
Hong Kong and a digital token system developed by another financial  
institution. However, investigations have revealed no such associations exist.  
Moreover, investors have lodged complaints stating they encountered  
difficulties withdrawing funds from the platform post deposits, indica…</span>

The conversation was sparked by a post from “Autism Capital,” a crypto influencer with significant clout in the crypto dialogue, who lamented Buterin’s reduced engagement on X, advocating for its potential to significantly uplift Ethereum’s presence.
 
Why Is The Ethereum Founder Avoiding X?
 
“Vitalik needs to get back on X. Farcaster isn’t going to win the culture war. If he wants Ethereum to shine he should engage more on this platform, not sequester himself with his chosen peers on an island.

                              <span>Despite Bitcoin&#x27;s decline, several alternative cryptocurrencies remain robust. Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness a $94 million outflow, although outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may decelerate. Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase&#x27;s premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin&#x27;s all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance. Solana&#x27;s (SOL) decentralized exchange (DEX) achieves a monthly volume of $50 billion, with revenue soaring 30-fold. OKX announces support for a new Solana token standard. Despite expectations, Layer 2 activity remains sluggish post-Dencun, according to Vitalik Buterin.</span>
