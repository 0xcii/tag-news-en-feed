JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japanese public company Metaplanet purchases additional 23.35 #Bitcoin worth $1.6 million 🚀 pic.twitter.com/TdUcX2TQjG
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 11, 2024
  
  
  
As of June 11, Metaplanet holds approximately 141 Bitcoin acquired for ¥1.45 billion at an average per-bitcoin price of ¥10,278,391 ($65,000). The firm adopted Bitcoin as its treasury reserve asset in April 2024 with an initial ¥1 billion purchase. It has made several buys since.
Metaplanet&#x27;s stock rose 10% following its latest million-dollar Bitcoin acquisition, the third such purchase in just 7 weeks. The company&#x27;s share price has increased nearly fivefold since first announcing its Bitcoin strategy in April, validating its Bitcoin pivot.
By accumulating Bitcoin, Metaplanet aims to hedge against Japan&#x27;s massive national debt burden and rapidly devaluing yen currency. The firm is closely following MicroStrategy&#x27;s influential Bitcoin corporate treasury playbook.
For Japanese investors, owning Metaplanet shares provides exposure to Bitcoin&#x27;s upside without incurring Japan&#x27;s tax on crypto unrealized gains, which can exceed 50%. Metaplanet also enables access to Bitcoin without regulatory hurdles by trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The embrace of Bitcoin by public Asia-based companies like Metaplanet further legitimizes Bitcoin as a solid treasury reserve asset. Firms across continents are now awakening to Bitcoin&#x27;s promise as an inflation hedge and store of value asset in their balance sheet.</span>
