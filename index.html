One of them is Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minnesota), who on February 22 presented a bill to restrict the Fed from issuing CBDCs to private retail consumers.
 
Emmer, one of the most prominent backers of cryptocurrencies in Congress, offered similar legislation early last year. To protect user privacy, the measure attempted to mandate that any digital currency developed by the central bank be “permissionless.” The bill failed to pass.

According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Immutable made the announcement to employees on Wednesday morning. The company had previously raised $280 million from investors in a funding round that valued the crypto gaming company at $3.5 billion in March of last year.
 
It appears that the company’s June layoff of 20 employees, or around 6% of its personnel, was insufficient to prevent financial difficulties and the necessity to preserve cash flow following the fall of the cryptocurrency market.

                              <span>World Wide Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee says cryptocurrency is “really dangerous” and “only speculative.” While claiming that crypto is for those who “want to have a kick out of gambling,” he noted that it could be useful for remittances.
 
Sir Tim Berners-Lee on Crypto
 
Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the British computer scientist who is widely credited with the invention of the World Wide Web, shared his thoughts about cryptocurrency on CNBC’s “Beyond the Valley” podcast, published last week.
 
Berners-Lee called cryptocurrency “dangerous” and likened it to gambling. Claiming that “cryptocurrency can be 100% speculative” and “not linked to anything at all,” he opined:
 

It’s only speculative. Obviously, that’s really dangerous.
 
He asserted that crypto is for “if you want to have a kick out of gambling, basically.” He also compared cryptocurrency to the dot-com bubble, noting that people were valuing various internet stocks “because of what they imagined other people will value them in the future, so in other words it wasn’t based on revenue or anything real so the bubble came.” He further stressed: “Investing in certain things, which is purely speculative, isn’t what, where I want to spend my time.”
 
 
However, Berners-Lee said cryptocurrencies could be useful for remittances. He shared:
 

Having been using it for remittances, that seems to be the most useful thing, if you transfer stuff into blockchain because you can get that immediately to your family.
 
The British computer scientist emphasized: “Just don’t keep the currency … get rid of it, put it back into USD.”

After over a year of preparation and restructuring, decentralized and privacy-enabled AI organization Federated Learning Consortium (FLC) is set to launch as a for-profit research consortium in Hong Kong, China, shifting from a previously non-profit approach. FLC is set to be led by founding keystone members – blockchain technology platform Phoenix and leading China-based consumer data and AI company APEX Technologies.
 
FLC’s vision is centered on researching, developing, and promoting cutting-edge technologies surrounding federated AI, including federated learning, blockchain-enabled AI, multi-party computation (MPC), and TEE (trusted execution environment).

On February 22nd, member of the House of Representatives Tom Emmer introduced the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Anti-Surveillance State Act to implement monetary policies that help to prevent the control of the economy and promote financial freedom for Americans. Tom Emmer stated:
 

Today, I introduced the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act to halt efforts of unelected bureaucrats in Washington, DC from stripping Americans of their right to financial privacy.

                              <span>Is the latest Ethereum rally a bull trap or the start of a fresh bull market? Here’s what the ETH-taker buy-sell ratio says about it.
 
Ethereum Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Has Fallen Below 1 Recently
 
An analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out that the recent sentiment has been bearish according to the metric. The “taker buy-sell ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the taker buy and taker sell volumes in the Ethereum futures market.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it suggests the “long” or the taker buy volume is higher than the “short” or the taker sell volume currently. Such a trend means more buyers are willing to acquire cryptocurrency at a higher price.

                              <span>Could China’s sentiment around crypto be a turning tide? A move from Tencent Cloud this week could certainly suggest so. An unexpected investment in web3-related tools will hit the market from Tencent Cloud’s team, positioning the Chinese tech firm alongside the ranks of other global tech firms to make recent strides in web3, such as Google and Amazon.
 
The tech conglomerate’s new Web3 investment will include a new suite of crypto-native partnerships, too.

Luxor Plans to Address Challenges in the Market for Ordinal Inscription Trades
 
At the time of writing, there are more than 160,000 Ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain, and the trend shows no signs of slowing.

                              <span>Kristin Smith is Executive Director of the Blockchain Association, which advocates for crypto policy in Washington D.C.—an exhausting effort that Sam Bankman-Fried was closely involved in, until he set it all on fire. Kristin tells Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott how SBF and FTX set things back, but there are still positive signs from crypto friendly voices in Congress.
