                              <span>The trial of the former CEO of defunct crypto exchange FTX Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has taken full shape with just less than a week before it commences. In preparation, the court has released the trial calendar, which shows how long the case is expected to last. 
 
A Close Look At The Calendar
 
According to the court document dated September 28, the trial is set to begin on October 4 and end on November 9. Although the first court session is set to occur on October 3, that day is solely set for Jury selection and not when the hearing will commence. 
 
Once that is done, Judge Kaplan, the judge in charge of SBF’s case, alongside the Jury, will begin hearing the Prosecution’s case against Sam Bankman-Fried on October 4. SBF’s lawyers are also expected to open their defense at some point.

Vinijtrongjit argued that the need for such tools will even become “more crucial” if and when the much-talked-about widespread adoption of Web3 becomes a reality.

                              <span>Coinbase, the renowned cryptocurrency trading platform, has announced that its Bermuda-based entity, Coinbase International Exchange, has received regulatory approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BAM) to offer perpetual futures to retail customers outside the United States. 
 
The move marks Coinbase’s entry into the rapidly growing market for perpetual futures, which have become dominant in cryptocurrency trading abroad. 
 
According to Barron’s report, this development not only positions the US-based exchange as a direct competitor to Binance, the current leader in the crypto perpetual-futures market, but also signifies the platform’s expansion strategy and commitment to providing a comprehensive range of services to its global user base.

                              <span>Rich Rines, original Core DAO contributor and former Coinbase engineer, discusses how the narrative around Bitcoin is shifting in 2023. While Bitcoin remains digital gold, new layer 2 solutions are emerging to unlock more utility and value from the huge amounts of capital stored in Bitcoin. He says these innovations can benefit Bitcoin holders while keeping Bitcoin maximalists happy by building outside the base layer. André Beganski interviewed him at Messari Mainnet 2023.</span>
