The judge labeled certain crypto assets traded on secondary markets as securities.

In 2022, the SEC presented charges against Coinbase’s former product manager Ishan Wahi, his brother Nikhil Wahi, and a close friend Sameer Ramani for securities violation for insider trading of certain crypto asset.
 
The SEC alleged that the former Coinbase employee “tipped off” his brother and friend about the exchange’s upcoming listing announcements, which he took part in coordinating. Last year, Ishan and Nikhil Wahi settled their charges…</span>

                              <span>The crypto investment space has reached a notable mark, with trading volumes hitting a high of $30 billion in trading volume last week. This surge, as reported by CoinShares, signifies a pivotal moment in accepting and integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial portfolios.
 
Coinshares also reported that the overall assets under management (AUM) are now nearing an all-time high, with current figures above $80 billion. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, particularly noted:
 

Total assets under management (AuM), after recent price rises, are now very close to the all-time high at US$82.6bn, just shy of the US$86bn peak set early November 2021.

Bitcoin Has Surged Alongside Increase In Whale Count
 
As explained by analyst Ali in a new post on X, there has been a correlation between the cryptocurrency’s price and the total number of entities carrying at least 1,000 BTC.
 
“Entity” refers to a cluster of addresses owned by the same investor, as determined by advanced heuristics done by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode.
 
 
Entities carrying more than 1,000 BTC are popularly called “whales.” At the current asset exchange rate, this lower cutoff for the cohort converts to about $66.5 million.

                              <span>Willy Woo, a respected Bitcoin on-chain analyst, is bullish on the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency. Taking to X on March 4, the analyst said BTC can soar to as high as $125,000 by the end of 2025.
 
Institutions Are Here, Bitcoin To $125,000 By End Of 2025 
This optimistic outlook hinges on increased institutional adoption, particularly from investment giants Blackrock and Fidelity. Notably, Woo suggests that even a minimal 3% allocation to Bitcoin by clients of these firms could push the price past $125,000. 
 
 
For context, the analyst highlights Blackrock’s $9.1 trillion assets under management (AUM) and Fidelity’s $4.2 trillion AUM. These figures are used with Blackrock and Fidelity’s most optimistic portfolio allocation recommendations of around 84.9% for Blackrock and 3% for Fi…</span>

                              <span>MicroStrategy Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR) has announced its plans to offer $600 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2030 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers. The offering is subject to market conditions and other factors, with the potential to increase by an additional $90 million.

These unsecured, senior obligations of MicroStrategy will bear interest payable semi-annually and mature on March 15, 2030. The company intends to grant initial purchasers an option to purchase additional notes within a 13-day period.
MicroStrategy plans to use the net proceeds from the offering to &quot;acquire additional bitcoin and for general corporate purposes.&quot; The offering will be made to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933.
As the self described &quot;world&#x27;s first Bitcoin development company&quot;, MicroStrategy is dedicated to supporting the growth and development of the Bitcoin network. The company uses its cashflows and proceeds from equity and debt financings to accumulate bitcoin, which serves as its primary treasury reserve asset.
The offering will help bolster MicroStrategy&#x27;s position in the Bitcoin market and further its mission of advancing Bitcoin adoption and innovation. However, the offering is subject to uncertainties related to market conditions and completion terms, as outlined in MicroStrategy&#x27;s recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
MicroStrategy&#x27;s stock has outperformed Bitcoin year to date in 2024, rising 94.70% at the time of writing, compared to a 58.22% rise for BTC.</span>
