Ethical Concerns Arise as Binance Lawyers Accuse SEC Chair Gensler of Past Interest
 
Legal representatives from Gibson Dunn and Latham &amp; Watkins, defending Binance after the SEC filed 13 charges against the platform, suggest that commission chair Gary Gensler expressed interest in advising Binance a few years prior.

customer cash and cryptocurrency as part of a process to window its operations

weeks after exiting the country over regulatory challenges.
In the same  
month, the cryptocurrency exchange sought permission from the bankruptcy court in Delaware to pay  
its customers their crypto holdings in line with terms agreed with customers and to avoid costly litigation.  
The exchange argued that courts have previously permitted payments such as for  
critical services before a firm’s bankruptcy plan confirmation hearing.

The Prague Pop-Up Federation will offer exclusive features to invitees, including the ability to broadcast messages on chat, use sats (satoshis) and access Sites sessions with event information. The event, only available during the conference, aims to turn it into a proving ground for Fedi Alpha, with attendees serving as test pilots.
Fedi co-founder and CEO, Obi Nwosu, expressed the importance of involving the Bitcoin community in shaping Fedi: &quot;We’re building Fedi with you ... It’s about turning BTC Prague into a proving ground, and all of the attendees into the test pilots of Fedi Alpha.&quot;
Participants can download a limited version of Fedi Alpha to join the Prague Pop-Up Federation, enabling them to receive live updates from the conference, engage in secure chats and send/receive sats to fellow attendees. The project showcases Fedi&#x27;s vision of a federated operating system that empowers individuals and communities to regain control over their money and data.

                              <span>Cardano dropped to a three-month low on Thursday, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remained largely bearish. The move comes as traders continue to worry about what the recent Binance and Coinbase lawsuits could mean for the wider market. Solana also slipped to a multi-month low.
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) plunged to a three-month low on Thursday, as traders remained nervous, following the recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits.
 
After a high of $0.3376 on Wednesday, ADA/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.3196 earlier in today’s session.
 
The drop pushed the token to its lowest level since March 15, when price was at a bottom of $0.3166.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) moved deep into oversold territory, falling to a low below 30.00.
 
The index has since rebounded, and is tracking at 34.21, which is marginally above a key level of resistance at the 33.00 mark.
 
Should this upward momentum continue, bulls will look to recapture the $0.3500 level.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
In addition to ADA, solana (SOL) sank to a multi-month low of its own during today’s session.
 
SOL/USD fell to an intraday low of $18.29 on Thursday, which comes less than a day after the price was above $20.00.
 
As a result of this latest decline, solana fell to its weakest point since March 13, when the price was under $18.00.
 
 
Overall, SOL is down by almost 9% in the last seven days, with the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) in free fall as a result.
 
Should the trend line maintain its current course, there will be a downward cross with the 25-day (blue) MA.
 
For bears who still remain despite the recent oversold status, the next target will likely be $16.00.

                              <span>The decentralized finance (DeFi) community received good news yesterday after the 2-year-long lawsuit against the DeFi protocol PoolTogether finally came to an end. PoolTogether’s co-founder, Leighton Cusack, excitedly shared the update on Twitter, saying the court has dismissed the case.
 
US federal judge Frederic Block dismissed the lawsuit filed by Joseph Kent against the DeFi Startup in October 2022. 
 
Why Judge Dismissed Lawsuit Against DeFi Startup
 
The former head of tech for Senator Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign, Joseph Kent, filed a reformed class action lawsuit against PoolTogther Inc. The plaintiff sued the firm for severe damages after depositing $12 worth of stablecoins into the protocol.

Consumer Organization (BEUC) has filed a complaint with the European Commission
