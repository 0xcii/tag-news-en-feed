Bitcoin 7-Day MA Puell Multiple Has Surged Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Puell Multiple is currently at the second highest level for the year. The “Puell Multiple” is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the daily Bitcoin miner revenue and the 365-day moving average (MA) of the same.
 
When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the miners are currently earning more than the average for the past year. On the other hand, the indicator being below the mark suggests these chain validators are making less than usual right now.

He ran on a platform promising substantial reforms: cutting spending, reducing government intervention, addressing inflation, and eliminating the central bank.
Milei&#x27;s path to victory was unexpected. In the general elections, he secured second place with 30% of the vote, trailing Sergio Massa of the Peronist establishment, who garnered 37%. Patricia Bullrich, former Minister of Security under President Macri&#x27;s administration, obtained 24%. These results forced Balotaje, or a run-off election between Massa and Milei.

                              <span>In a detailed analysis, Will Clemente, an on-chain analyst and co-founder of Reflexivity Research, has presented a thought-provoking perspective on the Bitcoin price’s potential performance in a recessionary environment. His views challenge the widely held belief that BTC, as a ‘risk-on’ asset, would suffer in economic downturns, offering a nuanced understanding of its relationship with market liquidity and economic cycles.
 
Why Bitcoin May Rise During A Prolonged Recession
 
Clemente’s argument hinges on the understanding of BTC as a hedge against monetary debasement rather than a conventional asset tied to economic performance. He explained, “Bitcoin is a hedge against monetary debasement. It goes down when liquidity declines and goes up when liquidity rises.”

                              <span>The financial underpinnings of 
Hamas reveal a nuanced strategy involving global transactions and the 
exploitation of cryptocurrency. With an estimated annual income exceeding $1 
billion, Hamas relies on physical force, ideological influence, and a diverse 
income stream located overseas. A significant portion of this income, around 
$750 million annually, comes 
from foreign sources. Cryptocurrency, particularly through crypto markets, 
emerges as a 
tool for Hamas to circumvent Western sanctions.

Role in Global Terrorism Financing
 
Widening the lens to the

                              <span>In an unprecedented analysis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has unveiled a comprehensive report detailing the involvement of banks in crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The data, which marks a significant step in understanding institutional engagement in the crypto sector, reveals that total crypto exposures reported by banks stand at approximately €9.4 billion.
 
Overall, 19 banks reported their crypto assets: 10 banks are from the Americas, 7 banks are from Europe, and 2 banks from the rest of the world. These 19 banks make up a relatively small part of the wider sample of 182 banks considered in the Basel III monitoring exercise, accounting for 17.1% of total risk-weighted assets (RWA) and 20.9% of the overall leverage ratio exposure measure (LREM), with …</span>

The meme coin has also not performed at the same level as some other altcoins, hence the widespread belief that it will see a delayed but explosive move. One of the analysts who envision a big blowout for the meme coin is Alan Santana who took to TradingView to share his bullish sentiment for the DOGE price.
