With multiple measures already put in place still not efficiently reducing the number of bots on the platform, Musk has moved on to a new strategy that involves paying to use X. But does Dogecoin fit into the payment plans?
 
Elon Musk Wants X Users To Pay To Play
 
In an interesting turn of events, Elon Musk is considering putting the entire X site behind a paywall. The billionaire revealed this while talking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to Musk, he is considering this option as a way to reduce the bot activity on the social media platform.

XRP, dogecoin, litecoin, and ethereum classic are among the coins removed from the Greenlist. The regulator also proposed new crypto guidance that “heightens risk assessment standards for coin-listing policies and tailors enhanced requirements for retail consumer-facing businesses.”

On Monday, New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) Superintendent Adrienne A.

Revealed in a post on X Tuesday, Rodarmor specifically proposed deprioritizing the canonical numbering system that assigns unique and coveted numbers to inscriptions created on the Bitcoin network. 
Since the protocol&#x27;s inception, each digital artifact created using Ordinals has been assigned a unique inscription number. These numbers, akin to serial numbers, have become an essential part of the digital art&#x27;s identity. 
Lower numbered inscriptions have been historically perceived as more valuable, driving collectors to seek these coveted positions within the numbering hierarchy. …</span>

                              <span>Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, has witnessed a burgeoning interest in digital currencies. According to a report, Nigeria’s recent spike in crypto usage can be attributed to economic conditions and the nation’s youth-driven technological resurgence.
 
The implications of this growing trend can’t be understated, especially considering Nigeria’s position as Africa’s largest economy. Nigerians are seeking viable alternatives for their financial activities, with the naira experiencing significant devaluation and inflation rates soaring.
 
 
Crypto Transactions Surge Amid Naira Devaluation
 
According to a New York-based blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis report, Nigeria’s cryptocurrency transactions swelled 9% year-over-year, reaching $56.7 billion between July 2022 and June 2023.

                              <span>According to a recent court filing, interim judicial managers for the troubled crypto lender Hodlnaut oppose a takeover by the crypto firm OPNX, which is linked to the now-defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and its founders.
 
OPNX Takeover Faces Resistance from Hodlnaut’s Judicial Management
 
On September 19, 2023, Bloomberg’s Suvashree Ghosh reported on a recent court filing stating that Hodlnaut’s judicial managers oppose a OPNX takeover deal. Hodlnaut, a crypto lender, halted withdrawals in August 2023, citing deteriorating market conditions. A week later, Hodlnaut sought judicial management to rehabilitate the company.
 
Court filings showed Hodlnaut faced a shortfall of about $193 million. A significant portion of the company’s losses came from the decline of Terra. OPNX, a crypto-centric exchange allowing users to trade claims of bankrupt crypto firms, was founded by Three Arrows Capital‘s Kyle Davies and Su Zhu. The Bloomberg report mentioned that estate administrators allege the judicial managers deem a $30 million payment in FLEX tokens as “illiquid.”
 
 
The report indicates that 60% of Hodlnaut’s creditors oppose the deal, but neither the firm’s interim judicial managers nor OPNX offered comments. This news comes after Zhu and Davies were barred from participating in regulated financial activities in Singapore for nine years. Additionally, on August 16, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) fined OPNX.
