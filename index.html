                              <span>The Shiba Inu community is on a roll with burning SHIB as the initiative continues to see spike after spike. The burn rate has seen a significant increase once again in the last 24 hours as millions of tokens were sent to the burn address.
 
SHIB Burn Rate Spike 420%
 
According to data from the Shibburn website, the SHIB burn rate saw another 421% increase in the last 24 hours. This spike comes as Shiba Inu community members change from their pattern from the previous day, which saw only a little over 1 million tokens burned.
 
 
This time around, there have been more than 5.3 million tokens incinerated, which brought about the 421% spike reported by the website. Interestingly, the total burns came from less than 10 addresses. As the burn tracking website shows, there have been only six b…</span>

                              <span>In a significant development, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) convened with applicants seeking approval for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) today, according to Eleanor Terrett and Charles Gasparino of FOX Business. 



Terrett revealed sources who attended the meeting said the SEC was &quot;making sure everyone is doing cash creates,&quot; and &quot;asked issuers to remove all hints of in-kind redemptions from their filings.&quot; This meeting assumes paramount importance amid the ongoing discussions and evaluations regarding the approval of such ETFs.
Terrett&#x27;s post hinted at the collaborative nature of the meeting, suggesting efforts to bring all stakeholders onto the same page regarding the nuances, prerequisites, and potential implications associated with their spot Bitcoin ETF applications. While details about all the specifics remain undisclosed, the meeting likely focused on addressing concerns, clarifying regulatory expectations, and streamlining the evaluation process for these ETF applications.
The SEC&#x27;s engagement with applicants reflects a commitment to comprehensively assess the viability and regulatory compliance of the proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs. The outcome of this meeting could significantly influence the trajectory of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, potentially paving the way for a more structured framework for institutional participation in this burgeoning industry. 
As market participants await further developments, this meeting stands as a crucial milestone in the potential approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Yesterday, FOX Business reported that BlackRock made receiving an approval for their spot Bitcoin ETF a &quot;key corporate priority,&quot; and that the ETFs will have a SEC decision by January 10.</span>

                              <span>Recently, the seasoned financial analyst and trader Peter Brandt has been increasingly expressive about crypto assets, with a particular focus on bitcoin and ethereum. On Dec. 21, 2023, Brandt reaffirmed his stance regarding the anticipated Bitcoin reward halving set for April 2024. He contends that the halving is overly sensationalized and will only exert a temporary impact on bitcoin’s price.
 
Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Dismisses Bitcoin Halving Buzz as Exaggerated Frenzy
 

 
Back at the end of July 2023, Peter Brandt had already conveyed his viewpoint, dismissing the forthcoming bitcoin halving as an inconsequential “non-event.” He reiterated this perspective on Thursday, taking to X (previously known as Twitter) to issue a statement about the halving event.

We’re less than 30,000 blocks out from the halvening and the stakes couldn’t be higher. For many Bitcoin mining operators, this will make or break the bets made during this Bitcoin epoch. Did I grow too fast? Can I handle a catastrophic drop in hashprice? Will my operations get rekt by my current energy contract? Bitcoin itself remains indifferent. The halvening is inevitable, encoded by Satoshi at Bitcoin’s genesis and enforced by nodes across the world. The blocks will continue to flow and there will be b…</span>
