Victoria VR Sets to Be First Crypto-Related App to Launch on Vision Pro
 
The upcoming Victoria VR game is set to become the first crypto-related application for Apple’s latest product offering, the Vision Pro. Despite Apple’s reluctance to label the Vision Pro as a VR headset, for all intents and purposes it is a VR headset with augmented reality-like features.

Ripple Is Still Committed To Payments
 
Schwartz expressed his bewilderment over the underutilization of digital assets in the payment sector. “One of the things that perplexes me the most about this space is that people are not using digital assets for payments, even though they work for payments better than they ever have,” he stated.

Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Has Registered A Surge Of More Than 7%
 
On the Bitcoin blockchain, there is an in-built special feature called the “mining difficulty.” Basically, why this feature exists is to ensure that the block rewards on the network continue to be given out near a constant rate.
 
The block rewards refer to the BTC that miners receive when they successfully add blocks to the network. These rewards are the only way in existence to mint more of the cryptocurrency. As such, the rate at which miners churn out blocks is equal to the production rate of the asset.
