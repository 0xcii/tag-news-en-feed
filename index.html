                              <span>On Thursday, March 9, U.S. President Biden revealed his budget proposal for 2024. Under the Biden Budget, the U.S. Treasury Department is looking to introduce a 30% excise tax on crypto mining operations. 
 
According to a section in the Treasury department’s 2024 revenue proposals document, the Biden administration advances the motion that “Any firm using computing resources, whether owned by the firm or leased from others, to mine digital assets would be subject to an excise tax equal to 30 percent of the costs of electricity used in digital asset mining.”
 
For full implementation of this tax fee, all crypto mining firms will be required to submit reports detailing their electricity consumption amount and its value. Therefore, this proposal will also cover crypto-mining firms which acqu…</span>

Further, it is the first regulatory lawsuit that claims Ether to be a security. The labeling of Ether as a security was based on the Martin Act, a 102-year-old anti-fraud law, as the cryptocurrency&#x27;s market value depends on the actions of others, including its Co-Founder, Vitalik Buterin.

One of the most significant developments in the Shiba Inu ecosystem is the Shiba Inu Burn initiative, whose main objective is to limit supply of the coins in circulation, create scarcity, and force an increase in the token’s price.
 
Billions of SHIB tokens have just been transferred to dead wallets across 48 transactions on Thursday. As a result, the 24-hour burn rate of the crypto has skyrocketed to the level of almost 30,000%.
