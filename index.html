Staking In The US
 
Staking crypto has become the norm, especially as many blockchains are now relying on the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The US is home to the biggest crypto stakers in the world, and Coinbase is at the forefront of staking services in the country.

                              <span>Two weeks into July and bitcoin has risen to a fourteen-month high, as cryptocurrency markets reacted to the Ripple Labs’ ruling. XRP was partially ruled to not be a security by U.S. judge Analisa Torres, after a lawsuit from the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, what does this mean for price action for the remainder of the month? 
 
Current Market Status
 
Prior to Thursday, cryptocurrency markets mostly consolidated to start the month, as traders digested various data points from the United States.
 
Firstly, non-farm payrolls fell below expectations, coming in at 205,000, then inflation also slipped, dropping to a two-year low of 3.0%.
 
Despite this, traders still struggled to define market sentiment, with BTC unable to break out of a ceiling at $31,000, until this week.
 

 
July Outlook
 
Bitcoin (BTC) surged to an intraday peak of $31,862 on Thursday, which was its strongest level since May 2022.
 
The move came following a breakout of a resistance level at $31,400, however, bulls have so far been unable to sustain this.
 
As of writing this, BTC is trading at $30,342.71, after briefly falling below $30,000 during Saturday’s session.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the price has since stabilized, as the relative strength index (RSI) of 14 weeks, fell to a floor at 61.00.
 
Should this floor hold, bitcoin bulls will likely continue to target a breakout above the next key ceiling, which lay at $32,400.

                              <span>Shiba inu was one of Saturday’s biggest movers, as the meme coin rose by as much as 7% to start the weekend. The global crypto market cap was mostly lower, falling by over 2% as traders began to secure recent gains. Despite this, dogecoin also rose, hitting a two-month high in today’s session.
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB) rose by as much as 7% to start the weekend, despite the wider cryptocurrency market mostly moving lower.
 
SHIB/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $0.000008484 on Saturday, a day after trading at a low of $0.000007705.
 
As a result of today’s high, the meme coin rose to its strongest point since June 5, when the price was trading at $0.00000867.
 
 
The move took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at the 62.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing this, the index is now at 64.00, with an upcoming resistance point of 68.00 a possible destination for bulls.
 
There is a good chance that SHIB will be trading at $0.00000900, in the event the bulls reach their target.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Another notable gainer to start the weekend was dogecoin (DOGE), which also cemented a multi-month high.
 
Following a low of $0.0672 on Friday, DOGE/USD jumped 5% higher on Saturday, hitting a peak of $0.07471 in the process.
 
This resulted in the meme coin trading at its highest level since May 8, which is the last time price was above $0.0770.
 
 
Earlier gains have somewhat faded, as traders leave earlier positions, as a result of the RSI colliding with a ceiling at 66.00.
 
The meme coin is now trading at $0.07351, however overall sentiment for the weekend could remain bullish, should it move past the 66.00 point.

In politics, individuals are often grouped into “left” and “right” wings, but the complexities go well beyond this simple dichotomy. To gain a deeper understanding of people’s beliefs and values, and ultimately how these will inform their outlook on Bitcoin, it is crucial to consider their social views as well. This is where a political compass comes into play, serving as a valuable tool for analysis.
What Is A Political Compass?
The political compass is a graphical representation of political ideologies that helps categorize individuals or groups based on their views on two main axes: economic policy (left-right) and social policy (authoritarian-libertarian). It provides a more nuanced understan…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin plunged from a recent fourteen-month high to start the weekend, as traders appeared to have begun securing yesterday’s gains. The decline saw the price fall below $30,000, days after almost moving above $32,000. Ethereum also slipped, however remained above $1,900.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $30,000 to start the weekend, as traders began to take profits, following recent highs.
 
After peaking at $31,354.48 on Saturday, BTC/USD plunged to an intraday low of $29,966.39 earlier today.
 
This sees bitcoin retreat from a high of $31,862, which was the strongest level for the cryptocurrency since last May.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the decline was somewhat inevitable, due to the relative strength (RSI) moving into overbought territory.
 
The index rose to a peak of 65.55 on Thursday, before falling to a current reading of 54.17 earlier today.
 
Since this drop, price strength has since stabilized, with BTC now trading at $30,347.59.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also moved lower on Saturday, however traders were able to reject a drop below the $1,900 level.
 
ETH/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,901.36 earlier in the day, less than 24-hours after trading at a top of $2,005.96.
 
Since hitting Friday’s three-month high, bulls have opted to abandon previous positions heading into the weekend.
 
 
The world’s second largest cryptocurrency has since rebounded, bouncing away from a floor at $1,900, and now trades at $1,943.27.
 
This comes as the RSI held firm at a support point around the 55.00 zone, going on to climb to a current reading of 56.79.
 
Overall, the next target could be around the 61.00 mark, and if successfully hit, ETH will likely be back over $2,000.

However, an unfortunate oversight occurred when Adams mistakenly failed to disclose a certain aspect of his involvement with Bitcoin, a misstep that stemmed from his belief that it did not qualify as a security, according to his team.
 
 
Renowned for his outspoken support of Bitcoin, Adams, who previously served as a police officer, wholeheartedly advocates for the widespread adoption of the cryptocurrency. 
 
In a bold move, he even opted to receive a portion of his salaries in Bitcoin, favoring the decentralized digital currency over traditional fiat currencies.

                              <span>Bitcache, a crypto startup backed by Kim Dotcom, has been liquidated, reportedly over unpaid legal fees. Phil Creagh, an Auckland lawyer who acted as Bitcache’s director until Sept. 2020, is reported to have applied for the startup’s liquidation on May 24. 
 
Bitcache’s Unpaid Legal Fees
 
A New Zealand-based crypto startup previously promoted by prominent crypto advocate and entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, has been reportedly liquidated over unpaid legal fees. According to a report by Newsroom, owners of the startup known as Bitcache have not contested the decision to liquidate.
 
The liquidation of the startup, which Kim Dotcom lauded as a platform that would revolutionize the way online content creators get paid, came more than six years after it was launched. Phil Creagh, an Auckland lawyer who acted as Bitcache’s director until Sept. 2020, is reported to have applied for the startup’s liquidation on May 24.
 
 

Commenting on the decision to liquidate Bitcache before it achieved any of its objectives, Creagh said:
 

It’s pretty straightforward, there are fees owed and not paid. The company has not taken any steps so far to avoid being placed in liquidation. We’ll put it in liquidation and see what, if anything, can be recovered.
 
The lawyer added that his firm Anderson Creagh Lai stopped representing the Kim Dotcom-backed startup some time ago.
 
According to the Newsroom report, Bitcache initially hit a major obstacle in early 2017 when the platform’s planned launch was interrupted by what Dotcom referred to as a “hiccup.” Since then, attempts to launch the platform have all failed. The report added that Bitcache, which reportedly last filed a return to the Companies Office in 2021, is now likely to be removed from the Companies Register.
