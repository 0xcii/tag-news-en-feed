Bitcoin Ends 2023 With Record-Breaking 731K Transactions
 
The year 2023 saw a series of benchmarks surpassed in Bitcoin’s network and onchain activities as both the mining difficulty and hashrate soared to unprecedented levels, alongside a daily increase in transaction confirmations. On the cusp of the new year, miners cemented a record with 731,351 transactions verified on Dec. 31, 2023, largely propelled by Ordinal inscriptions.

                              <span>While the investor community currently only has its eyes on the imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), another massively bullish event is currently fading into the background: the Bitcoin halving. In just 111 days, on April 22, 2024, the next BTC Halving will take place and reduce the quantity of BTC emitted from 6.25 to 3.125.
 
Renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital has shed light on the potential market dynamics leading up to and following this pivotal event. According to him, the journey towards the halving unfolds in five distinct phases, each with its implications for investors and the market at large.

Remarkably, Nerayoff repeatedly hinted in his posts on X that a lot is currently happening in the background. In his most recent series of statements, Nerayoff has escalated his allegations against the Ethereum co-founders once again.

Bitcoin
 
Jan. 1, 2024, saw bitcoin (BTC) with a modest 24-hour trading range and a market capitalization holding strong at $834 billion. The day’s trade volume has been low, typical of New Year’s Day, signaling a cautious sentiment in the market and people enjoying their holidays.

                              <span>In Izhevsk, Russia, a 23-year-old bitcoin miner was forcefully abducted from his residence as kidnappers demanded a ransom of 15 million rubles ($166,000). 
 
23-Year-Old Russian Bitcoin Miner Kidnapped for Ransom
 
On Dec. 25, in a rapid sequence of events, it was reported that the crypto miner was kidnapped and subjected to coercion. The ordeal began when he was abruptly seized from his dwelling and shoved into a Niva car, a model noted for its durability on Russian terrain. Ren TV disclosed that the kidnappers, including one acquainted with the victim, warned of grave repercussions unless the 15 million rubles ($166,000) ransom was promptly delivered.
 
The captors swiftly relayed their ransom demands via the Telegram messaging app, reaching out directly to the victim’s brother. They leveraged threats of fabricated criminal charges to hasten the payment, stating their intent to frame the victim as a drug smuggler by planting narcotics on him and then alerting the police.
 
The culprits, identified as individuals with a history of robbery and extortion, are currently facing severe legal consequences. The gravity of the charges mirrors the Russian judiciary’s approach to this type of abduction scenario. The report indicates that the perpetrators could be sentenced to as much as 12 years of incarceration for their actions.
 
 
Regrettably, since 2014, over 100 physical assaults have targeted crypto holders. Initially, these incidents were sparse, but as the value of crypto assets soared, so did the frequency of violent acts against their owners. These attacks encompass methods like kidnappings, assaults, and home invasions. In Nov. 2023, Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, commonly referred to as CZ, revealed that criminals had kidnapped a Binance client, coercing them to drain their crypto wallets.

                              <span>Pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has weighed in on what could be the reason behind the US government dropping six charges against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). The politician suggested that there could be other motivations for this decision besides the reason that the prosecutors gave.  
 
Corruption Could Be Reason Behind Dropped Charges
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Kennedy hinted that the corruption in the system was the reason why the US prosecutors opted against a second trial for SBF. According to him, this corruption is an even bigger issue than the fraud the FTX founder committed, as this is something that has become “normalized.”

That explains why SHIB retained its position and outperformed other major tokens like ETH and XRP in this crypto exchange’s year-end report.
 
Shiba Inu Was The Second-Most Traded Coin On WazirX
 
Indian-based crypto exchange WazirX noted in its year-end report that SHIB was the second-most traded token on its exchange. SHIB outranked other major tokens, like the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, in the process. The only crypto token that outperformed the meme coin on the exchange was Bitcoin. 
 
 
WazirX also highlighted the “affinity” that its users have become known to have for the meme coin. Notably, SHIB ranked third in the most tra…</span>

Non-Custodial Mobile Wallets vs Hardware Wallets
 
Traina, a serial entrepreneur and former U.S. Ambassador to Austria, said the transformation, which he sees as being inevitable, is “definitely going to lower the entry barriers to Web3 and make it more user-friendly for everyone.” According to Traina, it was this vision for an all-encompassing Web3 wallet which motivated him to venture into the blockchain and crypto world.

In recent weeks and months, several shockingly false rumors have persisted, painting a false picture of the future with a spot ETF.
 
Busting Myths: A Look At The Most Shocking Rumors
 
Milne emphasized the stringent legal and operational frameworks governing spot ETFs. With this, he addressed the common myth that spot ETF could water down the 21 million supply of BTC by injecting “paper Bitcoin”.
