                              <span>In an advisory to his wide range of followers, Robert Kiyosaki, financial educator, and acclaimed author, has urged investors to hold on as Bitcoin prepares for what he terms as a trip into the “Banana Zone.” This phrase refers to a sharp and sudden increase in the price of Bitcoin, which Kiyosaki thinks is going to happen soon despite the market’s recent instability.
 
The banana’s shape serves as the basis for the simile, which represents the steep upward curve shown in price charts. Additionally, it is thought to be a period of high risk and great profit, therefore investors and traders should exercise extra caution and a strategic approach.

JUST IN: 🇺🇸 US Government sends 3,940 #Bitcoin worth $241 million to Coinbase 👀 pic.twitter.com/m14HpdeJ0s
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 26, 2024
  
  
  
The transferred Bitcoin was originally confiscated from convicted drug trafficker Banmeet Singh earlier in 2024. Singh was arrested in London in 2019 on distribution charges and extradited to the US in 2023. 
As part of his conviction, Singh forfeited over 8,100 Bitcoin, worth around $150 million at the time, to US authorities. 
While the recent transfer of nearly 4,000 Bitcoin is substantial, it represents just a fraction of the government&#x27;s total Bitcoin holdings. Data shows the US government currently possesses around 214,000 Bitcoin worth over $13 billion - making it the largest national holder of Bitcoin globally.
Much of the government&#x27;s Bitcoin comes from seizures related to the shuttered dark web marketplace Silk Road. The infamous Bitfinex hack of 2016 also contributed to the stash.
The transfer to Coinbase signals the government may be looking to sell some of its long-dormant Bitcoin reserves. This adds to fears of price impacts similar to the recent German government sell-off.
However, the amount moved so far is relatively minor compared to daily Bitcoin trading volumes. The US government still holds the vast majority of its seized Bitcoin, now worth billions more due to Bitcoin&#x27;s meteoric price rise.</span>

New Legislation to Regulate Virtual Asset Services
Loretta Joseph, a VFSC policy consultant and speaker at the  
conference, stated that the bill had been ready for several years but faced  
delays due to multiple cabinet changes. The bill, first introduced in 2020,  
will establish licensing and registration requirements for virtual asset

                              <span>An anonymous donor within the Bitcoin community has contributed 8 BTC, valued at approximately $500,000, to assist with the travel expenses of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, as reported by Bitcoinist yesterday. This financial support facilitated Assange’s return journey via chartered flight, an option necessitated by his prohibition from commercial airline travel.
 
According to Stella Assange, his wife, the Australian government coordinated the logistics of this costly travel, which amounted to $520,000—a debt now owed by Assange. The source of this substantial BTC donation has ignited a flurry of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and observers alike.

Litecoin Whale Has Just Made A Large Outflow From Binance
 
According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a massive transfer has been spotted on the Litecoin blockchain during the past day.
 
 
The transaction saw the movement of 286,482 LTC across the network, worth almost $20.6 million when the move went through. Given this large scale, it’s likely that a whale entity was behind it.
 
Whales are considered influential beings on the blockchain due to their large holdings, so their transactions can be worth keeping an eye on as they may end up causing fluctuations in the asset’s price.
