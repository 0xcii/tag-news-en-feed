                              <span>Shiba inu extended recent gains into the weekend, as the meme coin rose to its highest point in four months. Today’s surge saw prices climb by as much as 13%, and comes despite cryptocurrency markets mostly consolidating. Dogecoin also moved higher, breaking out of a recent ceiling in the process.
 
Shiba inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was one of the biggest movers in the market for a second consecutive session, with prices rising by as much as 13% higher today.
 
SHIB/USD rose to a high of$0.00001457 on Saturday, which was its strongest point since October 29.
 
The move comes following a low of $0.00001232 on Friday, and as bulls led a breakout of a price ceiling at $0.00001290.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the surge also led to a breakout of the relative strength index (RSI), which hit a 12-day high.
 
The index moved beyond a ceiling at 74.00 earlier in the day, and is currently tracking at a reading of 79.15.
 
This is close to a ceiling at 80.00, and has resulted in earlier bulls beginning to abandon previous positions.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) also surged in Saturday’s session, with prices breaking out of a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $0.09107 on Friday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.09489 to start the weekend.
 
As a result of this move, the meme coin once again moved above a ceiling at $0.0935 earlier in the day.
 
 
However, as the session progressed, momentum has since dropped, and this comes as the RSI collided with a hurdle.
 
The index ran into resistance at the 63.00 mark, causing bulls to retreat, in fear of a price reversal.
 
As of writing, price strength is now at 61.92, with DOGE trading at $0.09383.

                              <span>Ethereum continued to trade close to a key resistance level of $1,700 on Saturday, following Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls (NFP) report. Yesterday’s report showed that 517,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy in January, better than the 185,000 many were expecting. Bitcoin mostly consolidated however, as traders moved to take recent profits.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved lower to start the weekend, as traders continued to secure gains following a recent climb to a six-month high.
 
Following a high of $23,678.10 on Friday, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $23,279.96 earlier in Saturday’s session.
 
Today’s decline sees bitcoin fall for a third straight day, and comes following Thursday’s high of $24,262, which was BTC’s highest point since early-August last year.

Bitcoin Derivatives Volume Shows Steep Decline In 2022
 
Bitcoin witnessed an extended bearish trend in 2022, resulting in a 60% drop in its price and a steep decline in bitcoin futures and options volumes. The collapse of FTX last November further diminished the market sentiments, and there was a significant withdrawal from the derivatives market, accompanied by long liquidations and a strong bearish bias.

These recent transactions came after the Voyager altcoin transfers which included over 270 billion Shiba Inu coins worth over $3 million. This is especially discomforting for investors as this could set a negative mood in the next couple of weeks.
