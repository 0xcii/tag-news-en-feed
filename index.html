Focus On Optimism And Manta: What‚Äôs Going On?
 
Taking to X on December 20, Kiepuszewski¬†observed that some layer-2 solutions, such as Manta and Optimism, rely on sequencers to post data to Ethereum. However, without fraud-proofs, there is no way to verify that the data published by the Sequencer on the Ethereum mainnet is accurate or complete.¬†
 
In the co-founder‚Äôs view, whenever a sequencer posts the batch of transactions on the main net, there is no layer-1 state or event change. Per Kiepuszewski ‚Äòs assessment, this is ‚Ä¶</span>
