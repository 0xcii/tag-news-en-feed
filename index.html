                              <span>The financial underpinnings of 
Hamas reveal a nuanced strategy involving global transactions and the 
exploitation of cryptocurrency. With an estimated annual income exceeding $1 
billion, Hamas relies on physical force, ideological influence, and a diverse 
income stream located overseas. A significant portion of this income, around 
$750 million annually, comes 
from foreign sources. Cryptocurrency, particularly through crypto markets, 
emerges as a 
tool for Hamas to circumvent Western sanctions. 
 
Cryptocurrency&#x27;s 
Role in Global Terrorism Financing
 
Widening the lens to the 
broader landscape of cryptocurrency&#x27;s role in terrorist financing, the

                              <span>In an unprecedented analysis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has unveiled a comprehensive report detailing the involvement of banks in crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The data, which marks a significant step in understanding institutional engagement in the crypto sector, reveals that total crypto exposures reported by banks stand at approximately €9.4 billion.
 
Overall, 19 banks reported their crypto assets: 10 banks are from the Americas, 7 banks are from Europe, and 2 banks from the rest of the world. These 19 banks make up a relatively small part of the wider sample of 182 banks considered in the Basel III monitoring exercise, accounting for 17.1% of total risk-weighted assets (RWA) and 20.9% of the overall leverage ratio exposure measure (LREM), with …</span>
