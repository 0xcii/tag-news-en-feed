Thus, Coinbase was forced to act by going to court to avert possible damage to the industry.
The information was

Fighting Inflation With Dollarization
 
Argentina should consider dollarizing its economy because this “protects ordinary people’s purchasing power” from corrupt politicians and “often subservient—or simply incompetent—central bankers,” authors of the latest Cato Institute blog post.
