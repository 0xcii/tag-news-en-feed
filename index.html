                              <span>With hierarchical channels, Lightning may overcome its scalability limitations by enabling quick and flexible off-chain resizing of channels.
Developers are exploring the use of hierarchical channels to help speed up and make the Lightning Network (LN) more scalable. Hierarchical channels allow for flexible off-chain resizing of channels, enabling quick and cheap resizing, without on-chain transactions which add delays and costs. In contrast, resizing channels on-chain can cause delays of several months and increases fees. The current proposals for resizing channels off-chain involve creating a channel factory or CoinPool and exchanging capacity between channels within the same factory or pool.

The projects Spiral has launched have released new updates and features for various products, including Lightning Development Kit (LDK), Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK), Bitcoin Design Community and Bitcoin Product Community. 
The update described how the Lightning Development Kit&#x27;s LDK Node implementation aims to simplify the full suite of LDK APIs, allowing for an easier payment experience for users.

Ethereum Locked On Beacon Chain Is Carrying A Large Amount Of Loss
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Beacon Chain was carrying a peak unrealized loss of $16 billion back during the LUNA crash. The “Beacon Chain” was the name of the blockchain that launched back in December 2020 with the aim of testing an ETH proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.
 
The Beacon Chain was merged with the mainnet back in September of last year, in an event known as the Merge. This means that the entire ETH network now runs on PoS.
