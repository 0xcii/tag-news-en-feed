                              <span>For a while now, 3Commas users have been posting on social media about a possible breach that led to their API keys being leaked. This resulted in unauthorized and unusual trading patterns on users’ exchange accounts, in most cases, in a bid to pump and dump coins. 3Commas had so far denied all of the rumors saying there was no breach but with irrefutable evidence now staring them in the face, the crypto trading platform has taken responsibility for the first time.
 
How It Started
 
Popular on-chain sleuth ZachXBT took to his Twitter account to share some damning evidence that had been shared with him. In the screenshots shared with his more than 340,000 followers, someone claimed to have had access to more than 100,000 API keys leaked from 3Commas, which he eventually shared with Zach.

Around 55% Of Total Bitcoin Supply Has Been Underwater Recently
 
As per CryptoQuant’s year-end dashboard release, this metric reached a value of 60% during previous bottoms. The “supply in loss” is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that’s currently carrying some loss.
 
The metric works by looking at the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous value for any coin was greater than the latest BTC price, then that particular coin is carrying some loss at the moment, and the indicator accounts for it.

Pro-Bitcoin politician Sitiveni Rabuka recently took office as the new Prime Minister of the Pacific Islands of Fiji. Now, it seems the new PM is actively considering the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender there.
While Rabuka himself hasn’t been very public about his opinions on Bitcoin thus far, Lord Fusitu&#x27;a, a noble and former member of parliament of neighboring nation Tonga, has reportedly confirmed that the Fijian politician is a bitcoin bull.
&quot;The new PM is definitely pro-Bitcoin,&quot; Lord Fusitu&#x27;a assured Cointelegraph.
Lord Fusitu&#x27;a also shared the news on Twitter.

This is an opinion editorial by Dillon Healy, a member of the institutional partnerships team at Bitcoin Magazine and The Bitcoin Conference.
A topic that has received increased attention lately is the concern around Bitcoin’s future “security budget.”
This mainly stems from the worry that miner revenue will not be enough to offer adequate security in the future, post block subsidy. Bitcoin miners play a crucial part in securing the network by proposing blocks of transactions which nodes then verify, accept and update to the Bitcoin ledger. Competing against other miners to propose this new block to the chain, miners use intense computing power to com…</span>

The decision to delay the listing of the coin was prompted by what the team terms “current market conditions.”
 
Scheduled Token Unlocking Postponed
 
Nearly eight months after becoming the first country in Africa to adopt bitcoin, the Central African Republic (CAR) recently said it will not proceed with the listing of its “Sango” crypto token as planned. In a statement reportedly posted in a sango coin Telegram group, the team promoting the token claimed that “current market conditions” had necessitated this decision.

                              <span>North Korean hackers are taking it a notch higher by pretending to be venture capitalists to steal from cryptocurrency startups.
 
BlueNoroff, the name given by cybersecurity experts to a crew associated with the North Korean government-funded hacking operation Lazarus Group, has expanded its target list to include venture capital firms, cryptocurrency startups, and banks, a report by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab disclosed.
 
BlueNoroff stole millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies by building more than 70 phony domains and mimicking financial firms and venture capital businesses, as revealed by Kaspersky on Tuesday.
 
BlueNoroff is experimenting with new file types and delivery techniques for its virus, according to Kaspersky’s report. The North Korean hacker’s cybercrime activities i…</span>

                              <span>In a new article for Forbes, legal expert Roslyn Layton is criticizing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its questionable enforcement policy against the crypto industry and Ripple in particular. Meanwhile, frustration with the SEC and lawmakers is growing in the U.S. crypto industry.
 
Despite the fact that various industry leaders have called for clear laws and guidance for regulated progress, the agency led by Gary Gensler refuses to act. Instead, Gensler has repeatedly emphasized recently that the present regulatory framework is sufficient, and that the SEC will continue to rely on its regulatory approach through enforcement.
 
As Layton denounces, this is a policy driven by political interests. “Regulators sometimes use headline grabbing to send political messages t…</span>

The former FTX CEO is now in the comfort of home with his parents and away from that damp and rodent-infested cell in the Bahamas, where his once mighty crypto exchange empire was headquartered.
 
Sam Bankman-Fried is under house arrest. As many would already know, this was made possible by a $250 million bail his mom and dad put up just so they could prevent him from staying in another prison cell, and attend to him, like fixing him breakfast, maybe do his laundry, things parents do to their beloved child.
 
Now that he’s home, that doesn’t mean people can just drop by anytime for coffee or chat. The road leading up to his parents house has been closed down from the public.
