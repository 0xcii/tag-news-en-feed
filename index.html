                              <span>The total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (defi) has fallen below the $40 billion mark for the first time since the first week of Feb. 2021. On Dec. 17, 2022, the TVL in defi is roughly $39.53 billion after dropping more than 4% in value during the past 24 hours.
 
Value Locked in Defi Drops Below $40 Billion
 
The value locked in defi protocols has dropped below the $40 billion region for the first time in 675 days, or since the first week of Feb. 2021. At that period in time, it was the first time the TVL in defi reached the $40 billion mark after climbing from the $1 billion zone a year prior in Feb. 2020.
 

 
With the aggregate locked in defi today at $39.53 billion, statistics show that Makerdao commands the largest TVL this weekend and dominates by 14.91%. Makerdao’s TVL is around $5.89 billion and during the last week, it has shed 6.88% in value. In terms of value-locked data, Makerdao’s TVL is followed by Lido, Curve, Aave, and Uniswap respectively.
 
Most of the value locked today is held on Ethereum as there’s $23.06 billion in value locked in ETH-based defi apps, which represents 58.33% of the aggregate locked. Ethereum’s TVL is followed by Tron, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Fantome, Cronos, and Solana.
 
 
The entire lot of smart contract protocol tokens today has lost 7.5% in value against the U.S. dollar, equating to a total of $240 billion. Out of the top ten smart contract protocol tokens, BNB saw the largest weekly decline as it has lost 17.6% during the past seven days. Ethereum Classic (ETC) suffered a loss of 16.3% during the past week and Tron suffered the least with a 2.2% loss over the last seven days.

While reports disclosed that Gemini’s leak was approximately “5,701,649 lines of information pertaining to Gemini customers,” Gemini did not disclose how many customers were affected by the breach. Moreover, according to Bleeping Computer’s cybersecurity author, Ionut Ilascu, data from Gemini’s customer info leak has been advertised for sale on hacker forums as early as Sept. 2022.

Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) moved to a fresh all-time low to start the weekend, as prices dropped for a third straight session.
 
Following a high of $0.3011 on Friday, ADA/USD moved to a low of $0.2603 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw the token plunge by nearly 13% earlier in the day, hitting a new all-time low in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the drop comes as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
This signals a shift in price momentum, and comes as the relative strength index (RSI) fell deeper into oversold territory.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 24.13, which is its weakest point since October 21.
 
 
Binance Coin (BNB)
 
Binance coin (BNB) was another notable token to fall today, with prices dropping for a seventh straight session.
 
Recent declines have come as financial firm Mazars halted its audit of Binance’s reserves.
 
As a result of this, BNB/USD fell to a low of $221.00, which comes a day after hitting a high of $264.25.
 
 
Overall, the token is now down by nearly 20% in the last week, and is down 10.88% as of writing.
 
Similar to cardano, the RSI on BNB is currently trading near the 24.00 mark, which is deep in oversold territory.
 
BNB is currently trading at its lowest point since July 13.

In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple and its current and former chief executives. The regulator alleged that they carried out $1.3 billion in sales of unregistered securities since the launch of Ripple’s native token, XRP.
 
 
Since then, the lawsuit has been deliberated upon in different dimensions, with several issues popping out once in a while.
 
Currently, the case is moving toward the Summary Judgement announcement even as the amicus curiae files a new request.

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) extended recent declines on Saturday, as markets continued to be nervous following recent uncertainty surrounding Binance’s proof-of-reserves audit.
 
The auditor in charge of the diligence, Mazars, opted to pause all of its work with crypto clients earlier this week, leading to a resurgence of bearish sentiment.
 
As a result of this news, BTC/USD fell for a third straight session, hitting a low of $16,584.70 to start the…</span>

                              <span>For the longest time, the meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) had been an Ethereum whale favorite. This support was driven by the rapid growth of the cryptocurrency that netted some of these whales millions of dollars in profit. However, with the crypto winter, SHIB has suffered one of the worst declines, causing Ethereum whales to move away from the meme coin.
 
Shiba Inu Falling Out Of Favor
 
At one point, the Shiba Inu holdings of the top 5,000 largest Ethereum whales had reached as high as $1 billion at its peak. Since then, there has been a steady decline in the price of the digital asset and the whales have exited a good portion of their positions over time.
 
 
Even at a time when Ethereum whales were reducing their SHIB holdings, the meme coin had managed to feature in their top 10 holding…</span>

SBF is held in custody at the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services (BDOCS), a jail called Fox Hill that is known for being filthy, and was accused of prison maltreatment last year.

                              <span>The BIS’ Basel Committee introduced a finalized proposal for limits to the amount of Tier 1 capital banks can hold in bitcoin.
The Bank for International Settlements&#x27; (BIS) Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has finalized a proposed policy that would place a 2% limit on banks&#x27; Tier 1 capital held in bitcoin. This comes with an endorsement from the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the oversight body of the Basel Committee, which is the “primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks.”
Investopedia defines Tier 1 capital as “the core capital held in a bank&#x27;s reserves [that] is used to fund business activities for the bank&#x27;s clients. It includes common stock, as well as disclosed reserves and certain other assets.” 
The policy includes bitcoin in its definition of Group 2 crypto assets, saying that “In addition to any tokenised traditional assets and stablecoins that fail the classification conditions, Group 2 includes all unbacked cryptoassets.” It later describes that “a bank’s total exposure to Group 2 cryptoassets should not generally be higher than 1% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital and must not exceed 2% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital.”

The BIS had previously considered a policy of 1% for global banks. In turn, the banks requested a 5% reserve limit. This 2% appears to be a compromise between the two. According to data from 2020, if applied to all banks in the world, who collectively custody approximately $180 trillion, this would amount to a limit of $3.6 trillion in bitcoin held by such entities. 
Tiff Macklem, Chair of the GHOS, stated that “Today&#x27;s endorsement by the GHOS marks an important milestone in developing a global regulatory baseline for mitigating risks to banks from cryptoassets. It is important to continue to monitor bank-related developments in cryptoasset markets. We remain ready to act further if necessary.”</span>
