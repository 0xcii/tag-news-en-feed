                              <span>Solana had previously touched $200 earlier in the year but this was only for a brief period before declining back down to $150. At this point, the Solana indicators are beginning to flash bullish, prompting crypto analysts to predict a resurgence above $200 for the altcoin.
 
Solana Shows Growth On D1 Timeframe
 
Crypto analyst Maximilian FX has predicted that the Solana price could be on its way to a resurgence. The analyst points to the ascending growth of SOL on the D1 timeframe as one of the reasons why the altcoin is set to recover.
 
 
Maximilian FX explains that the crypto market has also reversed from its bullish trend. This happened earlier in the week and the market began to recover once more, pushing the Bitcoin price above $63,000 for a brief period.

ODS emerges as a significant phenomenon within a segment of the Bitcoin community, characterized by an oversimplification and dismissive attitude toward Ordinals, often cavalier in nature. As an employee of Bitcoin Magazine, who remains neutral toward Ordinals but is tired of the baseless criticism aimed not just at our publication but at Bitcoin innovations at large, I feel compelled to share my perspective.

                              <span>For years, Bitcoin miners have toiled away, fueled by the promise of block rewards – newly minted coins earned for validating transactions. But a recent trend is changing the game, with transaction fees quietly usurping block rewards as the primary source of miner income. This shift, while unexpected, presents both opportunities and challenges for the future of Bitcoin.
 
 
Bitcoin: Transaction Fees On The Rise
 
Ki Young Ju, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis firm CryptoQuant, recently highlighted a significant change in the Bitcoin mining landscape. Transaction fees, once a minor contributor to miner income, have seen a dramatic rise. According to CryptoQuant’s data, transaction fees now account for over 7% of miners’ total income, a stark contrast to the meager 1% reported just two years ag…</span>

cryptocurrency project Terraform Labs, saying the platform was not performing

Responding to a question by a member of parliament,  
Lawrence Wong, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Chairman  
of the MAS, said that the collapse of Terraform Labs sparked concerns about  
regulatory oversight and investor protection in the cryptocurrency market. The

                              <span>Bitcoin is looking to enter into the $65,000 price terrain again amidst price volatility in the past 24 hours. The latest numbers from two different metrics suggest this could become a reality soon and Bitcoin could be on track to going on a price rally. As noted by a crypto analyst on social media, the Bitcoin funding rate and basis points to a “leg up.” 
 
Bitcoin Is Getting Ready
 
According to a post on social media by Will Clemente, a popular crypto analyst, both the funding rate and 3-month annualized basis for Bitcoin are starting to cool off after briefly reaching negative readings in the past few weeks. What this means is that long-position trades for the asset are starting to dominate as investors regain confidence in its potential price action in the coming weeks.

                              <span>In a rebuttal against accusations of bribery levelled by  
Binance Holdings Ltd, Nigeria has refuted claims made by the cryptocurrency  
firm, dismissing them as a diversionary tactic. The West African nation has  
been involved in a boisterous saga with Binance.
Binance&#x27;s Allegations of Bribery in  
Nigeria
The rift deepened following a blog post penned by Binance&#x27;s  
Chief Executive Officer, Richard Teng, alleging coercive demands for a  
&quot;secret&quot; payment to resolve issues within Nigeria. Teng&#x27;s revelation  
ignited a firestorm, casting a shadow over the already strained relationship  
between Binance and Nigerian authorities.
The alleged bribery attempts purportedly occurred during a  
meeting between Binance representatives and Nigerian officials in Abuja earlier  
this year. Teng clai…</span>

                              <span>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, along with collaborators Sam Wilson, Ansgar Dietrichs, and Matt Garnett, has proposed a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) numbered 7702, designed to significantly enhance the functionality of Ethereum’s externally owned accounts (EOAs). EIP-7702 aims to integrate smart contract functionalities temporarily into EOAs, a transformative concept that might redefine user interactions on the Ethereum network.
 
Evolution Of Account Abstraction On Ethereum
 
Ethereum’s account model includes two primary types: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts. EOAs are controlled by private keys and have limited capabilities and security features, which restrict their use in more complex transactions typically reserved for smart contracts.

This comes as Argentina embraces Bitcoin with the election of Bitcoin-friendly President Javier Milei in late 2023.
