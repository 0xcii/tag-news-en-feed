According to a report by Galaxy, the total venture capital investment in crypto

from the previous quarter. Similarly, the number of deals also fell by 17%,

ETFSwap (ETFS) Shows Promising Signs Of Long-term Prospects And Sustainability 
The core feature of ETFSwap (ETFS) lies in its ability to tokenize Spot ETFs. By tokenizing real-world assets, including gold, oil, and corn, ETFSwap (ETFS) taps into the massive ETF market and serves as a bridge linking both traditional ETFs and cryptocurrency-focused ETFs.

Why The Dogecoin Price Rallied By Over 7%
 
The Dogecoin price rallied by over 7% following Musk’s tweet, in which he alluded to ‘D.O.G.E.’ Musk simply said in his post, “D.O.G.E will fix it,” in response to another post asserting that politicians and bureaucrats are the greatest threat to human progress and flourishing. 
 
 
The acronym stands for the ‘Department of Government Efficiency,’ a position that Musk could occupy under a Donald Trump administration. The former US President has said that if elected, he wants to use Musk’s expertise to curb exce…</span>
