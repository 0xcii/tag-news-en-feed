The state watchdog noted that the exchange has been offering the service without prior permission and in violation of state laws.
According to the regulator, at least 644,470 California residents were active investors in Coinbase&#x27;s crypto staking-as-a-service programme as of March 29 this year. These investors held over $1.2 billion in investments.

In a recent testimony before the US House Committee on Agriculture, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, highlighted the need for Congressional action to address the lack of federal regulation over the digital commodity market.
