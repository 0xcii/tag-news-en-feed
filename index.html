                              <span>Google Cloud enters the blockchain infrastructure industry by joining Flare as a network validator and infrastructure provider, causing Flare’s token FLR to jump in price.
 
Flare Network Welcomes Google Cloud, FLR token surges
 
Google Cloud has joined the Flare network as a network validator and infrastructure provider. Flare, self-described as “the blockchain for data,” is working to improve the way developers access decentralized data through its oracle system. Google Cloud is one of more than 100 organizations in this dual role.
 
In addition to validating transactions on the Flare blockchain, Google Cloud will also contribute to the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO). A blockchain oracle is a bridge that connects blockchain networks to external data sources, enabling smart contracts to …</span>

Chainlink’s Integration Of CCTP
 
According to a press release, the integration of CCTP expands the potential use cases for USDC, providing developers building with Chainlink CCIP the ability to leverage the protocol for various cross-chain applications. 
 
The co-founder of Chainlink, Sergey Nazarov, expressed enthusiasm for supporting the adoption of stablecoins in different cross-chain scenarios.

USDC CEX Market Share Rises 2X
 
This development is noteworthy considering the depressed USDC activity in the first half of 2023 following the continuation of the crypto bear market. The recovery also follows fundamental changes in Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, that saw the platform delist USDC in their bid to concentrate liquidity and increase market share for the now-delisted BUSD.
