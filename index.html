                              <span>CleanSpark Inc. has announced the purchase of 12,500 Antminer S19 XP bitcoin mining machines for a total price of $40.5 million. The machines were acquired at a lower price than the current market average, costing $23 per terahash, according to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. The purchase agreement states that 6,000 of the machines will be shipped in June, with the remaining 6,500 set for shipping in August.
Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, expressed his confidence in the purchase, stating, &quot;This purchase ensures that we are prepared to meet and potentially exceed our year-end target of 16 EH/s and also positions us to be one of the most power-efficient miners on an energy-per-hashrate basis.&quot; He further highlighted the optionality provided by the additional machines, allowing the company to replace less efficient units if the economics support it.
CleanSpark reported that it has been taking advantage of discounted machine purchases during the crypto bear market. In February, the company acquired 20,000 Antminer S19j Pro+ units, followed by the purchase of 45,000 Antminer S19 XP units in April. 
Gary A. Vecchiarelli, CFO at CleanSpark, emphasized the importance of these purchases in preparation for the upcoming bitcoin halving, stating, &quot;the efficiency of these machines also results in less power consumed per bitcoin mined compared to older generation miners, which should translate to higher margins.&quot;
CleanSpark&#x27;s recent purchases of bitcoin mining machines demonstrate the company&#x27;s commitment to expanding their mining capacity and staying competitive in the market. With fees from Ordinals inscriptions boosting the revenue for miners, it is expected that large players like CleanSpark will continue to bolster their miner inventory.</span>

                              <span>A Bloomberg report revealed that the American investment bank, TD Cowen, has shut down its crypto asset unit. According to the report, Cowen Digital will pack up by June 1, which will be the last day for its team. There’s no explanation for the action, which is coming just a year after the bank launched it.
 
We Won’t Give Up Digital Assets Even With The Closure; Cowen Digital
 
Even though Cowen Digital has shut its doors, the team reiterated its commitment to crypto services and not giving up on digital assets. However, they could shift to a different organization.
 
 
In an email reported by Bloomberg, the team wrote:

                              <span>Litecoin rose by as much as 6% in today’s session, as the token climbed past a key resistance level on Thursday. The move came following several attempts over several weeks, with bulls finally breaking through. Polygon was also higher, ending a recent losing streak. 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was one of Thursday’s notable gainers, as prices moved past a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $88.35 on Thursday, LTC/USD rose to an intraday peak at $94.21 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s rally, litecoin broke out of its recent ceiling at $93.00, hitting a two-week high in the process.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that Thursday’s surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 58.00.
 
Since the breakout, the index has continued to climb, and as of writing this is currently tracking at 59.76.
 
In the event momentum continues in this direction, there is a strong chance that LTC will move above $95.00.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) snapped a three-day losing streak on Thursday, following a crossover of moving averages (MA).
 
The 10-day (red) MA crossed its 25-day (blue) counterpart in today’s session, sending the price to a peak of $0.8974.
 
This comes following Wednesday’s low at $0.8787, which saw MATIC hit its weakest point since May 25.
 
 
Overall, market volatility in polygon remains significantly high, with earlier gains almost fading.
 
As of writing, MATIC is trading at $0.8934, with the RSI at a reading of 46.03, which is close to a ceiling of 48.00.
 
Should this aforementioned point of resistance be broken, bulls could force a move toward $0.9000.

                              <span>On-chain data shows the Ethereum average transaction fees have dropped by almost 70% since early May. Here’s what it may mean for the asset.
 
Ethereum Average Transaction Fees Has Sharply Declined Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the average fee on the network was around $14 not too long ago. The “average transaction fees” here naturally refers to the total amount of fees (in USD) that the average user is attaching with their transfers right now.
 
This indicator’s value is dependent on the amount of traffic that the Ethereum network is receiving currently. Whenever the traffic on the blockchain is low, the users have no need to attach exorbitant amounts of fees as the network usually has enough capacity to handle the transactions quickly anyway.

Tether Market Cap Skyrockets to $83.23 Billion, Breaking Previous May 2022 Record
 
With a market cap of $83.23 billion, tether (USDT) has now surpassed the stablecoin’s prior highest market capitalization. The previous peak in market cap happened just before Terra’s formerly stable coin UST lost its peg on May 9, 2023. On that day, USDT’s market cap stood at $83.2 billion, but by June 1, 2022, it had decreased to $72 billion. Following FTX’s collapse, USDT’s market valuation had dipp…</span>

While Zhao denied the allegations, he went ahead to express the industry’s ever-changing dynamics and the need to stay agile. Particularly, Binance emphasizes its commitment to talent optimization and cost efficiency.
