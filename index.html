Digital Assets To Account For 10% Of Global Assets
 
According to the report, digital assets are expected to account for up to 10% of all assets by 2030. That means the market could be valued at over $14.5 trillion since these financial firms also project that the global asset market could rise to as high as $145.4 trillion by 2025.

According to a statement

managed to compromise Terra&#x27;s website and have since attempted to initiate  
phishing scams that could potentially compromise users&#x27; information. Thus, the  
official Terra&#x27;s account has issued a cautionary advisory, urging users to remain

                              <span>Litecoin was back in the green to start the week, despite the crypto market continuing to trend mostly lower. At the time of writing, the global market cap is down 0.59%, following a recent red wave. Ethereum classic also climbed higher on Monday, hitting a four-day high in the process.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) rose for a third consecutive session on Monday, as the token continued to move away from a recent nine-month low.
 
Following a bottom at $64.33 on Sunday, LTC/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $66.70 earlier in the day.
 
LTC has mostly been in the green since falling to its lowest point since November, during last week’s session.
 
 
As a result of recent bearish momentum, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) dropped below the 20.00 mark.
 
Currently, the index is at a reading of 21.13, which is marginally below an upcoming resistance level of 23.00.
 
If litecoin were to break out of this level, the next price target will likely be $70.00.
 
 
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
 
Additionally, ethereum classic also moved higher to start the week, following a recent drop below a floor at $15.00.
 
ETC/USD rose to a high of $15.90 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $15.38.
 
 
Today’s peak sees ethereum classic trade at its highest point since last Thursday, when price was over $16.00.
 
Price strength on ETC is now hovering around 28.00, with a ceiling of 29.00 the next obstacle to overcome.
 
Should it rise beyond this hurdle, there is a good chance that ETC will be above $16.00.

However, as the metaverse gains momentum, China’s reported plans to implement a system resembling its infamous social credit system within this virtual landscape are causing widespread concern.
 
According to a recent POLITICO report, China is considering the implementation of a digital identification system for users of the metaverse and other online virtual worlds. 
 
 
State-owned telecommunications giant China Mobile is said to have proposed a digital ID that encompasses both “natural characteristics” and “social characteristics” of users.

                              <span>Genesis Digital Assets (GDA), one of the worlds largest Bitcoin miners in terms of hash rate, has announced the inauguration of its new mining facility situated in the northern reaches of Sweden, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. The data center&#x27;s capacity is currently 8 megawatts (MW), with plans for further expansion &quot;in the near future,&quot; and has been operational since June 2023.
The new facility is strategically located near the 417 MW Porjus Hydroelectric Power Station, known for its carbon-free electricity production. GDA aims to take advantage of this renewable energy source for its Bitcoin mining operations.
&quot;With abundant energy sources, a pro-innovation environment, and a strong educational system that results in a great culture of innovation, we believe that Sweden is one of the best countries in the world where to mine bitcoin and expect to further invest in this beautiful region moving forward,&quot; commented Tim Carra, Head of Nordic Operations at GDA.
GDA has collaborated with a local company help to oversee the day-to-day operations of the new facility. The facility, which was once a conventional data center, marks GDA&#x27;s third venture in Sweden within a three-year span, including a greenhouse data center pilot introduced in 2020.
&quot;Our expansion of facilities in the Nordics is a testament to our unwavering commitment to utilizing green energy sources,&quot; said Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, Executive President and Co-Founder of GDA. &quot;We aim to lead the bitcoin mining industry by setting an example for other players by minimizing our environmental impact.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Bankrupt  
crypto exchange, FTX, and its debtors have suggested reducing the maximum settled value for &quot;small estate claims&quot; from $10  
million to $7 million. The change followed opposition by the US Trustee to the settlement proposal previously put forward by the exchange.
FTX Adjusts Terms for Small Estate Claims
The FTX and its debtors in a court document filed on Sunday noted that the  
US Trustee, which is the office in the US Department of Justice that oversees  
the administration of bankruptcy cases, criticized the move. They argued  
that the objection should be overruled and the motion granted.
“The US  
Trustee—the sole objector to the Motion—seeks to inject itself into a  
routine settlement process that is already adequately safeguarded by two  
different creditor committees,”…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin rebounded from this weekend’s low on Monday, as markets attempted to consolidate following recent losses. The cryptocurrency rose back above the $26,000 level, after a brief stint below this point. Ethereum also settled, after declines over the weekend.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was marginally higher to start the week, as the cryptocurrency climbed back above the $26,000 level on Monday.
 
Following a low of $25,919.02 on Sunday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday peak at $26,260.68 earlier in the day.
 
Overall, bitcoin traders seem to have found a semi-stable floor around the $25,900 mark, and now look set to potentially recover some of last week’s gains.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 

 
Looking at the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 20.57, which is still deep in the oversold region.
 
This could work out to benefit bulls however, as bearish momentum may be fully exhausted after last week’s run.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was marginally higher on Monday, as price continued to settle around a new support point.
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,692.33 to start the week, as bulls attempted to take the world’s second largest cryptocurrency back above $1,700.
 
The jump in price came as ethereum settled on a support point around the $1,650 mark, with bulls using this as a point of reentry.
 
 
Ethereum chart by TradingView
 

 
 
Similar to bitcoin above, the 14-day RSI remains oversold, and is currently tracking around the 25.00 region.
 
From the chart, the next visible point of resistance seems to be at the 31.00 level, which bulls will likely be targeting.
 
Should they break out of this point, ETH will likely move back above $1,700.

                              <span>Ethereum (ETH) is once again under the spotlight as the cryptocurrency market flirts with the influence of traditional financial instruments. 
 
The hype centers around the possibility of multiple Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) being listed in the United States. 
 
This development, if realized, could emerge as a significant catalyst propelling Ether’s price to unprecedented heights, as it has the potential to attract substantial institutional capital.
 
 
What Are Ethereum Futures ETFs? 
 
Ethereum Futures ETFs represent a bridge between the world of cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets. 
 
An ETF is a type of investment fund traded on stock exchanges, mirroring the price movements of a specific asset or a group of assets.

A dangerous trend has emerged in the United States that is seeing terms like “free speech,” “censorship resistant,” “privacy” and more become co-opted by those on the political right, while tools enabling these principles are argued and fought against by those on the political left. The truth is that freedom, privacy and censorship-resistant technologies are important for everyone, regardless of political leanings and they should not be politicized, lest we head down the path toward a dystopian future with no privacy or free speech guarantees, and only centralized institutions controlled by people with the ability to censor, revoke and remove important guarantees of freedom promoted in the spirit and language …</span>
