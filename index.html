                              <span>Xrp moved to a multi-month high on Jan. 23, as market optimism grew regarding a lawsuit between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following comments last week from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, many have bought the token in anticipation of the lawsuit ending in the coming months. Dogecoin was another notable gainer on Monday.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was one of Monday’s notable gainers, as the token rose to a three-month high in today’s session.
 
XRP/USD hit an intraday high of $0.431 to start the week, coming off the back of Sunday’s low at $0.3979.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, XRP has risen to its strongest point since November 8.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move took place following a breakout of a ceiling at the $0.410 resistance level.
 
As of writing, XRP is still trading above this point, however earlier gains have eased, with price now at $0.420.
 
Momentum has eased, with traders seemingly securing gains as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is tracking at 68.64, nears a ceiling at 69.00.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
In addition to XRP, dogecoin (DOGE) started the week stronger, with the meme coin hovering close to a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $0.0861 on Sunday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.09289 earlier today.
 
This surge saw dogecoin briefly break out of a resistance point at $0.09200, closing in on a six-week high in the process.
 
 
As can be seen on the chart, this breakout was not sustained, with the meme coin now trading below $0.09000.
 
One of the reasons behind the afternoon’s decline is the fact that price strength has encountered a hurdle of its own.
 
Currently the RSI is tracking at 63.51, which is slightly below a ceiling at the 64.00 mark, and seems to have panicked earlier bulls.

                              <span>The GameFi industry has been hit hard during the 2022 crypto winter which wiped billions off the crypto market. Axie Infinity is one of the projects that were pummeled to the ground. According to a July 2022 report by CheersLand, the native token of Axie Infinity, AXS, has lost 91% of its value in the third quarter of last year. 
 
But with the reinvigorated crypto sentiment in the market, AXS has seen growth since the start of the year. According to CoinGecko, the token is up 43% in the past 24 hours with the biggest gain being made in the bi-weekly time frame. 
 
Despite negative developments on-chain, this rise in price might be a sign of revival for Axie Infinity.

In a recently updated code of advertising practice published by the South Africa Advertising Regulatory Board(ARB) on Monday, the country introduced some new guidelines aimed at the crypto advertisements sector, particularly protecting consumers from unethical advertising.
 
South Africa Mandates New Guidelines To Crypto Ads
 
The new guidelines refer to companies and individuals dealing with cryptocurrency products and services in South Africa, mandating them to abide by Section III of the country’s advertising code.
