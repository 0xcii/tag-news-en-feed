Binance Contemplates Leaving Russian Markets For Good
 
Binance, the company that operates the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has found itself in another regulatory predicament and has stated that it is currently deliberating discontinuing its crypto business operations in Russia.
 
 
Reports have claimed that Binance has been assisting Russians in moving funds abroad. According to the Wall Street Journal, the exchange has seemingly been aiding excommunicated Russian lenders to transport money through peer-to-peer transactions on it…</span>

                              <span>August has proved to be a challenging month for bitcoin miners, facing two difficulty spikes and witnessing the currency’s value plummet over 10% in the past 30 days. This decline in value has pulled the network’s hash price to levels reminiscent of late 2022. At present, miners receive roughly $60 daily for every petahash per second (PH/s) they produce, as indicated by the prevailing hash price. 
 
Bitcoin’s Hash Price Tumbles to Depths Uncharted Since Late 2022
 
While there’s still two days left of August, data reveals miners have garnered $717.14 million, of which the subsidy accounted for a hefty $702.12 million. Back in July, the total miner earnings stood at $865.26 million, with a significant $846.04 million emerging from newly minted bitcoins.

Bitcoin Transaction Volume Has Continued To Be Low Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the BTC transaction volume has seen a decline of 90% since the peak in mid-2022. The “transaction volume” here refers to a measure of the daily total amount of Bitcoin that’s being moved around on the blockchain.
 
This metric accounts for all types of transactions, whether they be peer-to-peer (P2P) ones, exchange deposits or withdrawals, or the fees that miners receive. As such, the indicator can provide a look into how active the blockchain as a whole is currently.

                              <span>BNB surged this afternoon, as markets reacted to the news a court in the United States was siding with Grayscale in its case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The court said the SEC was wrong to deny Grayscale permission to migrate its bitcoin product into an ETF. Toncoin also rallied, hitting its strongest point since June. 
 
BNB
 
Since hitting a one-year low last week, BNB has mostly moved higher in recent days, with today’s surge coming after the latest U.S. consumer confidence report.
 
Following a low of $217.05 to start the week, BNB/USD moved to a peak of $233.06 earlier in today’s session.
 
This has resulted in the native token of cryptocurrency exchange Binance climbing to its highest point since August 16.
 
 
Tuesday’s gain came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) jumped beyond a key resistance level of 53.00.
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking marginally above this point at 54.13, with a ceiling at 55.00 awaiting.
 
Earlier gains have somewhat diminished, as traders liquidated their positions in fear of a reversal close to this zone.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was another notable gainer on Tuesday, as it raced to its highest point in over two months.
 
TON/USD climbed to an intraday high at $1.63 earlier in today’s session, following a low of $1.49 on Monday.
 
As a result of this rise in price, toncoin has moved to its strongest level since June 10, when it peaked at $1.68.
 
 
This comes as the RSI jumped past a resistance level of 66.00. It currently tracking at 70.41.
 
Due to price strength being overbought, bears are likely going to be lurking, and waiting for an opportunity to reenter.

                              <span>Today, it was announced that the DC Circuit court of appeals is vacating SEC&#x27;s denial of Grayscale&#x27;s $GBTC conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF. 
&quot;We agree,&quot; said Circuit Judge RAO. &quot;The denial of Grayscale&#x27;s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products. We therefore grant Grayscale&#x27;s petition and vacate the order.&quot;
 
         
         
         
         
    
It is important to note that this does not mean GBTC is automatically being converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, although this victory does bring us one step closer to that reality. The order is being vacated and sent back to the SEC. The SEC now has 45 days to appeal and file for an en banc hearing, which means the case will be heard by all 17 judges on the court instead of just the three that were involved in today&#x27;s decision, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. 
&quot;The Commission neither disputed Grayscale&#x27;s evidence that the spot and future markets for bitcoin are 99.9% correlated, nor suggested that market inefficiencies or other factors would undermine the correlation...The Commission’s unexplained discounting of the obvious financial and mathematical relationship between the spot and futures markets falls short of the standard for reasoned decision making,&quot; Circuit Judge RAO. continued.
The price of GBTC pumped over 19% on the news and Bitcoin rose above 5%.</span>
