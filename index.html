The proposed framework provides a clear and consistent approach for taxpayers to claim deductions on cryptocurrency losses.

                              <span>Bitcoin (BTC) investors are showing a high level of optimism despite the recent price volatility, with the Fear &amp; Greed Index tracked by Coinstats Explorer indicating a strong and bullish market sentiment. Currently, at a level of 64, the index is very close to the year’s high, suggesting that investors are more greedy than fearful.
 
 
The Fear &amp; Greed Index uses a variety of factors, including social media posts and Google Trends, to gauge the mood of the bitcoin market and assigns a score from 0 to 100.  A score above 55 indicates a prevailing sense of greed, while a score below 45 indicates fear. Despite recent price fluctuations between USD 31,000 and USD 26,600, the index shows that BTC investors remain optimistic about the future of the cryptocurrency.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>According to regulations published by the country’s treasury secretary, global crypto exchanges used by Kenya’s estimated 4 million users will start paying a 1.5% tax on revenues earned. 
 
Tax-Avoiding Digital Asset Platforms
 
The Kenyan Treasury has said it will start levying taxes on revenues earned by cryptocurrency exchanges used by an estimated 4 million local residents. According to a report by Business Daily Africa, Kenyan authorities will rely on the 1.5% digital tax service that became effective on Jan.1, 2021.
 
Initially proposed in 2020, the digital tax is the Kenyan government’s attempt to extract revenue from leading crypto exchanges and tax-avoiding digital asset platforms. As reported by Bitcoin.com News in early January 2021, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) said it expected to get $45.5 million (5 billion Kenyan shillings) from the tax.
 
Meanwhile, as shown in the 2023 regulations’ value added tax (electronic, internet and digital marketplace supply) published by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung’u, Kenya can now target global crypto exchanges.
 
“For the purposes of these Regulations, a taxable electronic, Internet or digital marketplace supply include…facilitation of online payment for, exchange or transfer of digital assets excluding services exempted under the Act,” the published regulations state.
 

 
Alongside Nigeria and South Africa, Kenya has one of Africa’s highest proportions of the population owning crypto. However, like its peers on the continent, Kenya has not recognized cryptocurrencies. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and its governor have warned residents against dealing with crypto assets like bitcoin.
 
Despite the warnings, Kenyan residents continue to acquire and trade cryptocurrencies and this has prompted the government to seek ways to levy taxes on crypto transactions.

The Case Against Coinme And Related Defendants 
 
Back In 2017, Coinme and Up Global conducted an initial coin offering for the Ethereum-based asset UpToken with the aim of raising funds to expand Coinme ATM operations across the country.

                              <span>Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he&#x27;s living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. &quot;I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re capitalist or you&#x27;re a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We&#x27;ve passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,&quot; he said. &quot;And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that&#x27;s outside of the traditional banking system.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Anthony Scaramucci of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital got burned by Sam Bankman-Fried: he co-hosted SALT conferences with FTX and sold a 30% stake in SkyBridge to FTX Ventures. And yet &quot;The Mooch&quot; tells Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott &quot;I&#x27;m more bullish now than I have ever been&quot; on crypto as an investment case. He discusses his frustration with SBF, how wrong he thinks politicians like Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler are about crypto and how to regulate it, what he sees happening next with adoption, and talks about Trump.
