                              <span>According to a report, former National Football League quarterback Tom Brady was paid $55 million to feature in the collapse cryptocurrency exchange FTX’s advertisements. As part of the arrangement, Brady would devote 20 hours of his time each year for three years. 
 
Celebrities Paid to Promote FTX
 
The former U.S. National Football League (NFL) quarterback Tom Brady was paid $55 million just to feature in the collapse crypto exchange FTX’s sports commercials. Brady’s fellow celebrity sportsman and basketball star Stephen Curry was reportedly paid $35 million to promote the crypto exchange.
 

 
Details of Brady and Curry’s outsized payments from Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)’s crypto exchange were made public by author Micheal Lewis. In his comments made during an interview, Lewis, who claims to have seen confidential documents that back his story, said as part of the deal Brady would devote just 20 hours of his time each year for three years.
 
Despite receiving millions of dollars worth of FTX stock as payment right before the crypto exchange’s collapse, Brady is thought to have suffered a loss of $30 million. As previously reported by Bitcoin.com News, Brady’s then-wife Gisele Bündchen similarly saw her net worth drop by $18 million after her FTX stock went up in smoke.
 
 
Discussing SBF’s then blossoming friendship with Brady, the author Lewis reportedly said:
 
“He really liked Tom Brady. And Sam wasn’t, like, a big sports person, so it was funny to watch that interaction. It was like, ‘These two people actually get along.’ It’s like the class nerd and the quarterback.”
 
However, according to Lewis, after FTX’s abrupt collapse in late 2022, an angry Brady was of the opinion that Bankman-Fried had tricked him into endorsing the crypto exchange. At that point, the former NFL quarterback did not want to “have anything to do with it [FTX] anymore.”

In a post on October 4, the analyst said the level of subsidy is “shocking” but will come to “harm SOL prices in the long term. “
 
Are Solana Validators Heavily Subsidized?
 
Solana is a high-throughput blockchain that aims to compete with Ethereum. It combines proof-of-stake (PoS) with proof-of-history (PoH) as a consensus method.
 
 
Validators play a crucial role in this architecture since they verify the validity of transactions and add them to the blockchain while ensuring the network remains secure and decentralized. A node must stake SOL to become a validator, w…</span>

                              <span>Cryptocurrencies have taken center stage in a significant crackdown on the illicit production and distribution of fentanyl and methamphetamine. In a significant move against the illicit production of these dangerous drugs, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has unsealed eight indictments. 
 
The indictments also encompassed crimes associated with the sale of precursor chemicals, shining a light on the multifaceted nature of the illegal drug trade. 
 
What sets this operation apart is the integration of cryptocurrency into the criminal enterprise, allowing wrongdoers to conceal their identities and obscure financial trails.

Department of Justice (DOJ) claimed that his crypto business had problems from  
the beginning. The Assistant US Attorney Nathan Rehn described him as someone  
who deceived customers and used their money for his own gain, including wealth  
and political influence, as reported by Coindesk.
According to Rehn, Bankman-Fried diverted customers&#x27; funds to  
a &quot;smaller and secretive&quot; company called Alameda Research, using them  
for personal luxuries and political donations. The prosecution alleges that  
Bankman-Fried took over $10 billion from FTX to settle Alameda Research&#x27;s debts  
and attempted to cover up his actions by creating false financial statements.

Bitcoin Supply Aged More Than 5 Years Is Only Continuing To Grow
 
In a new post on X, analyst James V. Straten shared a chart that reveals the supply distribution of coins aged more than five years. The investors with coins this old make up a segment of the “long-term holders (LTHs),” which is a cohort that includes all addresses carrying their Bitcoin since at least 155 days ago.
 
Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell or transfer the coins at any point. Due to this reason, the LTHs are the resolute hands of the market, who rarely sell even during periods of high profits or losses.
