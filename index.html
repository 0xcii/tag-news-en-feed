After Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the United States House of Representatives, announced his intention to repeal the tens of billions in funding that was approved for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) last year, House Republicans voted on a bill that aims to eliminate the federal income tax and replace it with a “Fair Tax” and a national consumption tax that would be collected by eac…</span>

Bitcoin Miners Might Find Relief After A Period Of Immense Pressure
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the average cost of production for miners is now around the current price levels. The relevant indicator here is the “difficulty regression model,” which is an estimation of the cost of Bitcoin production that the average miner incurs.
 
As the name already implies, this model is based on the concept of “mining difficulty,” which is a built-in feature on the BTC blockchain that decides how hard miners will need to work in order to successfully mine a block on the network.
 
For this model, Glassnode has made the…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin continued to trade higher on Jan. 13, with prices racing above the $19,000 level, hitting a two-month peak in the process. The latest surge comes as traders continued to react to Wednesday’s U.S. inflation report, which dropped to 6.5%. Ethereum also rose today, hitting a fresh multi-month high.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a two-month high earlier in today’s session, as prices climbed above the $19,000 mark.
 
Following a low of $17,995.20 on Thursday, BTC/USD moved to a peak of $19,031.80 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed to its strongest point since November 8, when price was above $20,000.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose to a peak of 82.00, which was its highest mark in over a year.
 
In addition to this, the upwards trend on the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages continued to mature, thus extending bullish momentum.
 
Despite this, prices are now well beyond overbought, which could mean that bears are lurking and preparing for reentry.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Like BTC, ethereum (ETH) also significantly rose on Friday, with price moving above the $1,400 mark.
 
ETH/USD hit an intraday high of $1,432.28 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after trading at a bottom of $1,378.42.
 
As with bitcoin, this spike in price has pushed ethereum to its highest point since November 8, when it hit a high of $1,580.
 
 
From the chart, prices of ETH are now deep in overbought territory, with the RSI index tracking at a level of 75.54.
 
Earlier gains have already begun to slip, as previous bulls have begun taking profits in anticipation of a reversal in momentum.
 
As of writing, ETH/USD is trading at $1,410.60.

This is an opinion editorial by Frances Hogan Steffian, a writer, bitcoin investor and wife of an award-winning architect.
What should be the architectural styles of Bitcoin? In the history of our world, our enduring buildings give stature to our best ideas and enshrine our core beliefs. If Bitcoin realizes its potential to remake the world’s financial system, and as Bitcoin communities spring up around the globe, how should our ideas and ideals about Bitcoin be expressed in these newly-built environments?

Crypto Awareness in Oman
 
According to the findings of a new study by Souq Analyst, approximately 65,000 Oman residents, or 1.9% of the country’s adult population, own cryptocurrency. However, despite the seemingly low ratio of crypto holders relative to its population, the findings suggest that crypto awareness in Oman is significantly high. The report explains:
 

An impressive 97.9% of Omani adults have heard about cryptocurrency, indicating an increasing level of awareness.

The Singapore-based payment solutions provider has a major research and development hub across Asia that has pioneered new payment systems at the very edge of modern fintech – convenient payments that seamlessly enable the movement of funds between traditional fiat currency and cryptocurrency.
 
After its establishment in 2018, Alchemy Pay became Southeast Asia’s number one crypto payment system. 2022 saw Alchemy Pay move to d2c solutions for the first time. Its on and off-ramp and NFT checkout were all launched in Q3 and Q4 last year. The constant upgrades a…</span>

                              <span>Attorney John Deaton, who is proactively supporting more than 75,000 XRP investors in the legal fight between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through an amicus brief, has published his predictions for the year 2023 on Twitter.
 
Even though the statements come a bit late – one prediction has already come true – there is one prediction in particular that is causing a stir. In a tweet, the lawyer deeply involved in the litigation wrote:
 

1) The Ripple case does not settle until AFTER we get a decision from Judge Torres; 
2) An exchange (maybe more than one) is sued for selling unregistered securities;  
3) Investigation into SBFraud meetings uncovers bad stuff; 
4) Gensler resigns before the EOY.

                              <span>Amid the mini bull run, massive layoffs between companies are still happening. Just in the past few weeks, a handful of crypto firms have reduced their workforce by a certain percentage, and the latest on the list today is Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange, Crypto.com.
 
The company earlier today announced a global cut-off of its workforce, expressing how difficult it is to implement this decision. Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Crypto.com, said in a company update published Friday morning, “Today we made the difficult decision to reduce our global workforce by approximately 20%.”

However, David Schwartz, Ripple CTO, appears displeased about it. In a recent tweet, he claims the current holding rules for Flare tokens lack incentive. As a result, Schwartz enjoined the airdrop receivers to sell their Flare tokens quickly.
