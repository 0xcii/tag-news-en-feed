Solana Rises To As High As $136
 
Data from CoinMarketCap shows that SOL rose to as high as $136 and almost hit $137 in its latest move to the upside. This rally from the crypto token comes following a New York Times report that Bankman-Fried was offering investment advice to the prison guards and explicitly asked them to invest in SOL.

                              <span>Analysts from JP Morgan, an American multinational financial corporation, have disclosed the potential for a significant price correction in Bitcoin, predicting that the cryptocurrency could see its price drop to $42,000 after the Bitcoin halving event.  
 
Bitcoin Price Prediction Post Halving
 
While many crypto analysts foresee Bitcoin’s dramatic rise to new all-time following the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event, JP Morgan analysts have remained bearish.

Bayo Onanuga, speaking on behalf of President Bola Tinubu’s administration, laid bare the government’s grievances, asserting, “The platform fixes the exchange rate for the country and it is an illegal rate. The CBN is the only authority that can fix the exchange rate for the country.”
