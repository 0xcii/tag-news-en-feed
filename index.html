XRP Presents An Opportunity To Become Incredibly Wealthy
 
Versan Aljarrah, a prominent member of the XRP community, recently shared a clip on his X (formerly Twitter) platform. In the clip, Miles Franklin CEO Andy Schetman makes a case for XRP and how it can allow everyone to become “incredibly wealthy.” He noted how XRP’s price allows anyone to throw in a “modest amount of money” and still make good returns.  
 
Schetman also spoke about De-dollarization and warned about the need to embrace or get “rolled by the changes.” …</span>

                              <span>Wall Street is on a Bitcoin buying spree, acquiring the digital asset at a staggering rate 12.5 times greater than its daily production, according to industry expert Anthony Pompliano. This relentless accumulation hints at big money’s growing conviction in the cypto’s future, fueled by the approaching “halving” event and the recent green light for ETFs.
 
 
Imagine printing money, then cutting production in half. That’s essentially what happens with Bitcoin’s halving, scheduled for April 2024. Every four years, the reward for mining new Bitcoins gets slashed, gradually reducing the total supply to a predetermined 21 million. This built-in scarcity is a major draw for institutions, who anticipate a price surge as demand outpaces supply.

However, the court docket entry did not specify any reason for the delay in the sentencing. The original sentencing was scheduled for February 23, as Zhao faces about 18 months in prison.
CZ’s Sentencing Postponed
Zhao pleaded guilty to one count of money laundering last November and agreed to step down from the role of CEO at Binance as a part of the plea deal. He further paid $50 million personally in penalty for compliance lapses.
