In a new post on X (formerly Twitter), Julio Moreno, the Head of Research at the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQaunt, has talked about whether Binance is experiencing a bank run or not.

The cloud storage giant revealed in a blog post that its popular Unlimited Advanced plan will be replaced by a metered storage option, allotting new users a substantial 15 terabytes of storage capacity — a quantum leap that could easily accommodate a staggering 100 million documents.

The funds were securely stored in DEA-controlled accounts, protected within a Trezor hardware-based wallet at a “highly secure” facility. However, the agency’s vigilance was soon compromised by a scammer who capitalized on a well-known crypto scam.
