                              <span>Polygon (MATIC) has been one of the best performers among the largest cryptocurrencies in the last week. With bitcoin’s run-up above $25,000, MATIC saw tremendous gains that would see it rise above 21% in a seven-day period. As a result, the digital asset has been able to surpass Dogecoin (DOGE) by market cap, and the next target looks to be Cardano (ADA).
 
Polygon Flips Dogecoin, Looks To Cardano
 
The advent of the ZK Sync narrative has played in the favor of Polygon so far as the digital asset rallied to new one-year highs. Since then, Polygon has been on a winning streak which eventually saw its market cap rise above that of Dogecoin. With this, MATIC is now the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

Core Helium Devs Reveal Network Migration Date to Move to Solana
 
The Helium Network, a chain dedicated to the internet of things (IoT), plans to migrate with the Solana blockchain network, according to a blog post published by the core devs. The Helium Foundation has scheduled a migration date after “months of meticulous planning and technical development,” according to the post. The Helium team said the upgrade will take place on March 27, 2023, at 10 a.m. ET.

Market sentiment has mostly been bullish in the past two weeks, leading to prices hitting a multi-month high on Monday. Bitcoin cash also surged, climbing to its strongest level since July.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) rose by over 11% in Monday’s session, as the token raced to a multi-month high earlier in the day.
 
Following a low of $24.04 on Sunday, SOL/USD surged to an intraday peak of $26.93 to start the week.
 
As a result of this move, solana climbed to its highest level since November 8, when price hit a high of $31.78.
 
 
This is the fourth straight session that solana has risen, with prices breaking out of a key resistance level of $26.00 in the process.
 
In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has moved beyond a ceiling of its own at 62.00.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 63.58, and should it continue in this upward direction, SOL could hit $30.00 in the coming days.
 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Another notable gainer on Monday has been bitcoin cash (BCH), which also moved to its highest point in the past several months..
 
BCH/USD raced to a high of $146.83 earlier in the day, which comes after trading at a bottom of $134.55 on Sunday.
 
The rally took bitcoin cash to a point not seen since July 31, when the cryptocurrency traded above $150.00.
 
 
This comes as the 10-day (red) moving average nears a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Additionally, the RSI has also moved to a 16-day high, and is tracking at 65.85, which is near a ceiling of 66.00.
 
Should price strength pass this hurdle, then BCH bulls will likely recapture the $150.00 mark.

                              <span>The broken incentives driven by fiat money props up large corporations, keeping workers unproductive and stifling entrepreneurial innovation.
This is an opinion editorial by Jimmy Song, a Bitcoin developer, educator and entrepreneur and programmer with over 20 years of experience.
In the last essay, I covered how fiat money ruins individual incentives. The lack of savings vehicles and the availability of debt create a potent mix of terrible incentives at the individual level. Lack of savings vehicles mean that individuals have to work to keep any value they have and the availability of debt means that they can bring forward a lot of consumption.
The result is a lot of people who consume and relatively few productive people who save.
Why Companies?

The order was disclosed in a consultation paper published on Monday about its newly proposed licensing regime for cryptocurrency exchanges set to be put in place from June 2023.

                              <span>The Prague-based company has been acquiring feedback and data on the performance of their open-source prototype chip for Bitcoin hardware.
Tropic Square, a startup backed by SatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor, has been testing their new TROPIC01 chip, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.
Prototypes of the chip arrived from UMC, the Taiwanese production company, in December of 2022. Testing of the secure element chips is slated to continue throughout the first half of 2023.
 
         
         
         
        The TROPIC01 prototypes. 
    
The press release describes how “initial test results are very positive and have already shown that the chip development can continue as originally planned – to produce a second prototype next year and then, after verification, start mass serial production.”
Tropic Square’s goal with the design and production of the chip is to create an open-source security chip for usage in Bitcoin hardware. Bitcoin Magazine previously covered the announcement of the chip in August 2022, in which the Tropic Square team described how “Being open-source will allow the company to make improvements based on community and expert feedback.”
According to Tropic Square CEO Evzen Englberth, the testing “brings us substantially closer to mass production and closer to the introduction of the first transparent solution. These chips will then have the chance to fundamentally change the current security standards in the market.”
Jan Pleskač, CTO of Tropic Square, describes how “Examining and vetting the chip from every possible angle will help ensure the quality and reliability of the final product that goes out into the world.” 
The press release details the company’s plans to make the final pre-production prototypes in the coming year, then hopefully start mass production and launch their product on the market in 2025.</span>

                              <span>Kristin Smith is Executive Director of the Blockchain Association, which advocates for crypto policy in Washington D.C.—an exhausting effort that Sam Bankman-Fried was closely involved in, until he set it all on fire. Kristin tells Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott how SBF and FTX set things back, but there are still positive signs from crypto friendly voices in Congress.
