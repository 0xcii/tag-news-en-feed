Transaction Backlog Shrinks as Bitcoin Miners Face Fewer Inscriptions
 
On September 15, 2023, just over 500,000 unconfirmed bitcoin transfers lingered, awaiting miner confirmation, a decrease from the nearly 700,000 a week prior. Yet, as the curtain fell in September, the tally of unconfirmed transactions dwindled to a smidge over 153,000.

‘FTX Drainer’ Diverts $8M in Ethereum
 
Shortly after the downfall of FTX, the exchange fell victim to a cyber intrusion on November 11, 2022, parting with a substantial amount of ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens. Following a handful of transfers post-hack, the funds lay dormant for almost a year.

The move pushed the token to a two-month high, breaking out of a key resistance level in the process. Solana extended recent gains on Saturday. 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) rose by as much as 7% in today’s session, as the token climbed to a two-month peak.
 
LINK/USD raced to an intraday high of $8.21 to start the weekend, which comes a day after falling to a low of $7.69.
 
As a result of the rally, chainlink climbed to its highest level since July 22, when the price peaked at $8.37.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the move occurred after bulls orchestrated a breakout of a ceiling at $8.10.
 
This gain also pushed the relative strength index (RSI) into the overbought region, with a current reading of 74.28.
 
Bears may see this as an opportunity to trigger a price reversal, with a ceiling of 75.00 as a potential entry point.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) remained above the $20.00 level on Saturday, as the token neared a key price point.
 
Following a low of $20.06 on Friday, SOL/USD jumped to a high of $20.42 earlier in the weekend’s session.
 
This saw the cryptocurrency near a ceiling of $20.50, with bulls so far unable to force a breakout beyond this level.
 
 
Earlier gains have since edged lower as a result, with solana now trading at $20.30, with the RSI under a resistance point of its own at 56.00.
 
Price strength now sits at 55.96, with a floor of 53.00 a possible target for bears, in the event momentum continues to weaken this weekend.

                              <span>The legal counsel representing Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former boss of the now-defunct FTX exchange, has raised some questions about the government’s proposed queries during jury selection. The FTX co-founder faces a six-week trial, which will commence with a jury selection process on October 3, 2023.
 
The prosecutors and the defense counsel submitted their questions for jury selection on September 11. As Bitcoinist reported, the prosecutors challenged Sam Bankman-Fried’s proposed questions, calling it “unnecessarily intrusive.”

In the years since, his case has been a lightning rod for debates about internet freedom, drug policy, and the criminal justice system, leaving a lasting impact on the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community. 
As the years roll by, Ulbricht remains in prison, still seeking justice for what he believes was an unfair sentence.
In 2014, Ulbricht was arrested and accused of running Silk Road, a clandestine online marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell a wide range of goods, including drugs, using Bitcoin as the primary currency. His arrest was a pivotal moment in the…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin consolidated to start the weekend, as traders moved to secure gains following recent highs in the market. The global market cap was largely unchanged on Saturday, trading 0.06% lower at the time of writing. Ethereum also declined, after a one-month high on Friday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin retreated from a ten-day high on Saturday, as bulls opted to secure profits from recent gains.
 
BTC/USD slipped to a low of $26,721.76 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24-hours after peaking at $27,075.94.
 
The move comes as bulls were unable to sustain a recent breakout above a ceiling at the $27,100 level.
 
 
Zooming into the chart, a failed break of the 58.00 resistance level on the relative strength index (RSI), also contributed to the downturn.
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is now tracking at 56.24, which is marginally above a ceiling of 55.00.
 
Bulls will likely make another run towards $27,000 this weekend, despite today’s price consolidation.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) has been on a bull run this week, climbing to a one-month high during Friday’s session.
 
These gains have since been erased, with ETH/USD falling to a low of $1,657.68 earlier in the day, after hitting a high of $1,681.79 the day before.
 
The move has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average on the cusp with a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Although momentum is firmly bullish, a ceiling of 61.00 on the RSI could act as a hurdle for traders looking to take ETH towards $1,700.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 60.01, with ethereum hovering slightly below the $1,680 price region.

The victim, who remains unnamed, was based in Westport and followed advice to transfer funds out of a retirement account, intending to reinvest the money in an account supposedly linked to Kraken. However, their decision led to more than $3 million swiftly disappearing into crypto wallets they could not access.

The overall number of detentions has now reached 18 after these arrests, which the authorities have described as involving those “relatively close” to the core of the issue.
 
 
Police in Hong Kong announced the arrest of two individuals on Friday, one of whom had been using paper shredders and laundry bleach to destroy papers.
