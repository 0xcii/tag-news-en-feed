Gold Maintains Resiliency in H1
 
At press time, the price of an ounce of .999 fine gold hovers just above the $1,900 range, specifically at $1,924 per unit. Over the past 30 days, this precious metal has maintained a relatively stable position, while the first half (H1) statistics indicate a 5.4% increase against the U.S. dollar.

                              <span>On July 7, 2023, the digital asset manager Grayscale Investments published an update on three of its funds — the Digital Large Cap Fund, the Defi Fund, and the Smart Contract Fund. Although no new tokens were added to two of the funds, Grayscale revealed that it added Lido DAO’s native cryptocurrency and governance token, LDO, to the Defi Fund.
 
LDO Added to Grayscale’s Defi Fund
 
Grayscale Investments, the digital asset manager, announced its second-quarter 2023 update, which covers fund rebalancing and a new token addition to the Defi Fund. The Digital Large Cap Fund and Smart Contract Fund experienced no changes in terms of added or removed tokens.
 
Nonetheless, Grayscale disclosed in the update that it included Lido’s LDO token in the assortment of decentralized finance (defi) tokens held within the Defi Fund. The digital asset manager utilized cash proceeds to acquire the lido (LDO) token for the fund.
 
LDO holds the second-largest weight in the fund’s portfolio of coins, with uniswap (UNI) being the largest, representing 45.46% of the fund’s holdings, while LDO now accounts for 19.04%. Following UNI and LDO in terms of weight are AAVE (11.53%), MKR (10.82%), CRV (7.03%), and SNX (6.12%).
 
 
LDO ranks as the 33rd largest market capitalization out of nearly 10,000 crypto assets within the crypto economy. On Saturday, July 8, 2023, LDO increased by 2% against the U.S. dollar, but it has experienced a loss of more than 10% over the past 30 days.
 
Looking at six-month statistics, LDO is down 1%, and it remains 73% lower than the all-time high recorded on August 20, 2021. Currently, with the inclusion of LDO in the fund’s portfolio, Grayscale’s Defi Fund’s assets under management (AUM) stand at $3,144,411 as of July 7.

NFT Sales Take a Hit: Week-Over-Week Drop of 23% in the First Week of July 2023
 
Cryptoslam.io data reveals a 23.39% drop in NFT sales this week compared to the earlier week. Along with this downturn, there was a notable 96.48% decrease in NFT buyers and a 15.26% slide in the number of NFT sales. ETH-based NFT sales led the pack with 66.73% of total sales, reaching $130.77 million last week.
 
 
Despite their dominance, ETH NFT sales saw a 14.77% dip compared to the previous week. Among 22 networks, Bitcoin (BTC) ranked second in terms of sales, recording $23.37 million last week and experiencing a 34.99% slump week-over-week. Ethereum and Bitcoin were followed by Solana, BNB, and Polygon in weekly sales.
 
 
Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) emerged as the highest-selling NFT collection over the past week, generating $22.57 million in revenue and growing by 1% compared to the prior week.

                              <span>The US Securities and  
Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday (Friday) filed its response to Coinbase’s rejection of its allegations, noting that the cryptocurrency exchange “understood that  
the securities laws could apply to its conduct.” The securities watchdog added  
that Coinbase “knew which rules to consider in evaluating the legality of its  
conduct” but decided to take the risk “in the name of growing its business.”
SEC Responds to  
Coinbase’s Rejection
In early June, the SEC dragged Coinbase to court, claiming that the leading crypto exchange in the United  
States, is operating an unauthorized trading platform on which it offered 12  
crypto tokens that are unregistered securities. It further alleged that  
Coinbase runs an illegal crypto-staking service.

                              <span>Solana extended recent gains on Saturday, as the token rose for a third straight session to start the weekend. Today’s move came following a breakout of a key price level, despite the global crypto market cap consolidating. Avalanche also rallied, climbing by as much as 10%.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was a notable gainer in the crypto market for a third straight day, with today’s move taking price to an eight-week high.
 
Following a low of $20.19 on Friday, SOL/USD jumped to an intraday peak of $22.40 to start the weekend.
 
As a result of the surge, solana raced past a ceiling of $22.00, hitting its highest point since May 6 in the process.
 
 
From the chart, the move occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped beyond a ceiling at the 69.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 70.70, with the next visible point of resistance at 75.00.
 
Should the index reach this point, there is a good chance that SOL will climb to $23.00.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
Another notable gainer on Saturday was avalanche (AVAX), which rose by nearly 10% in today’s session.
 
AVAX/USD climbed to a high of $13.85 earlier in today’s session, a day after trading at a low of $12.60.
 
The move resulted in avalanche jumping to its strongest level since June 9, after breaking out of a resistance level of $13.50.
 
 
One of the catalysts of this rally was the 14-day RSI breaking out of its own ceiling at the 57.00 mark.
 
The index is now tracking at 58.73, and looks to be making strides for a higher point of resistance at 62.00.
 
Additionally, the 10-day (red) moving average has just avoided a downward crossover, with momentum once again shifting upward.
