Most importantly, these large whales more than doubled their volume in 24 hours, which could have serious implications for the SHIB price. As the Shiba Inu price is falling, the rise in the whale activity could suggest that these large holders are the ones spearheading the sell-offs.
 
Shiba Inu Whale Volumes Up By 117%
 
IntoTheBlock data has shown a notable uptick in the Shiba Inu whale volume recently. The timeframe of interest here is between October 6 and 7 when the whale volume shot up more than 2x.

Currently in hospice care at a senior facility in Las Vegas due to declining health, Kagel will serve his probation at the facility. Should his health improve, he must wear a monitoring device if allowed to leave.

                              <span>NFTs dominated headlines from late 2020 throughout 2021 before peaking in early 2022. By November 2020, the global NFT sales volume was around $8 million. 
 
NFT Market Down 92% From January 2022 Peaks: Best Time To Invest?
 
However, roughly 13 months later, this had grown to over $6 billion. The rapid growth was pumped partly by the excess market liquidity due to record low interest rates. Due to the accommodative policy, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and even the BNB Chain ecosystems grew.
 
 
Fast forward two years later, and NFTs are in shambles and struggling. Throughout 2022 and 2023, the trajectory has been downward, looking at CryptoSlam data. When writing on October 9, the global sale volume for all NFTs was around $100 million in early October.

                              <span>The new HBO documentary “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery,” which aired on October 8, has ignited intense debate within the crypto community. The film suggests that Canadian Bitcoin developer Peter Todd is Satoshi Nakamoto. However, Todd himself has publicly denied this identification.
 
In response to the documentary’s claims, several experts have come forward to debunk the theory proposed by director Cullen Hoback, who based his conclusion on four arguments, as reported by Bitcoinist earlier today. Among those refuting the claim is Billy Markus, co-founder of Dogecoin and known online as Shibetoshi Nakamoto. Taking to X, Markus stated, “It’s not Peter Todd bro.”

Reaching this critical junction comes on the heels of interesting price action in the past seven days, which saw the meme coin break above and immediately crash in less than 24 hours.
 
Now, the BONK price is consolidating after reaching a support. According to crypto analyst World Of Charts, this consolidation phase is generating the momentum needed for a potential breakout, with the next move likely to push prices higher.
