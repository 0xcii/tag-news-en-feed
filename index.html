The Salvadoran vice president Felix Ulloa linked the positive developments in the country’s economy and the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender back in 2021, under the guidance of Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele.

Bitcoin ETF Set To Transform BTC Market
 
According to the analyst, the spot Bitcoin ETF proposal filed by asset manager BlackRock will inevitably get approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As its CEO shows, the asset manager is betting on this launch.

Stakers were being rewarded handsomely for committing their ETH tokens to help secure the network, prompting a rapid rise in the percentage of ETH supply staked. However, there has been a sharp decline in the APY which has raised the question of whether it is still worth it to stake ETH.
 
Ethereum Staking APY Falls To 3.5%
 
In an interesting turn of events, the yearly APY that is being paid to Ethereum stakers has dropped to 3.5%. This was the case on the last reward day which took place on Sunday, October 15, and as the BeaconChain website points out, stakers are now receiving 3.502% rewards per annum.

Study Indicates Crypto Winter Recovery as Long-term Holders Give Way to Short-term Speculators
 

 
A recent report by the onchain analytics firm Glassnode examines how bitcoin (BTC) changes hands between investors over time. The study tracks the ebb and flow of coins moving from long-term holders who accumulated bitcoin during the bear market, to short-term speculators trying to profit on price swings.
 

 
Glassnode utilizes a metric called “realized capital” to measure the total amount paid historically to acquire all existing bitcoins. This offers a view into when coins last moved between investors. Glassn…</span>

This move effectively transitions Binance.US into a crypto-only exchange, restricting the deposit and withdrawal of fiat currency. In early June, Binance.US suspended dollar deposits following the SEC’s request to freeze its assets.

Cheng, who co-founded Mysten Labs, the creator of the innovative Layer 1 blockchain Sui, believes that the recent slowdown in crypto investments following the hype-driven bull run will soon give way to a more strategic and cautious approach.
 
Cheng expressed optimism about the growing interest of traditional financial institutions in the crypto and blockchain space. He envisions a more mature and merit-based environment emerging as a result of this interest.
