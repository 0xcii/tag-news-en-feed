                              <span>PayPal, the renowned finance tech platform, has plans to roll out cryptocurrency services in Luxembourg. This move is an attempt to expand crypto services in the European Union. PayPal is headquartered in Luxembourg, which could prove to be an entryway for the other 26 countries in the bloc.
 
This could happen if the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is passed and goes into effect. If this happens, PayPal will permit customers in Luxembourg to buy, sell, and hold digital currencies.
 
The proposed MiCA regulation will allow firms registered in any member state to get a license to offer services all across the EU. This process has been termed “passporting.”
 
Jose Fernandez da Ponte, SVP and GM, of blockchain, and digital currencies at PayPal, at the time, said;

                              <span>Last month, the provincial energy regulator was asked to reallocate 270 megawatts that was set aside for cryptocurrency mining.
The Québec government’s utility company, Hydro-Québec, has requested the reallocation of 270 megawatts of energy set aside for cryptocurrency mining, once again signaling another Canadian government entity’s desire to curtail or modify bitcoin mining in the country. As of December of 2021, Canada had 6.48% of global hash rate according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.
A Bitcoin Magazine article from 2021 details the various regulatory challenges in Canada, as well as the successful operations that continue to prosper in the country despite these. Recently, the Manitoba province’s government set an 18-month moratorium on new mining operations. In the past, Canada has experienced large influxes of miners seeking to take advantage of the abundance of power there. 
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, “Hydro-Québec charges the lowest rates for industrial power in North America, with average prices as of April 1 of 3.93 cents per kilowatt-hour… The average cost in North America is 8.22 cents, according to Hydro-Québec.”

The request is up for approval by Québec’s energy regulator, Régie de l’énergie du Québec, which is believed to be completed within the next few months. The move would not restrict power to existing firms within the province, but could impact future development and investment into the region. 
Bitcoin miners’ ability to move their equipment does make it possible for operations to shift out of the region to more friendly locations such as Texas or Wyoming, which could become prime examples of the power of favorable regulation. This has been demonstrated before, most dramatically with the hash rate migration out of China after their bitcoin mining ban.</span>

One specific investment made by FTX Ventures Ltd. was for $25 million into the Ohio-based firm 80 Acres, a company that specializes in vertical farming. It seems that 80 Acres Farms was partnered with a Bahamian hydroponic producer called Eeden Farms, and Ryan Salame, the co-chief executive officer of FTX Digital Markets, toured 80 Acres farm in Ohio with the Bahamian prime minister Philip Davis.

                              <span>Investor Kevin “Mr. Wonderful” O’Leary gave more details about his participation in failed crypto exchange FTX and his insight on its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). The crypto trading venue lost billions of its customers’ funds, including O’Leary and other prominent investment firms. 
 
 
In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, Mr. Wonderful talked about his transition from a crypto detractor to a defender. He claimed the global crypto regulatory environment shifted him to embrace the nascent asset class. 
 
“Mr. Wonderful” went from classifying Bitcoin and crypto as “garbage” to investing millions in digital assets. This investment turned to ashes as FTX collapsed and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. A process that is still ongoing.

                              <span>Litecoin fell for a third consecutive session on Thursday, as the token continued to move away from recent highs. Cryptocurrencies have been mostly lower in recent days, as traders continue to fear a global recession. Cosmos also remained in the red during today’s session. 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) dropped to a ten-day low on Thursday, with the token falling for a third straight session.
 
Following a high of $79.20 on Wednesday, LTC/USD moved to a low of $74.82 earlier in the day’s session.
 
As a result of this, the token fell to its lowest point since November 29, when prices hit a bottom of $73.39.
 
 
Looking at the chart, it appears that litecoin bears are hoping to push prices towards a floor at $73.00.
 
This seems a possibility, especially with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fast approaching a floor of its own.
 
The index is currently tracking at 57.10, and seems to be moving towards a support point of 53.00.
 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Another notable token on Thursday has been cosmos (ATOM), which fell to a ten-day low earlier in the day.
 
ATOM/USD fell to a bottom of $9.52 on Thursday, before bulls reentered the market and bought the recent dip.
 
Today’s bottom saw cosmos trade at its lowest level since November 28, which was the last time the token hit its floor at $9.45.
 
 
As of writing, ATOM has mostly rebounded, and is currently trading at the $9.71 level.
 
In addition to this, the RSI has bounced from a floor of its own at 39.50, and is currently tracking at 41.40.
 
Should momentum continue in an upward direction, ATOM bulls will likely target a move above the $10.00 mark.
