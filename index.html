New York Investors To Receive $16.7 Million In KuCoin Settlement
 
According to a Bloomberg report, KuCoin will refund a total of $16.7 million to approximately 177,800 New York investors under the settlement terms. In addition, the exchange will pay a $5.3 million fine to the state, as announced by New York Attorney General (NYAG) Letitia James. 
 
The settlement results from allegations that KuCoin failed to register as a securities and commodities broker-dealer while “falsely” presenting itself as a cryptocurrency exchange.

Elizabeth Warren’s Crypto Bill Gains More Support

Bitcoin Investors With More Than 1,000 BTC Have Grown In Number Recently
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, BTC whales might be capitalizing on the current lower asset prices to accumulate. The relevant indicator here is the total number of Bitcoin entities carrying a balance of at least 1,000 BTC.
 
As for what an “entity” constitutes, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode says, “entities are defined as a cluster of addresses that are controlled by the same network entity and are estimated through advanced heuristics and Glassnode’s proprietary clustering algorithms.”

The nation’s Volcano Bond, integral to its plan to establish the world’s first Bitcoin city, has received regulatory approval from the Digital Assets Commission (CNAD).
 
This development was confirmed by President Nayib Bukele in a post on social media, signaling a major step forward in the country’s crypto-centric vision.

This settlement arises from Kucoin’s alleged failure to register as a securities and commodities broker-dealer and its misrepresentation as a crypto exchange. 
 
New York AG Clinches Settlement From Kucoin Over Registration Lapses
 
On Tuesday, the consent order applied by James mandates that Kucoin refund over 150,000 New York investors more than $16.7 million and pay an additional $5.3 million to the state. Attorney General James emphasized the reported risks associated with unregistered offshore crypto platforms to investors, consumers, and the broader economy.

Polygon Gearing Up For Bullish Breakout
 
Crypto analyst Ali Martinez points out that the Polygon price is looking toward breaking a significant resistance. Mainly, such a breakout would be the catalyst for the expected price surge which could trigger a 100% price increase.
