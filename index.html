                              <span>The cryptocurrency industry is abuzz with reports of potential turmoil within the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) crypto assets and cyber unit. Senior lawyers are reportedly considering departures, raising questions about leadership and the agency’s approach to regulating the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.
 
 
Exodus Or Evolution?
 
Fox Business journalist Charles Gasparino first reported the potential exodus, citing sources from major law firms who observed an uptick in resumes from within the SEC’s crypto unit. This follows allegations of Chairman Gary Gensler attempting to “gag” crypto firms, casting a shadow over his leadership style and decisions.
