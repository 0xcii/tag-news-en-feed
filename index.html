Pro-Bitcoin politician Sitiveni Rabuka recently took office as the new Prime Minister of the Pacific Islands of Fiji. Now, it seems the new PM is actively considering the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender there.
While Rabuka himself hasn’t been very public about his opinions on Bitcoin thus far, Lord Fusitu&#x27;a, a noble and former member of parliament of neighboring nation Tonga, has reportedly confirmed that the Fijian politician is a bitcoin bull.
&quot;The new PM is definitely pro-Bitcoin,&quot; Lord Fusitu&#x27;a assured Cointelegraph.
Lord Fusitu&#x27;a also shared the news on Twitter.

This is an opinion editorial by Dillon Healy, a member of the institutional partnerships team at Bitcoin Magazine and The Bitcoin Conference.
A topic that has received increased attention lately is the concern around Bitcoin’s future “security budget.”

Bitcoin miners play a crucial part in securing the network by proposing blocks of transactions which nodes then verify, accept and update to the Bitcoin ledger. Competing against other miners to propose this new block to the chain, miners use intense computing power to com…</span>

Despite the fact that various industry leaders have called for clear laws and guidance for regulated progress, the agency led by Gary Gensler refuses to act.

Sam Bankman-Fried is under house arrest.

Now that he’s home, that doesn’t mean people can just drop by anytime for coffee or chat. The road leading up to his parents house has been closed down from the public.
