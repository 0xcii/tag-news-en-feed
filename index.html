Cardano Can Not Advertise Like Solana
 
The famous crypto founder shared his insights on the claims on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Hoskinson’s X post came in response to an ADA enthusiast, Bradford Rich’s post criticizing the Cardano team and founder for not running ads like Solana to increase the network’s adoption.
 
 
In the X post, Rich dished out a screenshot of a recent Solana advertisement garnering attention from the crypto community. The purpose of the commercial, which describes Solana’s rising traction over time, was to draw additional developers to utilize the proof-of-sca…</span>

U.S. Forfeiture Division Aims to Sell 2,933.64 Bitcoins
 
In a recent public announcement, the U.S. government’s forfeiture division declared its intention to “dispose” of bitcoins confiscated from Ryan Farace and Sean Bridges. The federal agents secured a total of 2,874.90 BTC from both individuals and an additional 58.74 BTC exclusively from Farace.

Filan stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the court had granted Ripple’s motion to file a Sur-reply, meaning that the crypto firm can now file an additional reply to the SEC’s motion. The Commission had initially filed a motion to compel Ripple to produce certain documents. The crypto firm then filed a response arguing why the court should not grant this motion.

                              <span>After dipping below $38,000 earlier this week, Bitcoin has staged a mini-comeback, currently trading around $40,100. This flicker of green has ignited contrasting viewpoints from market watchers, including CNBC’s Jim Cramer, whose recent advice has raised eyebrows.
 
Cramer, known for his sometimes contrarian takes, has taken a cautious stance on Bitcoin’s recent rally. While acknowledging the positive momentum, he expressed concerns about the cryptocurrency’s ability to sustain this upward climb due to potential lack of fresh capital entering the market.

The financial giant’s analysis focuses on the dynamics involving the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States.
 
JP Morgan Foresees End Of Selling Pressure
 
The report acknowledges the recent 20% correction in BTC’s price over the past two weeks, attributing it largely to profit-taking on previous GBTC investments. JP Morgan analysts note, “Profit-taking on GBTC’s ‘discount to NAV trade’ has likely been a major driver behind Bitcoin’s correction; $4.3 billion has thus far exited GBTC since its conversion to ETF.”

                              <span>The cryptocurrency  
exchange Bitget has enhanced the security of its platform wallets through an  
upgrade to Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology. MPC aims to boost wallet  
protections using distributed computing, homomorphic encryption, and a Trusted  
Execution Environment (TEE).
Bitget Upgrades Wallets  
with Advanced Security Technology
The  
technology implemented by Bitget works by dividing private keys into segments  
across multiple servers. Transactions can then occur without keys being  
revealed in one place. TEE also provides hardware-level security to fortify the  
wallet infrastructure. The upgrade  
follows Bitget&#x27;s ongoing efforts to implement new security solutions. The  
company previously launched  
an MPC-enhanced wallet to protect users&#x27; digital assets.
