Unilateral Conversion of Users’ Funds
 
The Nigeria crypto exchange platform Patricia has reportedly raised an undisclosed amount of capital to fund its reimbursement plan for users affected by the May hacking. The crypto exchange’s reported capital raise came just a few weeks after it unilaterally converted user funds to a stablecoin token known as patricia token.

                              <span>Crypto lender Blockfi is moving closer to returning funds to clients after a bankruptcy judge confirmed its Chapter 11 plan on Tuesday. The plan outlines a process for the company to distribute the remaining assets to clients and attempt to recover additional funds. 
 
Blockfi Advances on Client Asset Reimbursement Following Chapter 11 Plan Approval
 
With over 90% of voting creditors approving the plan, Blockfi expressed optimism about providing client recoveries relatively quickly compared to similar crypto bankruptcies. The plan confirmation comes after Blockfi originally filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022, amid the broader crypto market downturn.
 
Under the approved plan, Blockfi will first distribute the remaining digital assets back to clients with funds in Blockfi Wallet accounts. The company will then make an initial distribution to clients with funds in Blockfi Interest Accounts (BIAs) and retail crypto-backed loans.
 
“Over the coming months, you will receive an email prompting you to withdraw your funds based on the recovery amounts approved by the plan,” Blockfi told BIA and loan clients in a blog post. The firm expects wallet withdrawals to conclude before distributions to other clients begin.
 
 
Additional distributions to clients will depend on Blockfi’s success in recovering funds from the FTX bankruptcy case. Blockfi claims FTX owes it money and intends to pursue litigation to obtain those assets. Any funds recouped from FTX could increase client payouts.
 
Before distributions can formally start, a Bermuda court overseeing Blockfis international clients must recognize the U.S. bankruptcy court’s plan approval. Once finalized, Blockfi can emerge from bankruptcy and enact the wind-down process outlined in the plan.

                              <span>Chainlink rose for a fourth straight day to start the weekend, as the price surged by as much as 7% in today’s session. The move pushed the token to a two-month high, breaking out of a key resistance level in the process. Solana extended recent gains on Saturday. 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) rose by as much as 7% in today’s session, as the token climbed to a two-month peak.
 
LINK/USD raced to an intraday high of $8.21 to start the weekend, which comes a day after falling to a low of $7.69.
 
As a result of the rally, chainlink climbed to its highest level since July 22, when the price peaked at $8.37.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the move occurred after bulls orchestrated a breakout of a ceiling at $8.10.
 
This gain also pushed the relative strength index (RSI) into the overbought region, with a current reading of 74.28.
 
Bears may see this as an opportunity to trigger a price reversal, with a ceiling of 75.00 as a potential entry point.
 
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) remained above the $20.00 level on Saturday, as the token neared a key price point.
 
Following a low of $20.06 on Friday, SOL/USD jumped to a high of $20.42 earlier in the weekend’s session.
 
This saw the cryptocurrency near a ceiling of $20.50, with bulls so far unable to force a breakout beyond this level.
 
 
Earlier gains have since edged lower as a result, with solana now trading at $20.30, with the RSI under a resistance point of its own at 56.00.
 
Price strength now sits at 55.96, with a floor of 53.00 a possible target for bears, in the event momentum continues to weaken this weekend.

The FTX co-founder faces a six-week trial, which will commence with a jury selection process on October 3, 2023.
 
The prosecutors and the defense counsel submitted their questions for jury selection on September 11. As Bitcoinist reported, the prosecutors challenged Sam Bankman-Fried’s proposed questions, calling it “unnecessarily intrusive.”

In the years since, his case has been a lightning rod for debates about internet freedom, drug policy, and the criminal justice system, leaving a lasting impact on the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community. 
As the years roll by, Ulbricht remains in prison, still seeking justice for what he believes was an unfair sentence.
In 2014, Ulbricht was arrested and accused of running Silk Road, a clandestine online marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell a wide range of goods, including drugs, using Bitcoin as the primary currency. His arrest was a pivotal moment in the…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin consolidated to start the weekend, as traders moved to secure gains following recent highs in the market. The global market cap was largely unchanged on Saturday, trading 0.06% lower at the time of writing. Ethereum also declined, after a one-month high on Friday.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin retreated from a ten-day high on Saturday, as bulls opted to secure profits from recent gains.
 
BTC/USD slipped to a low of $26,721.76 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24-hours after peaking at $27,075.94.
 
The move comes as bulls were unable to sustain a recent breakout above a ceiling at the $27,100 level.
 
 
Zooming into the chart, a failed break of the 58.00 resistance level on the relative strength index (RSI), also contributed to the downturn.
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is now tracking at 56.24, which is marginally above a ceiling of 55.00.
 
Bulls will likely make another run towards $27,000 this weekend, despite today’s price consolidation.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) has been on a bull run this week, climbing to a one-month high during Friday’s session.
 
These gains have since been erased, with ETH/USD falling to a low of $1,657.68 earlier in the day, after hitting a high of $1,681.79 the day before.
 
The move has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average on the cusp with a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
 
Although momentum is firmly bullish, a ceiling of 61.00 on the RSI could act as a hurdle for traders looking to take ETH towards $1,700.
 
Currently, the index is tracking at 60.01, with ethereum hovering slightly below the $1,680 price region.

A recent case serves as a vivid reminder of the risks involved, where a Connecticut resident became a victim of a significant scam, losing more than $3 million to individuals falsely purporting to be associated with Kraken, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange.
 
The victim, who remains unnamed, was based in Westport and followed advice to transfer funds out of a retirement account, intending to reinvest the money in an account supposedly linked to Kraken. However, their decision led to more than $3 million swiftly disappearing into crypto wallets they could not access.
