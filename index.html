                              <span>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has responded to what seems to be a deliberate exclusion of the network from one of the biggest crypto reports of the year. The Messari seventh annual crypto report titled “Crypto Theses for 2024” is a 200-page report covering a range of topics from Layer 1 blockchains to decentralized finance (DeFi), among other things. However, the Cardano community was quick to notice that the network was not mentioned and has taken to social media to demand answers.
 
Cardano Founder Responds To Messari’s Omission
 
Following the release of the Messari crypto report, one community member took to X (formerly Twitter) to call out the platform for omitting Cardan. In the post, @StakeWithPride points out each blockchain and how many times they were mentioned in the article…</span>

                              <span>Phantom, the Web3 cryptocurrency wallet initially developed for Solana, has expanded to include Ethereum and Polygon, and is now introducing support for Bitcoin, Ordinal inscriptions, and BRC20 tokens. Users of Phantom have the ability to integrate their existing bitcoin wallets, allowing them to manage their Bitcoin-centric digital collectibles and fungible tokens through the Web3 platform’s interface.
 
From Solana to Bitcoin: Phantom Wallet’s Latest Expansion Embraces Inscriptions and BRC20s
 
In 2023, Ordinals and BRC20 tokens, developed atop Bitcoin, have gained considerable traction, leading numerous companies to adopt the supporting infrastructure. As of December 21, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain boasts over 50 million inscriptions.
 
On Wednesday, Phantom, the Web3 wallet that secured $109 million in Series B funding from key investors last year, announced its foray into the Bitcoin realm. Phantom acknowledges Bitcoin’s foundational role, stating that without it, there would be no Solana, Ethereum, or Web3.
 
“Introducing Bitcoin on Phantom,” the company said in a post shared on X. “You can now buy, sell, trade, transfer, and HODL Bitcoin, Ordinals, and BRC20 tokens with your favorite multi-chain wallet.”
 
 
Phantom’s integration of Ordinals and BRC20s coincides with a surge in demand for Bitcoin digital collectibles and fungible tokens. Recent data from cryptoslam.io reveals that Bitcoin-based NFT sales have exceeded $400 million in the past week.
 
Phantom’s Bitcoin feature is currently in beta and available on an opt-in basis. Users can also link with the NFT marketplaces Magic Eden and Unisat, and Phantom indicates that additional “trusted” applications will be introduced shortly.

The MEXC exchange funded this entire giveaway, as they went against Grimace’s user base and listed the token on their futures market without approval.
 
The Start of It All: The Complete Story of the Dispute
 
In spring 2023, Grimace emerged as one of the year’s standout crypto projects, quickly gaining fame and enriching its early backers, who were also actively donating to charity. Money was freely given away on the streets, and competitions in poker, chess, Dota 2, Counter-Strike, and even rap battles were held, each with prizes in the tens of thousands of dollars.
 
Grimace first appeared on MEXC on June 12, 2023. Initially, users appreciated the exchange for it…</span>

                              <span>In a groundbreaking statement, Argentina&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Diana Mondino, has confirmed the country&#x27;s stance on embracing Bitcoin for contractual agreements.



Mondino&#x27;s declaration outlined the government&#x27;s willingness to accept and formalize contracts denominated in Bitcoin, heralding a pivotal moment for legal recognition of BTC within Argentina. The move demonstrates Argentina&#x27;s progressive approach towards integrating Bitcoin in the country.
&quot;And also any other crypto and/or species such as kilos of steer or liters of milk,&quot; Mondino continued. &quot;Art 766. - Obligation of the debtor. The debtor must deliver the corresponding amount of the designated currency, whether the currency is legal tender in the Republic or not.&quot;
This announcement arrives a month after Javier Milei, who has made very positive comments about Bitcoin in the past, won Argentina&#x27;s presidential candidacy. Milei has previously stated, &quot;The central bank is a scam, a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax.” Then saying Bitcoin &quot;represents the return of money to its original creator, the private sector,” and that &quot;it prevents politicians from robbing you through inflation.&quot;
The Minister&#x27;s assertion further underlines Argentina&#x27;s efforts to leverage the potential of Bitcoin to stimulate economic growth and innovation. By accepting Bitcoin as a valid form of contractual agreement, the government aims to foster an environment conducive to investment and business development within the country.
While the details regarding the implementation and legal nuances remain to be outlined, Mondino&#x27;s statement marks a crucial step forward in legitimizing Bitcoin as a recognized means of conducting formal agreements within Argentina. The move may also serve as a catalyst, encouraging other nations to consider similar initiatives in integrating Bitcoin into their legal frameworks.</span>

Ripple Transfers Massive XRP Tokens To Exchanges
 
According to reports from on-chain crypto tracker Whale Alert, the firm recently performed three massive transfers of XRP. The tracker took to X (formerly Twitter) to alert the crypto community about the whale transfer as each one was made.
 
 
The massive XRP transfer coincides with the cryptocurrency’s significant comeback, following nearly two days of bearish decline. The first transfer which is the biggest saw about 120,000,000 XRP moved, valued at $73,838,616 as of the time of the transfer.

The freeze

demise last year, amid a broader crypto market rout.
According  
to liquidator Teneo, the freeze order was issued by a British Virgin Islands

As Scottish economist and philosopher David Hume observed in A Treatise of Human Nature, nothing we know about what is true can tell us what ought to be true and nothing we know about what ought to be true can tell us what is true. The world of objective fact and moral truth are entirely separate. Hume called this the is/ought problem and his argument that descriptive and normative reasoning should be separated is known as Hume’s guillotine. 
Hume’s guillotine is a philosophical razor – a rule of thumb for reasoning about the world. It is a way of cutting apart two lines of reasoning that become entangled when they intertwine. An argument where one side argues about what is true and the other side argues about what ought to be true is a useless argument. Thos…</span>

Bitcoin 4-Year Cycles Have Followed An Interesting Pattern
 
In a new post on X, cycle analyst Root has shared a Bitcoin chart that breaks down the phases that the cryptocurrency’s price has gone through over the different 4-year cycles.
 
In order to separate between bullish and bearish periods, the analyst has made use of an on-chain indicator called the “short-term holder cost basis.” Now, what do these terms mean?
 
 
First, the short-term holders (STHs) refer to the fickle-minded side of the BTC market who buy and sell often. Typically, the investors who bought within the last six months are included in this cohort.
