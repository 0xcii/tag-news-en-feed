                              <span>The rising adoption of digital assets has resulted in multiple countries adding support for digital currencies. Earlier today, China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), announced the continued expansion of the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan.
 
The digital currency is currently undergoing a pilot program expanded to 17 more provinces across China. The country’s central bank said it is focusing on launching a system allowing consumers to “scan with one code.” The report noted:

                              <span>On Monday, 30 January, crypto YouTuber Jeff at OnTheChain.io revealed on Twitter the number of years it might take Shiba Inu to reduce its supply to 100 billion tokens.
 
The crypto analyst identified that Shiba Inu has a quadrillion tokens. He said if the crypto were to burn 1 million tokens per day, then it would take about 1,157,174 years to reduce its entire supply to 100 billion tokens.
 
Meanwhile, $XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan commented on Jeff’s tweet by saying that “so, you’re saying it’s possible.” In other words, his comment appears to mean that it would be impossible and unrealistic for the crypto to take those years to burn its tokens to about 100 billion tokens.

                              <span>Elon Musk’s Twitter is preparing to add payments functionality that could potentially include cryptocurrency, inside sources told the Financial Times.

Twitter is prepping for payments, and bitcoin might be in the mix.
According to a Financial Times report, Elon is open to adding BTC and crypto to its Twitter payments vision.
While the “super app” vision would prioritize fiat, its future will likely include the alternative payment method.

Elon Musks’ Twitter has reportedly begun applying for regulatory licenses across the U.S. in apparent preparation to begin facilitating payments through the app.
People close to the company stated that Twitter “has started to map out the architecture needed to facilitate payments on the platform with a small team,” which could potentially include functionality for cryptocurrency payments, the Financial Times reported. 
According to the FT source, Musk has stated that he wants Twitter to serve fiat payments first, but be made with the ability to enable cryptocurrency later on. This would not be the first time that Elon Musks’ businesses have facilitated bitcoin transactions. Musk has previously accepted bitcoin for his Tesla electric vehicles, but later retracted the ability due to concerns about renewable energy. 
While there are no firm plans to implement this interoperability, Musk has firmly reiterated since his taking over of the social media firm that he wants to see it become more of a generalized “super app.” This multifunctionality approach would benefit greatly from the increased functionality of cheap, instantaneous payments using a platform like the Bitcoin Lightning Network.
Twitter previously tested “tipping” through the Bitcoin Lightning Network via Jack Mallers’ Strike, later adding the ability for users to add a Bitcoin address to directly receive their tips.</span>

                              <span>The crypto industry may be facing a major setback as the Federal Reserve (FED) appears to be losing control of the markets. This new status quo could lead to even more hawkish measures impacting the traditional and cryptocurrency markets. 
 
 
A report released on January 29 by Michael J. Kramer – founder of Mott Capital, suggests that the FED needs to “push back against the market before it’s too late.” Since the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, financial conditions have eased dramatically. 
 
This easing of financial conditions has led to a rise in commodity prices, a drop in mortgage rates, a weakening dollar, and a rally in stocks and significant crypto assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. 
 
According to Kramer, the February Federal Open Market Commit…</span>

                              <span>The new bitcoin and crypto-backed prepaid Binance Card is coming to Brazil, one of the exchange’s largest markets.
Mastercard and Binance have announced the launch of a bitcoin and crypto backed prepaid card in Brazil, Latin America&#x27;s largest economy. 
According to a blog post, the Binance Card is currently in beta testing and is expected to be widely available in the country in the next few weeks. The Binance Card is currently already available in many European countries. 
The Brazilian version will &quot;allow all new and existing Binance users in Brazil with a valid national ID to make purchases and pay bills with cryptocurrencies.&quot; It will charge a 0.9% fee per transaction involving bitcoin, according to the blog, and there will be an offered 8% in cashback on select purchases, while allowing ATM withdrawals without fees.
Brazil is one of the company’s top 10 markets, according to Binance, and the card will allow new and existing users in the country to pay bills and shop with cryptocurrencies at Mastercard merchants. The launch of the prepaid card is part of Binance&#x27;s effort to &quot;broaden the connection between traditional finance and crypto.&quot; The card has already been launched in Argentina and is being rolled out in Brazil next. 
Brazil is one of the largest potential markets in the world, simply by the numbers alone. According to estimates, over 10 million of the country&#x27;s population of approximately 214 million utilize cryptocurrency. Brazil has also experienced high inflation rates since the start of the pandemic similar to the United States, leaving citizens with an appetite for sound money.</span>
