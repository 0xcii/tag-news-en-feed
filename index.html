                              <span>Pepe (PEPE) has observed a plunge of 15% in the last few days, which has led to Litecoin (LTC) overtaking the memecoin in terms of market cap.
 
PEPE Has Ended Its Recent Bullish Run With A Drawdown Of 15%
 
PEPE was having an excellent May as its price was on a steep upwards trajectory, but the asset has slipped up in these last few days of the month as it has gone through a drawdown.
 
 
The below chart shows how the memecoin’s performance has looked like over the past month.
 

 
 
PEPE had kicked off the month trading around $0.0000061 and by the start of this week, the cryptocurrency had nearly tripled its value as it breached the $0.0000170 mark.
 
Since this peak on Monday, though, the frog-themed coin has suffered a notable drop. At present, the coin is trading around 0.0000143, im…</span>

Get Ready For FLOKI Breakout
 
Crypto analyst Blunts had first taken to X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday to talk about FLOKI and the prospects for the meme coin. Initially, he had compared FLOKI to PEPE, another Ethereum-based meme coin that outperformed top coins in the market in May. Apparently, FLOKI’s price trend was similar to that of PEPE and he expects it to follow the same path.
