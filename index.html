Solana Has Observed A Fresh Rally During The Past Day
 
While Bitcoin has gone stale in the last few days, some altcoins have taken the front seat as they have registered some sharp bullish momentum. Among these decoupled assets is also Solana, which has really blasted off in the past day.
 
During the last 24 hours, SOL has observed a rally of more than 14%, reaching the $73 level for the first time since early May, as the chart below shows.
 

 
 
SOL’s performance during the past day has been the second strongest among the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap, with only Cardano (ADA) coming up with better returns.
