                              <span>In the last year, many have claimed the crypto industry is under attack by U.S. regulators and recent data supports this perception. The agencies in this country shattered all previous records, since 2013, in terms of legal actions against companies in the nascent space.

                              <span>Dogecoin climbed to an eight-week high on Jan. 31, as prices broke out of a key resistance level on Tuesday. The meme coin surged ahead following the release of the latest consumer confidence report in the United States. Shiba inu also moved higher, rebounding from losses to start the week.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) raced higher on Tuesday, as the meme coin broke out of a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $0.08578 to start the week, DOGE/USD rose to an intraday high of $0.095 earlier today.
 
As a result of the surge, dogecoin rose to its strongest point since December 11, when prices were at a high of $0.0972.
 
 
Since the move, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a ceiling of its own.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 65.03, which is marginally above a resistance level at 65.00.
 
Providing bulls are able to maintain current momentum, their next target will likely be $0.099.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Another notable mover was shiba inu (SHIB), which rebounded following losses to start the week.
 
SHIB/USD rose to a high of $0.00001195 in today’s session, which comes a day after the token was at a low of $0.00001134.
 
Tuesday’s surge saw SHIB climb back above a key support level of $0.00001165, and came as the RSI also rebounded.
 
 
As of writing, the index is currently tracking at 62.57, which is marginally above a floor at 60.00.
 
Should momentum continue to move higher, the next target for shiba inu bulls will likely be a ceiling at 68.00
 
Providing this mark is hit, it is a strong possibility that SHIB/USD will be trading above $0.00001220.

                              <span>Significant crises and unpleasant events negatively impacted Bitcoin and other crypto asset prices in 2022. Some notable events include the collapse of Terra and its ecosystem, the implosion of the FTX exchange, and the spreading of contagions that followed them.
 
However, early 2023 brought a new dawn in the industry. Most crypto tokens rose in value, with Bitcoin closing the market at $23K from January 25 till the 30th. 
 
 
But amid the price recovery, the tension of the 2022 bear market is still lingering. As a result, some employees in the industry are losing their jobs. According to a recent report, almost 3,000 crypto employees lost their jobs in January 2023.

We need work and work needs us.
Labor is what takes a harsh, brutist and difficult world and turns it into a livable, enjoyable and even meaningful place. Work is how we contribute to our civilization, our communities and, of course, our families. Work in a normal, functioning market provides value.
Work, in a very real sense, is what we contribute to civilization. The output of our labor is a legacy we leave behind. Our collective work is what builds everything around us, from the buildings we live in, to the roads…</span>

You could argue that rather than narratives, crypto needs concrete real-world utility, but still, when sentiment picks up and bullishness stirs for certain, the reality, whether we like it or not, is that narratives have a gravitational effect on incoming traders.
