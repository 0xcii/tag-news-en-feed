                              <span>There have been numerous XRP price predictions from crypto analysts, but this time around, a machine-learning algorithm has predicted the future price of the altcoin. While the bullishness of the prediction is not exactly a surprise, the time frame that the algorithm gives for XRP to reach 40% is particularly interesting.
 
XRP Price To Make A 40% Jump To $0.8
 
The CoinCodex machine learning algorithm takes into account the previous XRP price performances and uses this to predict the future price. The predictions span a number of timelines but the short-term prediction (5 days) is of particular importance in this instance.

Published on a cryptography mailing list, this seminal document provided a comprehensive solution to the long-standing double-spending problem without the need for a trusted third party. 
 
A 15-Year Journey Into the Heart of Bitcoin’s Revolutionary Design
 
Today, 15 years later, we delve into the depths of Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision, exploring the revolutionary impacts of Bitcoin and how it has transformed our approach to currency, trust, and financial freedom. Nakamoto’s white paper, titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” was a radical departure from conventional financial systems. It pro…</span>

Thanksgiving and Christmas are important holidays for many and one of the best times to gather with family. Still, I would argue that one of the most important holidays is only celebrated by .01 percent of the global population.
That’s right, I am talking about Whitepaper Day. It was 15 years ago today that one of the most important documents ever written was released to the world. The importance of this document is akin to Martin Luther, who published his 95 Theses in Wittenberg, Germany, on October 31, 1517.

Bitcoin Futures Market May Be Becoming Overheated
 
As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC open interest has entered the overheat zone following the latest rally in the cryptocurrency’s price.
 
The “open interest” here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts open on all derivative exchanges in the sector. The metric naturally accounts for both short and long positions.
 
When the value of this indicator rises, it means that the investors are opening up more positions on the futures market right now. Generally, whenever this happens, the overall leverage in the market also goes up, and with leverage,…</span>

Bitcoin went through the blocksize war. A nation state has adopted Bitcoin. We are possibly on the verge of a Bitcoin ETF approval. Bitcoin in almost every way is nothing like it was described in the original whitepaper all the years ago. 
The network has grown, it has changed, it has evolved. On a social level, an economic level, and a technical level it&#x27;s a completely different animal than it was all those many years ago. I feel like on this day, every year, people tend to focus on Bitcoin as it was all the way back in 2008.

                              <span>XRP was one of the biggest gainers on Tuesday, as price rose by as much as 8% in today’s session. The surge pushed the token to its strongest level since the middle of August, and closer to a key resistance zone. Toncoin was another notable gainer, climbing by over 6% today.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was a strong gainer on Tuesday, as the token rose by as much as 8% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $0.5634 to start the week, XRP/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.6127 earlier today.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, the world’s fifth largest cryptocurrency rose to its highest level since August 15.
 
 
Today’s move saw XRP climb for a third straight day, pushing the token close to a ceiling of $0.6400.
 
From the chart, it appears that the relative strength index (RSI) has broken a resistance point of 73.00, and is now sitting at 75.08.
 
In order to reach the aforementioned resistance level, the index will likely need to reach a ceiling at or above 80.00.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was another notable gainer on Tuesday, climbing to a one-month high during the day.
 
TON/USD hit a high of $2.23 earlier in the day, which comes a day after trading at a low of $2.09.
 
Owing to the move, toncoin rose to its highest point since September 28, when price was above $2.30.
 
 
Looking at the chart, recent gains have pushed price strength above a ceiling at 59.00, and the index is now tracking at 61.62.
 
The next visible point of resistance is at the 71.00 point, and if hit, there is a good chance TON moves towards $2.60.

This time, he and his lawyers seemed solely focused on changing the narrative that had already been put forward by the prosecution, including certain correspondences between Bankman-Fried and FTX’s former Director of Engineering Nishad Singh.
 
FTX Founder Says Messages To Singh Were Misunderstood
 
According to a report by Fortune, Bankman-Fried stated that Singh misinterpreted the text exchanges between them just before FTX filed for bankruptcy. In one of the exchanges, Singh had asked SBF if he was fine with him performing some backdated trades in order to get rid of his debts, as …</span>

Layer-2
