This is an opinion editorial by Austin Herbert, a producer for “The Mark Moss Show.”

How do I know that Bitcoiners suck at orange pilling? Well… we are at .01% penetration. That&#x27;s just one out of 10,000 people who have been convinced to become Bitcoiners.

The specific number is arbitrary. It could be .01% or it could be a whopping .05% adoption rate. The point is, we are ridiculously early.
Here’s summary of what the .01% adoption rate means:

Following a move above the $24,000 level on Thursday, sentiment shifted, as traders prepared for the pivotal report, which is expected to come in at 185,000. Ethereum was also in the red, giving up a five month peak in the process.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) fell lower on Friday, as market volatility rose ahead of the latest U.S. non-farm payrolls (NFP) report.
 
Following a high of $24,091.54 on Thursday, BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $23,390.38 earlier today.
 
Friday’s fall comes as BTC bulls were unable to sustain a breakout of a key resistance level at $24,000.

                              <span>Shiba Inu is one of the most ubiquitous memecoin in the market today. Coingecko data notes a continuous upward momentum, with the token gaining nearly 8.3% in the weekly time frame with gains also made in the short periods.
 
However, these gains might be for naught as Voyager recently moved 270 billion SHIB to several exchanges, namely Binance US, Kraken, and CoinBase.
 

 
Voyager is a centralized exchange that went bankrupt due to the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund that imploded back in June last year. 
 
Recently, the exchange was slapped with a lawsuit by none other than FTX, another failed exchange that crashed this November, which is trying to gain back nearly $445.6 million in loan repayments to pay back its own creditors.

He previously explained that he is an investor and not a trader in bitcoin, thus he feels thrilled when the price of the most popular cryptocurrency drops.
 
The financial guru attributes the recent growth in precious metals and digital currencies such as Bitcoin to consumers’ worsening financial circumstances and has reiterated his endorsement for cryptocurrencies as a sensible alternative to the present currency system.

Binance shut down its operations in South Korea in 2021 as a result of bothersome obstacles such as low usage and volumes from South Korean consumers. But its recent stale in GOPAX serves as Binance’s reappearance in the East Asia-based country.
