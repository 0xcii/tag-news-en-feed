                              <span>In a recent analysis, Kiarash Hossainpour, founder of Colorways Ventures and The Consensus, warns of a potential shockwave in the Bitcoin market and pointed to several significant Bitcoin holdings that could exert significant selling pressure on the market in the first half of 2024.
 
Potential Bitcoin Sellers
 
First, Hossainpour drew attention to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has seen its holdings reduce from 621,000 BTC to just under 580,000 BTC since the launch of their spot ETF. The trust’s high annual fee of 1.5 % compared to other providers such as Bitwise (0.2 %) and BlackRock (0.25 %) as well as Grayscale’s history are currently causing a massive sell-off, which is probably responsible for the current downward trend.

                              <span>Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, finds itself at a critical juncture as several key metrics point towards a possible price downturn.
 
Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin has experienced a downward trend, with its value plummeting below the $42,000 mark after briefly touching $48,000 on January 11th.
 
Caution Signals Flash As Crypto Metrics Shift
 
One of the prominent metrics signaling caution is the Fear and Greed Index, which currently stands at 52, reflecting a neutral sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. However, historical patterns indicate that when the index enters the greed zone, a price correction often follows.

Javier Milei Defends Capitalism and Entrepreneurship at Davos
Javier Milei, president of Argentina, warned against Western society’s new path, criticizing the ideas of collectivism that, according to his thoughts, are advancing in several nations. In a speech at this year’s World Economic Forum (WEF) meetings at Davos, Milei stressed the dangers these ideas presented to today’s developed world.

The turmoil began with the disastrous depegging of UST in May 2022, creating shockwaves across the cryptocurrency market and leaving investors with billions of dollars vanished.
 
 
As the bankruptcy filing unfolds, according to Reuters, the once-bullish financial position of Terraform Labs reveals a stark reality. The estimated assets and liabilities now range between $100 million and $500 million, a far cry from the ambitious heights the company once aspired to reach.

The filing showed that the now-defunct crypto company has liabilities in the range of $100 million to $500 million. Its estimated assets also match the liabilities to be in the same range. The company&#x27;s unsecured creditors include several names, like TQ Ventures, a U.S.-based digital assets investment fund, and Standard Crypto, a San Fransisco-based venture fund.
