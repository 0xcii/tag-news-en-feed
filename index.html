volume, is evaluating its headcount, the company said on Wednesday, dispelling  
rumours that it was laying off employees to cut costs.
&quot;Binance is not

Strategy Officer, Patrick Hillmann said in a tweet. &quot;We have regularly

Let me provide some additional clarity via 🧵. Binance is not cutting 20% of employees as a cost-cutting measure. @binance experienced true exponential growth these past 5 years — and grew its staff accordingly. This was a historic operational challenge to overcome. https://t.co/Awmh8PdT8j

prosecutors in court documents, which were filed on Monday, opposed pre-trial motions  
filed by FTX&#x27;s Co-Founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers to dismiss a number of the

Prosecutors Stand by Charges
In late  
2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas over the collapse of the now-bankrupt  
cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. The arrest came after criminal charges were filed  
against him in the United States. Some of the charges include conspiracy to commit wire, bank and  
securities fraud, to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, commit  
money laundering and make unlawful political contributions.
