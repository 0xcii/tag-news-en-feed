                              <span>The top financial regulator in South Korea has now mandated crypto-related companies to be more detailed in their financial statements. The new rule, which will kick off in January 2024, aims to boost transparency in crypto disclosures. 
 
The South Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced the latest development on Tuesday, July 11, revealing that the Korea Accounting Standards Board has reviewed and approved the draft guidelines.

                              <span>Bitcoin cash rose by nearly 6% on Wednesday, following the release of the latest consumer price index (CPI) in the United States. Inflation fell by 1.0% from May, coming in at 3.0% last month. Polkadot also rose, extending its winning run for a third straight day.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) rose by as much as 6% earlier in today’s session. BCH/USD surged to a peak of $289.49 earlier in the day, which comes following Tuesday’s bottom at $271.44.
 
This rise in price has pushed the cryptocurrency towards a ceiling at $300.00, and closer to a recent 15-month high at $329.71.
 
 
From the chart, the move occurred after a marginal breakout of a ceiling at 68.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 70.56, with the next visible point of resistance at 73.00.
 
Should this point be hit, there is a strong chance that BCH will be trading at or over $300.00.
 
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) rose for a third consecutive day during Wednesday’s session, as price neared a one-week high.
 
After falling to a low at $5.13 on Tuesday, DOT/USD jumped to an intraday high of $5.30 earlier today.
 
This is the strongest level the token has hit since last Thursday, when it peaked at $5.37, marginally below a ceiling at $5.40.
 
 
Since today’s peak, earlier gains have somewhat slipped, as a result of the RSI colliding with a ceiling at 55.00.
 
Currently, price strength is at a reading of 54.55, with DOT now trading $0.05 lower than its previous high.
 
In the event this ceiling is broken, the next target for polkadot bulls will likely be $5.50.

Ark Invest Sells Coinbase Shares
 
On July 11, Bloomberg data showed that ARK Invest sold 135,152 COIN, equivalent to $12 million, out of their $1 billion COIN holdings, from ARK Innovation ETF. Notably, Ark Invest is liquidating a portion of its $1 billion COIN haul when share prices are rising, surging briefly to $90 on July 11. 
 
The Coinbase stock plunged by over 80% in 2022 after trading to as high as $430 in the last bull cycle of 2021 when crypto prices and stocks of crypto-related firms soared as valuations broke key resistance levels.

                              <span>The contraction phase of the cryptocurrency market cycle appears to be coming to an end. Led by a recovery in Bitcoin, renewed optimism in the digital asset space is driving a resurgence in a variety of sub-sectors of the crypto industry.
 
In categories such as DeFi, GameFi, and more, innovation never stopped, possibly making these unique assets especially noteworthy when growth fully resumes. Across DeFi in particular, we’ve seen early signs of a potential repeat of the 2020 DeFi summer, arriving slightly later than expected. In this article, we’ll explore the various indications that the DeFi space is about to heat up once again.

Turkey (27.1%) and Argentina (23.5%) topped the 2022 adoption list, and the countries with the most inflation seem to have the highest adoption rates. 
The oil-rich nation of Norway is at 8% cryptocurrency adoption, which is just two-thirds of the global average. Considering that it has a rather tech-savvy population, this is surprisingly low. The following factors might provide some explanation:
