The executive order, which has 366 articles, touches on major aspects of Argentine life, including rents, job regulation and land regulation. It also converts all state companies into limited companies.
Argentine President Javier Milei Launches Massive Deregulation Measures

The backlash has persisted over the years in relation to regulations to help govern the crypto industry, something that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has failed to provide to stakeholders in the industry.
 
The Gensler Interview On Regulation
 
Gary Gensler appeared on CNBC in an interview where he talked about compliance when it comes to investing. More specifically, the interview focused on laws that govern the crypto space and how the agency is working to regulate it.
 
 
In a clip of the interview shared by the SEC chairman on X (formerly Twitter), Gensler talks about how non-compliance is rampant in the crypto space…</span>

Taking to X on December 22, the CEO of Lumida Wealth, Ram Ahluwalia, has offered a theory on why ETH prices are likely to recover and reverse losses, possibly outperforming the world’s most liquid coin, Bitcoin (BTC).
 
ETHE Discount Rapidly Closing
 
To illustrate, the CEO pointed to the ETHE chart, whose discount has been steadily closing over the past few trading months. Ahluwalia observed a 4% gain on December 22, further reducing the discount.

However, on December 11, the token experienced a slight dip, hitting $0.975 per unit. Despite some improvement in its stability, the stablecoin has still not enforced its intended goal of a $1 peg.
 
GHO’s Struggle for Stability
 
Launched by Avara (formerly known as Aave), GHO has been a noteworthy example in the realm of dollar-pegged tokens. Since its inception in mid-July, the digital currency has consistently failed to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar, persistently falling short of this mark. Despite a low point of $0.917 on October 24, 2023, GHO saw an upswing towards the end of November, reaching $0.98 per coin.

The default OCEAN Knots template, which filters out any inscription transaction, as well as places an additional OP_RETURN limitation of a maximum of 42 bytes on transactions using OP_RETURN. 
Bitcoin Core patched with the Ordisrespector update, filtering out inscription transactions. 
The default Bitcoin Core template which implements no additional transaction filters at all.

For Bitcoin maximalists, Bitcoin is Bitcoin and cryptos are altcoins, if not shitcoins. Now that Bitcoin is heading for a bull run, boosted by the 4th halving hype and Bitcoin ETF approvals, Saylor’s MicroStrategy is already over $1.2 billion in unrealized profit territory.
The Bitcoin meme maker himself wasted no time in visualizing the payoff from his Bitcoin maximalism strategy.

Bitcoin
 

 
Bitcoin’s current price is situated within a 24-hour range of $43,412 to $44,243, reflecting short-term volatility. The leading crypto asset has seen a 1.1% decrease over the past day, though it maintains a 2% increase over the week and an impressive 19.6% rise over the last 30 days. Presently, oscillators provide a nuanced view of BTC’s market momentum and potential shifts.
