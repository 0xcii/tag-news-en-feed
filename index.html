The headline CPI is expected to rise from 3% to 3.3% YoY in July, a notable shift as beneficial base effects from the previous year begin to fade.

considerably, allowing retail traders back into the market. However, as it  
turns out, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has recently identified increased  
improper activities being carried out by some unlicensed virtual asset trading  
platforms (VATPs). Not only are these practices deceptive, but they also  
endanger investors. The regulator raised four main concerns and their  
implications for both VATPs and retail investors.
SFC Warns against Improper

                              <span>OPNX Exchange emerges as a potential savior for crypto lender Hodlnaut as it navigates the complexities of bankruptcy proceedings. A recent report from Bloomberg reveals that the exchange has extended a lifeline to the struggling company. By presenting a proposition to acquire 75% ownership, OPNX Exchange aims to rejuvenate Hodlnaut’s fortunes. 
 
The proposal entails an infusion of $30 million worth of FLEX tokens into the enterprise, a strategic move aimed at facilitating partial restitution to the company’s creditors, as disclosed in the report. 
 
This development underscores the intricate interplay between the world of digital finance and traditional economic mechanisms, signaling a potential turning point for Hodlnaut’s future.

Cochran’s claims are based on a detailed analysis of Huobi’s balance sheets and the recent activities of Justin Sun, the founder of Tron. He alleges that Sun has been using the exchange as a personal piggy bank, diverting funds to his other DeFi projects, and leaving the exchange with insufficient assets to meet its obligations.

                              <span>In recent times, attention has gravitated towards a novel substance known as LK-99, celebrated as a potential wonder superconductor with the capability to usher in an era of lossless power transmission, more potent computers, and stronger magnets. Yet, as scientists have been laboring to replicate the LK-99 experiment up until August 5, 2023, the academic community has yet to formally endorse the superconductivity of this material. Even so, the dialogue has evolved into almost mythical conjectures, encompassing visions of handheld quantum computers and the dismantling of today’s most robust encryption, as well as the theoretical ability to penetrate Bitcoin’s cryptography.

The network reached an all-time high on May 1, 2023, with 682,281 transactions. This unprecedented activity began its upward trend in April and has been attributed to the rise of Ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain.

                              <span>Latvijas Banka highlighted the decline in interest and use of cryptocurrency among Latvians in its “Financial Stability Report” for 2023.
 
Only 4% of people, down significantly from the 8% seen in February 2022, bought crypto assets, the central bank study claims. There are a number of reasons for this declining trend in cryptocurrency investments.
 
The bad perception of the sector is one of the main causes of the diminishing interest in cryptocurrencies. A lack of trust and faith in digital assets has been exacerbated by instances of fraud and insolvency among significant market participants.
 
Furthermore, the enthusiasm for cryptocurrency investments has probably been subdued by people’s past poor financial decisions.
