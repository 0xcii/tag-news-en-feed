                              <span>The Central Bank of Lesotho recently confirmed that its payment system was attacked by unknown cybercriminals. The bank also acknowledged that the resulting downtime is making it “impossible for all local banks to honor inter-bank transactions in the country.”
 
No Financial Loss Suffered
 
The Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) has stated that the cyber security incident on December 11, which reportedly knocked out the country’s entire payments system, did not result in “any financial or other loss.” However, the bank has “suspended some of its systems to prevent further infiltration from the attackers.”
 
While the central bank has not shared details about the severity of the attack, one South African media outlet suggested that interbank and international payments routed through the country had gone offline. Another outlet suggested that the incident posed a threat to the stability of Lesotho’s financial system and the local currency’s exchange rate versus the South African rand.
 
In a statement issued a day after the attack, the Lesotho central bank said it has since initiated an investigation into the incident and is working to restore normalcy.
 
“Consequently, some payments may be delayed while the Bank works on getting the systems back to normalcy,” the CBL said.
 

 
Meanwhile, in another statement issued on Dec. 13, the CBL, together with the Lesotho Bankers Association, confirmed that the downtime is making it “impossible for all local banks to honor inter-bank transactions in the country.”
 
The two institutions have since agreed to undertake so-called business continuity processes and measures which are expected to help facilitate transactions between banks while work to restore normal service is underway.

The realization of how inefficient and broken our societal structures are due to the limitations of fiat currency becomes increasingly apparent to everyone. While the spotlight often shines on the monetary aspects of Bitcoin, my exploration into the Lightning Network, spurred by my work at Breez and our company&#x27;s visionary goals, has unveiled an aspect that remains largely unspoken.

On Friday, December 15, the SEC rejected Coinbase’s petition for rulemaking in regard to digital asset regulations. Expressing clear support for this decision, the Commission’s chairman Gary Gensler explained that existing securities law, such as the Howey Test, already applies to cryptocurrencies.

Delivery of the mining machines is expected to help Iris Energy fulfill its goal of increasing its self-mining capacity to 10 EH/s (exahash per second).
 
Acquisition to Improve Overall Fleet Efficiency
 
The Australian Bitcoin mining company Iris Energy Limited announced on Dec. 15 that it is set to acquire $22.3 million worth of 8,380 new-generation T21 miners from Bitmain Technologies Delaware Limited. Once installed, the T21s, together with S21s, are expected to improve the Bitcoin miner’s “overall fleet efficiency from 29.5 J/TH to 24.8 J/TH.”
 
In a statement, Iris Energy said the shipment of the T21s is scheduled for the second quarter of 2024. Delivery of the mining machines is expected to help Iris Energy fulfill its goal of increasing self-mining capacity.
 
“The company’s 80MW data center expansion at Childress remains on track to be progressively delivered from January 2024 through to Q2 2024, supporting the increase in operating hash rate from 5.6 EH/s to 10 EH/s,” the Bitcoin miner said.
 
 

Iris Energy added that its 80MW data center expansion at Childress is on course to be “progressively” delivered starting in January 2024 through to Q2 2024. This is expected to support the increase in the operating hash rate.
 
According to the statement, the purchase price for the Bitcoin miners, which translates to $14/TH (terahash), is payable in progressive installments.

The prominent businessman, also known as the former husband of pop star Janet Jackson, took legal action against Meta in Dublin, Ireland, over the past three years, alleging significant reputational damage, distress, and embarrassment caused by the fraudulent ads.
