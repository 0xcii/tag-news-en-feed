The “Miners’ Position Index” (MPI) refers to a metric that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin miner outflows (in USD) and the 365-day moving average (MA) of the same.
 
The “miner outflows” here are a measure of the total amount of the cryptocurrency that’s exiting the combined wallets of all chain validators (called the “miner reserve“).

This development is noteworthy considering the depressed USDC activity in the first half of 2023 following the continuation of the crypto bear market.
