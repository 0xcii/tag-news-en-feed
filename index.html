                              <span>In a recent development in the high-profile case of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, a request for postponement of the sentencing hearing was firmly denied by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan. Bankman-Fried’s legal team had sought a four to six-week adjournment, citing the need for additional preparation time. However, the court’s refusal to grant this extension marks a significant moment in this ongoing legal saga.
 
Sam Bankman-Fried Sentencing Date Proceeds as Kaplan Denies Delay
 
The defense, representing Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), submitted a formal request for the adjournment of the sentencing hearing, originally scheduled for March 28, 2024. This plea was grounded in the defense’s requirement for more time to gather necessary materials and prepar…</span>

However, this has not discouraged users who believe that Dogecoin payments are coming to X, one of whom is MyDoge Wallet CTO Alex Lewis.

Over the past month, solana has experienced a 42% surge, while avalanche has soared by 104%.
 
Solana and Avalanche Make Strong Comeback in Crypto Market
 
Following the collapse of the Terra blockchain and the FTX failure, SOL and AVAX suffered substantial declines against the U.S. dollar. These cryptocurrencies, once ranked among the top ten, were briefly ousted from their elite top ten status.
 
However, they have since reclaimed their positions among the top ten leading tokens, with SOL currently in fifth place, having overtaken XRP, and AVAX…</span>

Cardano Founder Celebrates Full Blocks
 
For the longest time, the Cardano network has been referred to as a zombie chain due to it not seeing as many transactions as other networks in the same category. However, as the price of its native token, ADA, has been on the rise, so has the network usage.
