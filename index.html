                              <span>On October 13, 2023, California enacted the Digital Financial Assets law. This law is California’s first comprehensive framework for regulation of digital asset markets, and some of its provisions may sound familiar to those versed in the state’s money transmitter licensing requirements. Under this new law, on and after July 2025, crypto companies and everyone else will need, in addition to other criteria, a license to operate or hold themselves out as being able to operate digital financial asset business activity, with or on behalf of California residents.

                              <span>The recent delisting and subsequent relisting of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has caused a stir in the cryptocurrency market. 
 
The sudden removal of the ETF from the DTCC’s listings on Tuesday, coupled with the temporary unavailability of the DTCC website, led to a significant drop in Bitcoin’s price. 
 
However, after being relisted, Bitcoin has resumed its bullish trajectory, trading at $34,600 to reclaim the $35,000 level.
 
Delisting Of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust Sparks Controversy 
 
BlackRock’s proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust was added to the DTCC’s reference database on Monday with the IBTC ticker symbol. However, without any explanation, IBTC was abruptly removed from the DTCC’s listings…</span>

Lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried are interested in the “elicited testimony” gathered by two FBI agents who interviewed Gary Wang and Nishad Singh.

                              <span>Blockchain security auditor Hacken recently revealed concerning insights into the proliferation of ‘rug pulls, a malicious tactic aimed at stealing funds from crypto users, and how they accounted for the majority of Q3 crypto scams.
 
Rug Pulls: The Prevalent Crypto Scourge
 
‘Rug pulls,’ as they are colloquially referred to, are a specific type of exit scam. Project teams artificially inflate the value of their token before abruptly removing all liquidity, leaving investors in the lurch. Disturbingly, this method made up roughly 65.1% of all Q3 hacks, Hacken’s research showed.
 
 
According to the report, a core reason behind such high numbers is the ease with which these scams can be concocted. With “token factories” churning out fraudulent tokens en masse, this menace seems poised to co…</span>

This decision, while seen as a risky maneuver, will subject Bankman-Fried to cross-examination by federal prosecutors.
 
FTX Founder Set To Face Prosecution
 
Bankman-Fried’s defense team had previously argued that resolving his access to medication for Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was necessary for his full participation in the defense. 
 
With the medication issue now resolved, the FTX founder will testify in his defense, allowing federal prosecutors to question him regarding the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX.

Jamie Dimon Discusses Greatest Threats to Global Economy
 
The chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, discussed the greatest threats to the global economy and the state of the U.S. economy on Tuesday during a panel discussion at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
