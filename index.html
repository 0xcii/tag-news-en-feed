                              <span>Worldcoin is eying a potential partnership with  
artificial intelligence research firm OpenAI, according to a report by  
Bloomberg. This latest development arrives despite the regulatory hurdles  
facing the digital identity platform over privacy concerns. Through its parent company, Tools for Humanity, the cryptocurrency project plans to expand its services.
Navigating Regulatory Challenges  

Most recently, Spain and Portugal recently raised concerns over  
the inclusion of children in the project&#x27;s iris scanning initiative, prompting  
regulatory action. Previously, the project collaborated with  
cybersecurity firm Okta Inc. to offer an authentication service. The company&#x27;s  
identity systems offer solutions for validating individuals in an increasingly  
digital world dominated by AI. 
With the rise of artificial intelligence, the need to  
distinguish between humans and bots is important. Sam Altman, the Co-Founder of  
Worldcoin, is renowned for his involvement with OpenAI. Currently, he serves as  
the CEO of the company. Amidst regulatory challenges, Tools for Humanity is  
enhancing its product. The firm is planning to launch a layer-2 blockchain  
called World Chain and improve the orb device.
However, despite a successful fundraising round last  
year, Tools for Humanity is reportedly facing uncertainty in tapping into the  
crypto market for additional funding. Market volatility and pricing  
fluctuations have prompted a reevaluation of planned token sales.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

                              <span>Bitcoin is one of the most robust distributed systems in the history of mankind. For fifteen years it has ticked along block by block with only two disruptions in its first few years that were very quickly handled by responsive developers the minute they manifested themselves. Aside from that, it has ticked along producing a block roughly every ten minutes with no interruptions. 
This reliability has set a golden standard of expectations for Bitcoin users, encouraging them to view it as a completely unstoppable system. In many peoples’ minds, Bitcoin has already won, and the world is just catching up with that realization. “Bitcoin is inevitable” as many would say.

Under the new laws, EU CASPs will need to perform customer due diligence on transactions originating from self-custodial wallets for transactions below 1000 EUR, and implement additional KYC measures for transactions above 1000 EUR.

                              <span>Crypto analyst Crypto Noan has revealed a profit-taking strategy that crypto investors can adopt as they invest in Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest meme coin by market cap. This strategy would be most beneficial to those who need guidance in securing profits as the meme coin continues to make significant price gains. 
 
Price Levels To Secure Profits From Shiba Inu
 
In a chart shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Crypto Noan highlighted four price targets from which Shiba Inu investors should look to take profits. The first take profit zone he highlighted was at $0.000028181. The second take profit zone was at $0.000032816; this serves as a moderate target for those who may not be satisfied with the returns at the initial take profit target.

The report, conducted by KPMG in Canada and the Canadian Association of Alternative Assets and Strategies (CAASA), paints a picture of a booming crypto market fueled by investor confidence and a supportive regulatory environment.
 
 
Crypto Goes Mainstream In Canada
 
In 2023, a staggering 39% of surveyed institutional investors reported exposure to crypto assets, a sharp increase from 31% just two years prior. This newfound interest translates into action, with a significant portion of these investors allocating a substantial share of their portfolios to crypto.

The company, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, declared its intention to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset earlier this month on X. Metaplanet stated its plan to buy ¥1 billion in Bitcoin as an initial commitment.
The company&#x27;s recent announcement on X revealed that they have fulfilled their commitment, purchasing ¥1 billion worth of Bitcoin. 
This move closely mimics the strategy employed by MicroStrategy, a U.S.-based company that has been accumulating Bitcoin since 2020. MicroStrategy&#x27;s Bitcoin purchases have led to a dramatic increase in its share price.
Following the announcement earlier this month, Metaplanet&#x27;s stock price also saw a significant increase, indicating investor confidence in the company&#x27;s decision to invest in Bitcoin. 
Jason, from Sora Ventures, referred to Metaplanet as &quot;Asia&#x27;s first MicroStrategy,&quot; highlighting the potential impact of this move on the Asian market.

Metaplanet&#x27;s Bitcoin investment offers Japanese investors a unique opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin without incurring an unrealized gains tax, which can be as high as 55%. 
Additionally, anyone with an account on the Tokyo Stock Exchange can now indirectly invest in Bitcoin through Metaplanet without facing the regulatory risks associated with direct purchases.
This development is seen as a positive step for Bitcoin and its market in Asia, as it demonstrates growing acceptance and adoption by traditional financial institutions and publicly listed companies.</span>
