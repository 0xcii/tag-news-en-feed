Deaton has been active in the long-running SEC lawsuit against blockchain firm Ripple and the US-based lawyer represents thousands of token holders as Amicus Curiae in the lawsuit. Given this, Deaton has repeatedly blasted the SEC for taking an unclearly broad position in its claim against Ripple.
 
In light of his efforts, several members of the XRP community took to Twitter, expressing gratitude to the pro-crypto lawyer for protecting their interest in the litigation. Deaton also shared a note of appreciation from an XRP holder appreciating him for defending them.

                              <span>Shiba inu moved closer to a six-month low on Wednesday, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets shifted bearish. Litecoin was another notable token to fall, slipping by over 4% today. The global market cap is currently down by over 2% at the time of writing. 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) fell below a key support point earlier in today’s session, moving closer to a six-month low as a result.
 
Following a high of $0.000008784 on Tuesday, SHIB/USD dropped to a intraday low of $0.000008398 earlier in the day.
 
This drop resulted in the meme coin falling below a key support point of $0.000008500, approaching its lowest point since January 8.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the latest decline comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved towards a floor at 32.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 33.76, following a failed breakout of a ceiling at 44.00.
 
Should price strength fall to the aforementioned support point, there is a good chance SHIB will hit a new six-month low.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was another notable mover on Wednesday, as prices plunged by as much as 4%.
 
LTC/USD dropped to a low of $88.35 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after hitting a high at $92.59.
 
It appears that this latest decline comes following a failed breakout attempt of a ceiling at the $93.50 mark in recent days.
 
 
In addition to this point of resistance, the RSI ran into a hurdle of its own at the 57.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 50.35, which is marginally above a recent support at the 50.00 level.
 
LTC has somewhat rebounded from earlier lows and at the time of writing, is trading at $89.08.

                              <span>Crypto Analyst Roger Ver, aka Bitcoin Jesus, believes that Ethereum will bring a new wave of users into cryptocurrency rather than Bitcoin.
 
Bitcoin is the market leader for cryptocurrencies, with several individuals and institutions using the cryptocurrency as a store of value. However, Ethereum is the driving force behind the new wave of development and DApp building on multiple chains. 
 
Also, it is a thriving hub for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), among other vital innovations in its ecosystem. As such, Ver, an early investor in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, said that the Ethereum ecosystem is where the action is.

Despite tether (USDT) approaching its all-time high in terms of market capitalization, the stablecoin economy is currently experiencing its lowest value range since September 2021.

                              <span>Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, has allegedly initiated a round of layoffs, according to sources who spoke with Chinese reporter Colin Wu, who runs the popular blockchain-focused Twitter account WuBlockchain.
 
Multiple sources have confirmed to WuBlockchain that the exchange has begun laying off employees, though the proportion of layoffs remains uncertain. With a reported total of around 8,000 employees, rumors suggest that the proportion of layoffs in June was approximately 20%.
 
Binance In Crisis?
 
According to Colin Wu, the compensation plan for affected employees will be formulated based on different situations in different locations. However, it is worth noting that some departments are still reportedly continuing to recruit.

Bitcoin 7-Day Mining Hashrate Has Continued To Rise Recently
 
The “mining hashrate” here refers to a measure of the total amount of computing power that the Bitcoin miners have currently connected to the network.
 
When this metric rises, it means the miners are bringing in more machines online on the network right now. Generally, this kind of trend is a sign that these chain validators are finding it profitable to mine on the network currently.
 
On the other hand, decreasing values imply some miners are leaving the chain at the moment. Such a trend can suggest the miners aren’t finding it that attractive to mine the cryptocurrency.
