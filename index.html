                              <span>Famous Pershing Square Capital Management founder and CEO Bill Ackman has turned his focus to Bitcoin, which has sparked a passionate discussion over the possible consequences of the cryptocurrency’s recent surge. Ackman made a playful scenario presentation on social media, which made many in the industry wonder what it could mean for the biggest cryptocurrency in the world.
