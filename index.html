                              <span>Janet Yellen, the U.S. secretary of the Treasury, sent a letter to Congress on Friday urging lawmakers to increase the spending limit. Yellen stressed that the country would reach its statutory debt limit on Jan. 19, 2023. She warned that “failure to meet the government’s obligations would cause irreparable harm to the U.S. economy, the livelihoods of all Americans, and global financial stability.”
 
Yellen Warns of Approaching Debt Limit, Urges Congress to Act Swiftly
 
On Friday, Jan. 13, 2023, the United States Treasury published a press release featuring a letter written by Janet Yellen, the 78th U.S. secretary of the Treasury. The letter is addressed to the House of Representatives and the newly appointed 55th speaker, Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).

                              <span>Solana surged by as much as 30% on Saturday, setting a fresh multi-month high in the process. The move comes as cryptocurrency markets were significantly bullish to start the weekend, with the global market cap 8.28% higher as of writing. Shiba inu was trading at its strongest point since November.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) was easily one of the biggest movers to start the weekend, with prices skyrocketing by as much as 30%.
 
Following a low of $16.52 yesterday, SOL/USD surged to an intraday high of $22.37 earlier today.
 
As a result of today’s rally the token hit its strongest point since November 9, when price was at a top of $24.60.
 
 
From the chart, the move commenced after yet another burst beyond a resistance point on the 14-day relative strength (RSI).
 
On this occasion, the index moved above a ceiling at the 80.00 level, and is now tracking at 85.44.
 
Although solana bulls will have their eyes set on $25.00, there could be a cooling off of the earlier rally as the day matures.
 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) was once again a notable gainer in crypto markets, as the meme coin rose by over 10% today.
 
SHIB/USD hit a peak of $0.00001081 to start the weekend, after ending the working week at a low of $0.000009462.
 
Like with solana above, this resulted in prices climbing to their highest level since early November.
 
 
Overall, shiba inu has now risen for a third consecutive session, and is up 24% in the last seven days.
 
Earlier gains have already begun to show signs of easing, with price now trading at $0.00001039.
 
This comes after the RSI failed to break out of its long-term resistance point at the 80.00 mark.

                              <span>Bitcoin surged to a fresh two-month high on Jan. 14, as crypto markets were significantly higher on Saturday. The world’s largest cryptocurrency jumped above $21,000, as prices rallied for a sixth straight day. Ethereum traded above $1,500 to start the weekend, also hitting its strongest point since November.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rose for a sixth straight session to start the weekend, as prices moved above the $21,000 level.
 
BTC/USD climbed to a peak of $21,054.38 earlier in today’s session, which comes after prices were at a bottom of $18,793.66 on Friday.
 
This spike in price saw bitcoin add as much as 10% to its value in the last 24 hours, hitting its strongest point since November 5 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to surge. It is now tracking at 89.22.
 
Typically, a reading of 70.00 is seen as overbought, and with this print, which is its highest point in two years, we are deep in bear territory.
 
When price becomes overbought, many expect bearish sentiment to grow, as traders begin to short the market.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also hit a two-month high in today’s session, with price staying in the green for a seventh consecutive day.
 
Following a low of $1,404.82 on Friday, ETH/USD moved to an intraday high of $1,558.25 on Saturday.
 
As with bitcoin, this rally sent the world’s second largest cryptocurrency to its highest point since November 5.
 
 
Overall, ethereum is now trading over 23% higher in the last seven days.
 
The move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average extended a crossover of its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Despite this bullish momentum to start the weekend, many still expect some reversals over the next few days.

This may seem as a surprise, but with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showing an improving economic trend, a further upwards break is possible for BTC. 
 
Analysts say that if BTC breaks through this crucial resistance, the start of the bull market is at hand. However, rejection from this resistance is imminent at time of writing. Can Bitcoin overcome this in the next few days?

                              <span>The presence of over 500 blockchain and Web3 firms inside the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC)’s Crypto Centre shows that demand for space is still very high, a statement has said. According to CEO at DMCC Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the “record-high” number of overall new company registrations indicates the extent of investors’ “confidence in the emirate.”
 
New Milestone for DMCC
 
According to the United Arab Emirates-based Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), the demand for space at its “Crypto Centre” grew significantly, and this can be evidenced by the over 500 blockchain and Web3 firms that were registered with the Crypto Centre by the end of 2022. The surge in the demand for space at the DMCC centre came against the backdrop of a 23% year-on-year increase in the number of registered members from 2,485 in 2021 to the 3,049 seen by the end of 2022.
 
Commenting on what is seen as a new milestone for the commodities centre, Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the executive chairman and CEO at DMCC, said:
 

Backed by a strong regional macroeconomic landscape, DMCC has been efficiently accelerating its growth strategy throughout 2022, focusing on supporting its member companies in high-impact sectors such as web3 and blockchain technologies, commodities and global trade. The unprecedented performance this year reflects this growth acceleration and highlights the significant value that DMCC adds to each of its members.
 
The CEO also suggested that the “record-high” number of new company registrations could well indicate the extent of investors’ “confidence in the emirate.”
 

 
Meanwhile, Feryal Ahmadi, the chief operating officer (COO) at the DMCC suggested that his organization would seek to “build on its position of strength by further enhancing its services and offerings” and by forging new alliances around the world.

Das said in his speech at a conference on Friday that RBI’s stance on cryptocurrency remains unchanged.
 
The bank official disclosed that digital currencies cannot be considered as a financial product and must be treated like “gambling activities.”
 
The RBI has been vocal about its opposition to such currencies and also took a lead over other central banks by launching its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) late last October.
