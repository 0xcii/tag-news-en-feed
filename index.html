Davidson’s move comes as a response to what he perceives as Gensler’s overreach in the digital currency space, with the SEC’s proposed redefinition of an “exchange” drawing widespread criticism. 
 
As tensions mount between regulators and the bitcoin community, the fate of Gensler and the future of crypto regulation hangs in the balance.

As Bitcoinist reported yesterday, the community was outraged that XRP is not part of the product, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are used to provide businesses with a seamless way to manage their crypto liquidity needs.
 
The outcry has prompted Ripple’s chief legal officer (CLO) to speak out on the issue. In a Twitter thread, Stuart Alderoty clarified that XRP may become part of the product later. He also set the record straight on the distinction between LH and the XRP based product On-Demand Liquidity (ODL).

                              <span>Hester Peirce, a commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has issued her opinion on the recent attempts of the institution to change the definition of “exchange” under the Exchange Act Rule. According to Peirce, the institution is now expanding its reach to solve “problems that do not exist,” stifling innovation in the process.
SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Issues Dissenting Opinion
U.S. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, also known in cryptocurrency circles as “crypto mom,” has written a letter blasting the recent decision of the Commission to amend the definition of “exchange” under the Exchange Act Rule. Peirce states that instead of bolstering innovation, this decision will render it “kaput,” bringing even more confusion to cryptocurrency circles in the U.S.

                              <span>Despite the global crypto market showcasing a bullish trajectory, regulatory scrutiny could become an obstacle for the nascent industry. Earlier today, the New York Finance Watchdog implemented a new rule set to bill licensed crypto firms over supervisory costs.
 
This bill mainly targets New York crypto firms registered under the BitLicense. This requirement allows a company to conduct virtual currency business activities in New York or with a New York Resident.
 
 
Crypto Firms To Be Charged Over Supervisory Costs
 
According to an announcement, cryptocurrency companies registered under the New York state will start receiving bills over supervision fees. The fees collected from this regulation will allegedly help the regulator add “top talent” and additional resources.

And yet &quot;The Mooch&quot; tells Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott &quot;I&#x27;m more bullish now than I have ever been&quot; on crypto as an investment case. He discusses his frustration with SBF, how wrong he thinks politicians like Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler are about crypto and how to regulate it, what he sees happening next with adoption, and talks about Trump.

                              <span>Gnosis first launched in 2015 as a decentralized prediction market built on Ethereum. Now it&#x27;s a DAO, a multi-sig wallet, a staking chain, and a vibrant community with its own GNO governance token. Co-founder and COO Friederike Ernst talked to Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott about the careful evolution of Gnosis, decentralization impostors, account abstraction, DeFi UX failures, why Ethereum is the &quot;Manhattan of crypto,&quot; and much more.
