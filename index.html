                              <span>Ethereum (ETH) prices have been languishing below the $2,500 mark despite the strong performance of other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). 
 
Taking to X on December 22, the CEO of Lumida Wealth, Ram Ahluwalia, has offered a theory on why ETH prices are likely to recover and reverse losses, possibly outperforming the world’s most liquid coin, Bitcoin (BTC).
 
ETHE Discount Rapidly Closing
 
To illustrate, the CEO pointed to the ETHE chart, whose discount has been steadily closing over the past few trading months. Ahluwalia observed a 4% gain on December 22, further reducing the discount. 
 
 
Based on the CEO’s analysis, this development suggests that institutional investors, most of whom chose to buy the regulated ETHE product by Grayscale to gain exposure in a regula…</span>

                              <span>Roughly three weeks ago, Bitcoin.com News covered the stablecoin GHO, when it achieved a notable milestone by reaching $0.98 per coin. However, on December 11, the token experienced a slight dip, hitting $0.975 per unit. Despite some improvement in its stability, the stablecoin has still not enforced its intended goal of a $1 peg.
 
GHO’s Struggle for Stability
 
Launched by Avara (formerly known as Aave), GHO has been a noteworthy example in the realm of dollar-pegged tokens. Since its inception in mid-July, the digital currency has consistently failed to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar, persistently falling short of this mark. Despite a low point of $0.917 on October 24, 2023, GHO saw an upswing towards the end of November, reaching $0.98 per coin.

In the second part of our discussion with Dr Gabbay, an expert in financial regulation and enforcement, we learn about differing crypto approaches in the EU, whether crypto firms are still willing to do business in the US, the need for bridges between the crypto industry and traditional finance, also touching on political influence and the likelihood of approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs.

For Bitcoin maximalists, Bitcoin is Bitcoin and cryptos are altcoins, if not shitcoins. Now that Bitcoin is heading for a bull run, boosted by the 4th halving hype and Bitcoin ETF approvals, Saylor’s MicroStrategy is already over $1.2 billion in unrealized profit territory.
The Bitcoin meme maker himself wasted no time in visualizing the payoff from his Bitcoin maximalism strategy.
