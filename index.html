This initiative aims to provide a structured approach to addressing issues and concerns related to cryptocurrencies on a global scale.

China’s annual inflation rate fell to 0.7% in March, from February’s 1.0%, according to official numbers released by the National Bureau of Statistics. That’s the lowest figure since September 2021, noted the Trading Economics website which quoted the data.

However, Riot Platforms, a leading Bitcoin mining company, claims the New York Times article was full of “distortions” and “falsehoods” designed to push a political agenda. In response to the New York Times allegations, Riot defended the industry and emphasized its commitment to sustainable Bitcoin mining practices.

                              <span>With hierarchical channels, Lightning may overcome its scalability limitations by enabling quick and flexible off-chain resizing of channels.
Developers are exploring the use of hierarchical channels to help speed up and make the Lightning Network (LN) more scalable. Hierarchical channels allow for flexible off-chain resizing of channels, enabling quick and cheap resizing, without on-chain transactions which add delays and costs. In contrast, resizing channels on-chain can cause delays of several months and increases fees. The current proposals for resizing channels off-chain involve creating a channel factory or CoinPool and exchanging capacity between channels within the same factory or pool.
