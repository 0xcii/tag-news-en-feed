CME Expansion in Crypto Markets
Although not officially confirmed or commented on by the exchange, the plans to offer Bitcoin trading came when demand for the cryptocurrency among Wall Street money managers was surging. If launched, it would not be CME’s first foray into cryptocurrencies. The Chicago-based exchange is already operating a cryptocurrency futures exchange, which offers standard and micro futures contracts of Bitcoin and Ether. CME even ranks at the top of Bitcoin futures exchanges in terms of open interest, surpassing Binance, which otherwise dominates the spot market.

cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has experienced significant growth over the past  
year and, after five years of operation, has surpassed 20 million users.

investors about the exchange, reminding of its lack of authorization in this
