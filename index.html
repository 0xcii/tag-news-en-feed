WazirX To Restore All Account Balances
 
On July 18, WazirX fell victim to a security breach that took approximately $235 million from one of the trading platforms’ multisig wallets. The crypto heist stole millions of ETH, SHIB, PEPE, MATIC, and other tokens, leaving thousands of users empty-handed.
 
As a result, the platform halted operations and set into motion a plan to recover the stolen funds. The bounty program designated 10% of the stolen funds, around $23 million, to those who assisted WazirX’s team in rec…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded their largest inflows in over two weeks on Thursday, totalling $192.5 million. This comes after Bitcoin dipped below $50,000 earlier this week amid a global market selloff.

NEW: 🇺🇸 #Bitcoin ETFs saw $192 million in inflows, the highest in over two weeks.

The inflows helped propel Bitcoin back above $60,000 on Friday. It represents a swift reversal after Bitcoin plunged nearly 20% to its lowest level since February.
The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the bounce back, with inflows of $157.6 million on Thursday. The WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (BTCW) also had a standout day, attracting over $118.5 million in fresh capital—its largest single-day haul since launching.
BTCW has generally lagged behind rivals, struggling to break $11 million in daily inflows since debuting in January. Its prior record was $10.5 million. But Thursday&#x27;s surge made it the top performer.
The inflows provide evidence of renewed appetite for Bitcoin exposure after a wave of selling earlier in the week, which also battered stock markets like the Nasdaq. Last Friday&#x27;s disappointing U.S. jobs report triggered recession fears.
The bounce back in prices and inflows suggests the Bitcoin selloff may have been a temporary blip rather than the start of a new bearish trend. The recovery to $60,000 has bulls eyeing a retest of all-time highs above $73,000 in 2024.</span>
