                              <span>Polygon retreated from a multi-month high to start the week, as traders moved in to secure recent gains. Chainlink also moved lower, as prices were unable to break out of a key resistance level. Market sentiment in cryptocurrencies shifted today, with the global market cap trading 2.11% lower as of writing.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was one of Monday’s most notable movers, with prices retreating from recent gains.
 
MATIC/USD slipped to an intraday bottom of $1.11 to start the week, less than 24 hours after rising to a high at $1.19 on Sunday.
 
Sunday’s move pushed polygon to its strongest point since November 8, as prices neared a ceiling of $1.20.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the decline in MATIC commenced following a failed breakout of a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 62.98, after failing to move beyond a resistance level of 73.00
 
Price strength now seems to be looking for a floor, with a target of 60.00 a possible destination for sellers.
 

 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) was also lower to start the week, as the token was unable to move beyond a key price ceiling over the weekend.
 
Following a high of $7.45 on Sunday, LINK/USD declined to a low of $6.98 earlier in the day.
 
Like with polygon, today’s decline in chainlink came after a failed breakout of the resistance level at $7.50.
 
 
As of writing, LINK is back above $7.00, as earlier declines have somewhat eased. This comes as the RSI moves closer to a point of support.
 
The index is currently tracking at 56.06, with a floor of 55.00 the next visible target for bears.
 
Bulls are likely still present, however, and could look to make a move above $7.50 in the coming days.

Cardano Addresses With 1 Million To 100 Million ADA Have Been Selling Recently
 
According to an analyst on Twitter, a total of 31 addresses holding large amounts of Cardano have sold off their coins recently. The relevant indicator here is the on-chain analytics firm Santiment’s “ADA Supply Distribution,” which tells us (among other things) which wallet groups include how many addresses right now.
 
The “wallet groups” here define the ranges between which the number of coins that wallets belonging to them hold. For instance, the 100-1,000 coins group includes all addresses that are holding at least 100 and at most 1,000 ADA currently.
