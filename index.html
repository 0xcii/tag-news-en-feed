Nasdaq-Listed Iris Energy Bolsters Mining Arsenal with Latest Next-Gen Mining Rig Purchase
 
Just over two weeks ago, Bitmain introduced its S21 series Antminers, boasting an efficiency rating of less than 20 joules per terahash (J/T). Following this, the publicly traded bitcoin mining company Iris Energy, traded on Nasdaq under the ticker IREN, confirmed its purchase of 1.4 EH/s of Bitmain’s S21 miners.

This statistic means that roughly 93% of users will stop using the platform to transfer tokens or deploy smart contracts within a year. This suggests that the platform (or its underlying technology) is still perceived to be complex, or users might not be too eager to engage and interact.
 
Ethereum Is Struggling With User Retention
 
Despite its clear lead and popularity, what could disincentivize users from using Ethereum is not immediately clear. Token Terminal, an analytics platform, posted a graph showing fast-falling interest over time based on data collected between August 2015 and October 2023.

Today, Caroline Ellison, Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend and former head of Alameda Research, FTX’s trading arm, brought serious allegations in the courtroom. 
 
Trial Reveals FTX-Alameda Connection In Fund Misappropriation Case
 
According to Bloomberg, during the trial, defense lawyer Mark Cohen, in his opening statement, partially attributed the collapse of FTX to Ellison’s failure to hedge Alameda’s risky cryptocurrency bets in 2022. 
 
However, Ellison admitted to being aware that FTX utilized customer funds to support Alameda, further stating that she, Bankman-Fried, and others conspired to deceive le…</span>

The trend will likely continue, looking at the price and volume ratios of Ethereum and Bitcoin in recent days. A clear divergence shows that Bitcoin could be extending its lead over Ethereum, reinforcing Kaiko’s findings.
 
 
The Ethereum Merge: Shift To Proof-of-Stake

SBF Lawyers Into The Loan’s Legalities
 
Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the now-defunct FTX exchange, seems to be in a tangle over the loans given out by Alameda Research. Lawyers on his team are eager to question Gary Wang about the details and the legal counsels involved in the loans he received from the trading firm.
 
 
Last week, during the trial, the prosecutors delved deep into Wang’s financial activities. They pointedly asked about what they described as “a series of personal loans” that ranged from roughly $200-$300 million. 
 
These loans were notable as they were issued to Wang from Alam…</span>

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Gone Down Recently
 
An analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that the Coinbase Premium Index has been decreasing recently. The “Coinbase Premium Index” here refers to the percentage difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).
 
The former exchange is used more by US-based investors (especially large institutional holders), while the latter has global traffic. As such, the Coinbase Premium Index can reveal the difference in the behaviors of the two demographics.

                              <span>In the wake of FTX’s collapse, the crypto industry was plunged. Prices plummeted, investors scrambled to cut their losses, and startup funding evaporated. Amid the chaos, the spotlight turned to Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, as the last remaining tycoon in the crypto world after the swift fall of Sam Bankman-Fried. 
 
With a grand vision to rescue struggling startups, Zhao rallied industry leaders to raise a minimum of $1 billion. However, according to Bloomberg, the Industry Recovery Initiative (IRI) fell short of expectations nearly a year later, leaving the crypto market starved for cash and companies on the brink of collapse.

Graham Rodford, the CEO and Co-Founder of Archax, said:

                              <span>Dave Weisberger, Co-Founder and CEO of CoinRoutes, argued that excessive regulation in the U.S. threatens to undermine the country&#x27;s long-standing dominance in global financial markets. He warned that other countries are embracing blockchain and crypto to build more efficient digital markets, which could cause the US to lose its competitive edge and trillions in GDP. Weisberger said CoinRoutes is now focusing more on expanding internationally due to restrictive policies in the U.S. He was interviewed by André Beganski of Decrypt at Messari Mainnet 2023.</span>
