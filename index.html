According to an official blog post on the crypto exchange’s website, Binance Charity revealed it has processed over 82,000 applications to the Binance Scholar Program since the launch of the initiative back in July 2022.

                              <span>National Geographic was unprepared for the level of criticism it received after announcing their inaugural NFT collection.
 
Those who read the magazine with an interest in nature hoped their readers would take to NFTs. After all, the publication is committed to writing about primates, which are all the rage these days in the NFT “jungle.”
 
According to a report, the backlash began when their social media accounts posted the infamous Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT last week.
 
The purpose of the nature-focused publication’s message was to prepare their audience for the Polygon launch of their own-branded NFTs named the Genesis Collection.
 
 
It is a collection of digital art based on the popular photographs of National Geographic’s finest lensmen, including Justin Aversano and Catch Simard.

                              <span>Solana rose by as much as 20% Saturday, as crypto markets came alive to start the weekend. The token hit a 12-week high in today’s session, breaking out of a key price ceiling in the process. Cardano also rose to its strongest point since November, with the global cryptocurrency market cap up 6.86% as of writing.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL), was one of Saturday’s notable gainers, as the token rose by as much as 20% in today’s session.
 
SOL/USD hit a high of $26.41 to start the weekend, which follows on from Friday’s low at $21.27.
 
As a result of this move, solana broke out of a key resistance level of $25.00, hitting its strongest point since November 8 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also broke out of a ceiling of its own at the 73.00 mark.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 73.84, with the next visible resistance at the 81.00 zone.
 
If bulls were to collide with this wall, then it is likely that solana could move above the $30.00 point.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Another big mover on the weekend was cardano (ADA), which also moved to its strongest point since November.
 
Following a low of $0.3364 on Saturday, ADA/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.3726 earlier today.
 
This surge saw cardano jump to its strongest point in the past 12 weeks, breaking out of a resistance of $0.3650 in the process.
 
 
As can be seen on the chart, the move took price strength to a ceiling of 73.00, however, it has so far failed to overcome this hurdle.
 
Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as traders moved to secure gains, leading to ADA currently trading at $0.366.
 
Should this obstacle be eventually overcome, the next target for ADA bulls will likely be $0.40.

                              <span>Bitcoin surged to a five-month high to start the weekend, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets. Prices of the world’s largest digital currency rose above $23,000, rebounding from a recent drop towards $20,000. Ethereum also rallied, as it hit its strongest point since September.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) raced past the $23,000 level to start the weekend, with prices climbing to a multi-month high.
 
Following a low of $20,961.21 on Friday, BTC/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $23,249.89 earlier today.
 
Today’s rally saw bitcoin jump to its highest level since August 24, when price at the time was trading at a top of $23,600.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved back towards a ceiling of 90.00.
 
Currently, the index is at the 86.30 level, with earlier gains somewhat fading, as traders move to secure profits.
 
As of writing, BTC is trading at $22,902.03, which is still roughly 9.27% higher than yesterday’s low.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Like bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) also surged on Saturday, as it climbed to its highest mark in the last four months.
 
ETH/USD hit a high of $1,674.18 earlier in the day, which comes following a bottom of $1,550.03 on Friday.
 
As a result of the move, ethereum recaptured a high not seen since September 13, which is the last time it traded over $1,700.
 
 
Although prices are currently below this threshold, the resurgence of bullish momentum on Saturday could lead to further surges this weekend.
 
The surge has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average back into an uptrend, extending its distance from its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Overall, ethereum is up 6.28% as of writing.

According to Yahoo! Finance, Hoskinson’s reasoning as to why he has shown strong interest in buying up DCG’s media unit is that he believes journalism integrity should be restored. The Cardano co-founder’s interest was made known after CoinDesk announced its exploration of a possible sale.
 
Hoskinson disclosed in a video livestream in the U.S., last week:
 

“My interest on the media side is more broad… I would like to figure out how to get to journalistic integrity again.”

Crypto Valley in Switzerland Maintains Number of Residents Despite Crypto Winter
 
The market downturn and the collapse of platforms like cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the Terra-luna ecosystem sent shockwaves through the industry. The negative events of 2022 led to losses for investors, customers, and companies while major players like Coinbase and Genesis announced layoffs.

                              <span>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is looking to adopt cryptocurrency in a ‘major role’ in its trading policies, according to a report by Bloomberg. 
 
Speaking with Bloomberg Television in Davos, Switzerland – where the World Economic Forum is currently being held – UAE’s minister of state for foreign trade, Thani Al-Zeyoudi, made some positive statements on the potential role of cryptocurrency in the economy of the gulf nation.
 
“Crypto will play a major role for UAE trade going forward,” said Al-Zeyoudi. For years now, the UAE government has been working on transforming the nation into a global crypto hub, mainly by implementing crypto-friendly policies with the goal of attracting the big guns in the $1 trillion industry.
