                              <span>After the FTX hacker transferred 5,000 ethereum (ETH) valued at $8 million in purloined assets, the cybercriminal shifted an additional 25,000 ether, totaling $43.15 million. Yet, even after relocating tens of millions of dollars in ethereum, the FTX wallet drainer still holds a whopping 155,749 ETH, currently valued at slightly above $268 million.
 
FTX Hacker Moves 30,000 Ether
 
In the past three days, the individual responsible for the FTX theft has shifted a total of 30,000 ETH, worth approximately $51.15 million based on current ETH values. Following two initial transfers of 2,500 ETH each, subsequent movements were 1,250 ETH, 2,500 ETH, 1,500 ETH, 4,750 ETH and two separate transfers of 7,500 ETH each.
 
The hacker’s holdings also include 155,749 ETH valued at $268 million, 3.97 million tether (USDT), 1.68 million DAI and 1.57 BTC, along with a variety of other crypto assets and ERC20 tokens. This news emerges as former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried prepares for his October 3 trial, marking the start of jury selection. Some speculate the FTX wallet hack was an inside job, given the timing of the fund transfers.
 
 
In a conversation with reporter Tiffany Fong, Bankman-Fried speculated the perpetrator might be a former employee. “I’ve narrowed it down to like eight people. I don’t know which one it was,” he shared with Fong. The breach was first detected the day FTX declared bankruptcy. Former FTX US General Counsel Ryne Miller noted the team was examining irregularities in FTX account balances. Concurrently, Nansen’s Martin Lee observed significant withdrawals from FTX accounts.

                              <span>Pro-XRP legal expert John Deaton has again come for the US Securities and Commission’s (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler in its battle against Ripple. This time, he questions Gensler’s competence and calls for his dismissal from the Commission.
 
Gensler Doesn’t Know What Security Means
 
In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Deaton stated that despite his academic experience, Gensler doesn’t have a “clue” about what investment contracts (also known as security) mean. He further stated that Gensler continues to feign ignorance that securities laws cannot apply to the “purchase of an asset for non-investment use cases.”
 
 
Deaton was reacting to an old clip where Gensler mentioned that Ether had transformed from a security to a non-security as it had become more decentralized. …</span>

                              <span>Nine years ago today, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange made his most substantial public remarks on the nature of Bitcoin, a then five-year-old project that had just broken into the financial mainstream by passing $1,000 the year prior.
At that time, Assange was not new to Bitcoin. In fact, Wikileaks had discussed accepting Bitcoin since as far back as 2010, when early efforts were made by users to introduce the journalistic agency to the payment method.
Ultimately, Wikileaks began accepting Bitcoin in 2011, a move the organization has since credited for helping break its banking blockade in the wake of its publishing of classified U.S. government information. 
That said, a 2014 interview, unearthed by Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo, shows Assange was every bit as convinced about the technolo…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin rose above the $28,000 level on Monday, as bullish sentiment returned to start what many are calling the month of “Uptober.” The global crypto market cap was also considerably higher in today’s session, up nearly 3% as of writing. Ethereum remains above $1,700.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) started the month trading above the $28,000 level, as traders came in strong to begin “Uptober.”
 
Following a low of $27,056.29 on Sunday, BTC/USD rose to a peak of $28,488.74 earlier in today’s session.
 
This surge pushed bitcoin to its strongest point since August 17, when price was trading at a high of $28,751.

From the chart, the latest rise in momentum comes following a breakout at the 68.00 level on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 69.44, which is marginally below a higher ceiling of 70.00.
 
Should the indicator move beyond this point, BTC will enter overbought territory, which could be a signal to bears to reenter the market.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) continued to trade above the $1,700 level on Monday, as the cryptocurrency hovered near a multi-week high of its own.
 
ETH/USD hit an intraday high of $1,750.60 to start the week, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,670.08.
 
Similar to bitcoin, this rally has seen ethereum trade at its highest level since mid-August, after breaking out of a resistance point at $1,730.

A closer look at the chart will also show that an upward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages has occurred.
 
This typically is a bullish signal, however with ethereum’s RSI also close to being overbought, traders might be tentative before opting to amplify pressure.

This revelation comes in the form of an email, hitherto undisclosed, bearing the date of August 22, 2008. The email, directed to computer scientist Wei Dai, offers a captivating window into the nascent stages of Bitcoin’s creation, a journey that would go on to profoundly alter the contours of the global financial realm.
 
This recently unveiled correspondence serves as a valuable historical artifact, shedding light on the intellectual exchanges and collaborative efforts that paved the way for the development of Bitcoin.

                              <span>Coinbase, one of the world&#x27;s largest Bitcoin and crypto exchanges, has received approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to offer Bitcoin buying and selling services to both retail and institutional investors in the country.
This milestone makes official Coinbase&#x27;s expansion into the Singaporean market, which has been gradually embracing Bitcoin as an investment option.
The approval granted by MAS enables Coinbase to provide a secure and regulated platform for Singaporean investors to access Bitcoin, and comes on the heels of its approvals in Europe last week. 
Coinbase&#x27;s expansion comes at a critical juncture for the company. Since its high-profile IPO in 2021, Coinbase has faced challenges in maintaining its share price amid a volatile crypto market. The company&#x27;s stock initially surged post-IPO but has since experienced fluctuations in line with the broader cryptocurrency market.
Coinbase&#x27;s expansion into Singapore aligns with its mission to make cryptocurrencies more accessible and user-friendly for individuals and institutions worldwide. The exchange&#x27;s reputation for regulatory compliance and security is expected to play a pivotal role in gaining the trust of Singaporean investors.
The move also reflects the broader trend of crypto exchanges seeking regulatory approval and compliance as they expand their services to cater to a wider audience. This approach not only enhances investor protection but also contributes to the legitimacy of the cryptocurrency industry.
Further it follows the exchange&#x27;s recent promised addition of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, a second-layer solution designed to improve the scalability and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions.</span>

The government of Brazil announced the implementation of a nationwide blockchain-based ID card that will centralize the identity function of all states. Selected states, including Goias, Parana, and Rio de Janeiro, will begin issuing the National Identity Card immediately, with all states having to adopt it by November 6.

                              <span>The founder of the darknet marketplace Silk Road which dealt exclusively with Bitcoin, Ross Ulbricht, recently announced that he had spent 10 years in prison. Despite his fraudulent actions, Ulbricht is a popular figure in the crypto community as he is believed to have contributed to the accelerated adoption of the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. 
 
Silk Road And Bitcoin Adoption
 
Silk Road was an online black platform that was used to facilitate illegal activities, including drug trade and money laundering. Interestingly, Bitcoin was the only currency used to facilitate these transactions, as Ulbricht is said to have been a huge proponent of the flagship cryptocurrency.
 
 
According to Ulbricht’s mother, her son created the Silk Road with the intention of providing a “truly free marke…</span>

                              <span>The cryptocurrency  
world is dealing with a very concerning trend. In September 2023, a staggering $329.8  
million was stolen in crypto-related exploits, emerging as the  
most devastating month so far this year.
Phishing,  
Scams, and Hacks Drain $1.34 Billion in 2023
The blockchain  
security firm CertiK has identified the primary contributor to this huge sum as  
the Mixin Network attack on September 23. During this incident, the Hong  
Kong-based decentralized cross-chain transfer protocol suffered a severe breach  
of its cloud service provider, which resulted in losses amounting to $200 million.
Other  
notable incidents in September included attacks on the CoinEx exchange and  
Stake.com. Those two incidents led to losses of $53 million and $41 million,  
respectively. The

                              <span>The saga surrounding self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor Craig Wright may soon come to an end. After years of legal disputes and various court cases, Craig Wright is in danger of losing his last allies. After Christen Ager-Hanssen left nChain Group on Saturday, a leaked email suggests that Calvin Ayre, another once-strong supporter and financier, is also distancing himself from Wright.
 
Doubts Surrounding Wright’s Satoshi Claims Intensify
 
Christen Ager-Hanssen, who until Saturday held the position of Group CEO at nChain Global, made waves with his public announcement of departure. His statements not only shed light on the internal dynamics and discord within nChain but also cast significant doubts on Wright’s claims of being the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto.
