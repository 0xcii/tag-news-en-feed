                              <span>The NEAR Foundation announced a restructuring that will see its workforce slashed by 40%, which is about 35 members of its staff. This decision, which comes despite the expansion within the NEAR ecosystem in 2023, is aimed at streamlining operations for greater efficiency and impact, according to the announcement.
 
Reason Behind NEAR Foundation Workforce Slash
 
Illia Polosukhin, CEO of the NEAR Foundation, indicated that the adjustments are part of a “calculated” move to “bolster” the foundation’s effectiveness in key areas.
 
 
According to the announcement, the restructuring will mainly affect the marketing, business development, and community teams. Polosukhin assured that the NEAR Foundation’s treasury “remains strong and well-managed,” indicating the organization’s alleged solid fin…</span>

The asset manager and Wood herself have been long-term supporters of the cryptocurrency.
 
 
All About Bitcoin, Wood Has Skin In The Game
 
In an interview with the Schwab Network, the asset manager revealed how much of her network has been allocated to Bitcoin. Wood said around 25% of her net worth was converted into BTC.
 
However, the asset manager founder clarified that this estimation is a “rough” guess, meaning more or less of this percentage could be Bitcoin. More specifically, Wood stated:

Ripple Isn’t Dumping XRP Tokens On The Market
 
In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Schwartz clarified that the figures showing that Ripple’s monthly XRP sales increased about three times in December are inaccurate. He alluded to the next XRP Markets Report, which will help dispel these rumors, as he stated that it will include Ripple’s aggregate holdings of XRP over the quarter.
