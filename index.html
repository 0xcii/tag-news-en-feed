Donald Trump’s Advice on U.S. Default
 
Former President and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has advised Republican lawmakers to let the United States default on its debt obligations if Democrats do not agree to spending cuts.
 
Trump was asked during a televised CNN Town Hall on Wednesday for his advice to Republicans on the possibility of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations. He said:

However, Antoni Trenchev, Nexo&#x27;s Co-Founder,

Who Will Replace Elon Musk As Twitter CEO?
 
According to a Tweet posted via his official handle, Elon Musk will step down from his role in the next 6 weeks. However, the entrepreneur will remain in the company in a different position:

                              <span>When Web3 bug bounty platform Immunefi launched two years ago, CEO and founder Mitchell Amador says the bug bounties weren&#x27;t great and adoption was slow. But the tides started to turn because even if exploiting a smart contract nets a bigger payday than a bounty, it comes with a huge drawback. &quot;There&#x27;s a ton of risk when you engage in this, you know, wantonly criminal behavior and steal $200 million from someone else,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s no way someone&#x27;s not going to come looking.&quot;</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s no doubt that the SEC dealt Kraken—and the outlook for crypto staking products in the U.S.—a big blow when it announced a $30 million settlement and ordered the company to stop offering the service to its customers in the states in February. Now Marco Santori, the company&#x27;s chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: &quot;Kraken&#x27;s master account application has not yet been rejected.&quot;</span>
