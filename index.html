                              <span>A recent Bloomberg report sheds light on the predictions of Reggie Browne, the head of ETF trading at market-maker GTS, regarding the trading dynamics of a Bitcoin ETF’s potential approval on Wednesday. 
 
Bitcoin ETF Applications Poised For ‘Meaningful’ Premium?
 
Per the report, Browne suggests that if approved, the ETF applications by the asset managers could trade at a meaningful premium to its net asset value (NAV), potentially reaching an 8% premium. 
 
The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which holds Bitcoin futures, has maintained an average premium of 0.02% over the past year. 
 
 
However, Browne warns about the complexity of trading spot Bitcoin directly and the challenges it may pose for ETF price alignment with the underlying Bitcoin.

Gary Gensler’s Advice to Crypto Investors
 
The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, released another statement regarding crypto investing Tuesday, amid market expectations of imminent approval for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
 
In a post on social media platform X, Gensler urged investors to be cautious if they are considering an investment involving crypto assets. He warned: “Crypto asset s…</span>

In a post on X, Alfred also noted that MicroStrategy is down 5% and is trading as “if the market expects the spot ETFs to be approved soon.”
 
MicroStrategy’s Premium Will Fall, MSTR Prices Will Drop
 
Despite the expected reduction in MicroStrategy’s premium, Alfred believes its stock price, currently trading at around $600, may recover steadily in the next bull run. 
 
 
Looking at the MSTR stock in the daily chart, prices appear to be topping out. Share prices rose to as high as $717 in the first week of January before dropping 16% to spot rates. The sell-off continues when writing with critical primary support…</span>

Bitcoin Holders In Profit Have Crossed The 90% Mark Now
 
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the BTC holders in profit have climbed up following the asset’s swift move above the $46,000 level.

                              <span>Bitcoin’s value experienced a turbulent Tuesday, largely due to a rogue post from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s hijacked X account, mistakenly proclaiming the green light for all spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

This erroneous message from the official Twitter of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sparked a rapid increase in bitcoin’s price, soaring close to $48,000 per unit. Yet, this surge was short-lived as the price promptly dropped to around $45,000 once the market recognized the false nature of the announcement.

                              <span>Caitlin Long, the founder of Custodia Bank, is sounding the alarm about the race by spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) issuers in the United States to slash fees to near zero. Taking to X on January 8, the founder urged clients planning to buy these regulated products to be cautious about these ultra-low fees, as they could indicate hidden risks.
 
The Spot Bitcoin ETF Fee Race Is A Concern
 
Long points to the recent news that Ark Invest, one of the multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applicants, is offering a fee of 0.25%. The decision to further slash fees follows BlackRock’s move to drop theirs to as low as 0.30%. 
 
In response, the founder analyzed that clients should be critical, especially when fees are lower than costs. Most importantly, Long continued, prospective clients should ask h…</span>

However, minutes later, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler claimed that the agency’s social media account was compromised and the post was unauthorized. Some suspect an internal SEC error behind the premature bitcoin ETF announcement.
 
SEC’s ‘Unauthorized’ Spot Bitcoin ETF Announcement
 
Amidst soaring anticipation for potential spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, an official U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) account on social media platform X announced on Tuesday that the regulator has approved spot bitcoin ETFs for trading on all registered national securities exchanges.

One of those who have chipped in their two cents is former SEC chairman Jay Clayton who believes that the Spot ETF is a matter of when and not if.
 
Spot Bitcoin ETF Is Inevitable
 
The former SEC chairman joined CNBC on its famous ‘Squawk Box’ show where he shared his expectations for the 13 pending Bitcoin Spot ETF applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unlike some who have taken a more conservative stance, Clayton has chosen to go the route of absolute certainty.

                              <span>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  
encountered a significant stir as its Twitter account appeared to announce  
approvals for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) prematurely. 
However, contrary to the tweet&#x27;s assertion, SEC  
Chair Gary Gensler confirmed that no spot Bitcoin ETF applications had received  
approval as of Tuesday afternoon. The regulator&#x27;s official statement debunked  
the tweet due to an account compromise, underscoring that the SEC had not  
endorsed the listing or trading of such ETFs.

The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.
— Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) January 9, 2024
Despite this incident, expectations loom for the  
SEC&#x27;s future approval of spot Bitcoin ETF applications, though no such approval  
had transpired by the time of the compromised tweet. 
The SEC&#x27;s Statement
Gensler took to his Twitter account to clarify the  
misunderstanding, affirming the lack of authorization to spot Bitcoin ETFs. The  
SEC&#x27;s spokesperson echoed this sentiment via email, categorically denying the  
legitimacy of the tweet that circulated misinformation regarding Bitcoin ETF  
approvals.
Similarly, the SEC&#x27;s Twitter account highlighted the fuss caused by the manipulated announcement about approving the Bitcoin ETFs. Its official statement, arising from a compromised account, firmly stated that the SEC didn&#x27;t support or approve the trading or listing of these ETFs.

The @SECGov X account was compromised, and an unauthorized post was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.

Ripple CTO Addresses Community Concerns
 
An XRP community member with the handle “GDP.Burn the escrow” has voiced out concerns regarding the stagnant growth of XRP, the native token behind the Ripple network. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), the community member directly questioned Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, David Schwartz asking if Ripple’s core business was “dumping?”

Fake Post Claims Bitcoin ETF Approval
 
SEC Chair Gary Gensler addressed the situation, clarifying that the SEC’s X account had indeed been compromised, and the tweet was not legitimate. Gensler emphasized that the SEC had not granted approval for the listing and trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Gensler stated:
 

The SEC twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.

                              <span>Charles Gasparino, FOX Business Senior Correspondent, has reported that the long-anticipated Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are indeed a &quot;done deal,&quot; with trading slated to commence this Thursday. 



This confirmation from FOX Business cements earlier speculations, affirming that the final green light for Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been granted, signaling an imminent leap into the regulated investment sphere for Bitcoin.
The potential commencement of trading on Thursday would mark a watershed moment for the Bitcoin industry, providing a gateway for both institutional and retail investors to access BTC exposure through traditional financial instruments.
It is important to note that the SEC has not yet officially approved any spot Bitcoin ETFs at the time of writing. But with the approval or denial decision due tomorrow, it is expected by industry experts that the ETFs will be approved.
As the countdown begins towards tomorrows expected approval and Thursdays potential launch, anticipation builds among market participants, eager to witness this historic milestone that is poised to reshape the dynamics of Bitcoin investments and potentially pave the way for further institutional adoption of Bitcoin.</span>
