                              <span>Bitcoin Maxis are patting themselves on the back after the launch of the Taproot Assets protocol for Bitcoin and Lightning. And they’re quite right to do so. 
Lightning Labs mainnet Alpha launch last month was big news. Up till now Ethereum and Tron dominated smart contracts. Now with this latest protocol Bitcoin is poised to challenge their dominance and bring new vigor to the network. This new feature will equip developers with the tools needed to make Bitcoin a multi-asset network, enabling users to hold real-world assets like gold on the Bitcoin blockchain, marking a critical moment for Bitcoin’s evolution.
But Lightning&#x27;s Taproot Assets have even wider consequences than what they initially received hype for. With the next bull run warming up on the sidelines, the demand for diverse us…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin has seen a rebound back above the $43,000 level during the past day. Here’s a possible reason behind this reversal in the asset.
 
Bitcoin Has Rebounded Back Towards The $43,000 Mark
 
Just earlier, Bitcoin had plunged to a low of $40,500 as the market had witnessed some significant selling pressure. In the past day, however, BTC has already turned itself around, as it has recovered back above the $43,000 level.
 
 
The below chart shows the rollercoaster the cryptocurrency has gone through in the last few days:
 

 
 
As is usually the case, the other assets in the sector have also followed in the original cryptocurrency’s lead and turned themselves around, seeing surges of their own.
 
Due to this sharp market-wide surge, the futures side has seen a large amount of liquidations, …</span>

                              <span>On Tuesday, Montenegro’s appeals court overturned the extradition request for Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon. This reversal follows reports that Justice Minister Andrej Milovic had informally agreed to the extradition.
 
Kwon to Remain in Montenegro, Decision Lies With Justice Minister
 
For the time being, Kwon is set to stay in Montenegro, as the Appeals Court Council, on Dec. 14, overturned the Higher Court in Podgorica’s decision to extradite him to the United States. The case has now been remanded to the lower court for a fresh evaluation and ruling.
 
The court’s decision to halt Kwon’s extradition was invalidated due to a violation of specific legal protocols as per the Montenegrin Criminal Procedure Code. Notably, the court exceeded its jurisdiction. In Montenegro, a court’s function in extradition matters is merely to verify the legal grounds for such a request.
 
However, the power to actually suspend or defer the extradition of the ex-CEO of Terraform Labs is not within the court’s remit. This responsibility is solely vested in the Minister of Justice, following the Montenegrin legislation on international legal assistance in criminal matters. Here, the appeals court made a decision beyond its legal capacity, necessitating the annulment.
 
 
Confronting significant legal challenges from both the U.S. and South Korea, Kwon has unwaveringly refuted all allegations of fraud. His charges, filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and South Korean financial authorities, include commodities fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit fraud and manipulate the market. The ultimate decision to approve or deny Kwon’s extradition lies with the Justice Minister.

                              <span>Thanks to a significant increase in transaction fees that have risen to their highest peaks since April 2021, bitcoin miners are currently enjoying a windfall of previously unheard-of revenues.
 
The reason for this unusual increase in transaction costs is that Ordinals inscriptions are becoming more and more common in the blockchain network.
 
Bitcoin Network Activity Soars, And So Do Fees
 
The need to handle transactions on the Bitcoin network has increased significantly as the Ordinals inscriptions become more visible.
 
Due to the significant increase in transaction fees brought about by this spike in demand, mining has become a profitable industry for all parties involved.

NitroBetting.eu, a prominent Bitcoin-exclusive sportsbook, just released the first-of-their-kind Bitcoin Spot ETF betting lines. The new prediction market is focused on the SEC’s potential Spot ETF approval date, as well as speculation on which ETF sponsor will be the first to receive approval. According to the published odds, the market thinks it more likely than not that the SEC approves a Spot BTC ETF by 1/10/2024, with odds sitting at -1667 for, and +650 against.
With regard to ETF sponsors, at the time of writing, simultaneous approval for multiple applicants is the most favored scenario (-250), with Blackrock leading the pack as most favored for standalone approval (+120). Of all the potential Spot ETF sponsors, Wisdomtree (+2900) and Invesco (+2900) are the leas…</span>

                              <span>Solana is in the lead again, as the majority of crypto assets investment products witnessed net outflows of investments last week, bringing an end to 11 consecutive weeks of inflows. This wasn’t surprising though, as most cryptocurrencies went through a brief period of consolidation and profit-taking last week. 
 
According to the latest report from CoinShares, digital asset investment products saw minor outflows of $16 million last week, with the majority of the outflows coming from Bitcoin. However, despite the outflows, Solana picked up steam, with its net inflow jumping 240% percent from the previous week.

decision allowing for the extradition of Do Kwon, the Former CEO of Terra, to  
either the United States or South Korea. Instead, Kwon has been granted an  
appeal against this matter based on a procedural error. 
According to a report by Coindesk, citing documents  
shared by the court on Tuesday, the judge overseeing the case  
failed to grant Kwon the opportunity to present his stance regarding the  
extradition request from the United States. This is a mandatory step provided  
in the law.  
This oversight led to the successful appeal by  
Kwon&#x27;s defense, redirecting the case to the Podgorica Basic Court for a
