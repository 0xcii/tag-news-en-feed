But the community consensus model of Bitcoin is essential for ongoing censorship resistance. While it’s not easy to get tens of thousands of individual computers to agree, getting thousands of humans to agree is arguably the greater challenge.”
As a Bitcoin Core developer, Uttarwar is understandably fascinated with Bitcoin’s unique consensus model. She opted to focus on this community-led, open-source project full time in 2019, taking a significant pay cut from an engineering role with Coin…</span>

                              <span>Litecoin was back above $80.00 on Wednesday, as the token climbed away from a recent six-week low. Today’s rise in price sees the cryptocurrency surge for a third straight day, despite recent market volatility. Cardano was also marginally higher.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) jumped back above $80.00 earlier in today’s session, as the token continued to move away from recent lows.
 
Following yesterday’s low of $78.18, LTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $81.97 on Thursday.
 
The surge saw litecoin rise from a recent six-week low of $75.32, which took the cryptocurrency to a breakout of a floor at $77.00.
 
 
Looking at the chart, today’s rally pushed the relative strength index (RSI) towards a resistance level of 39.00.
 
At the time of writing, the index is currently tracking at 37.95, with LTC falling from earlier highs, and trading at $80.84.
 
Bulls in the market are likely targeting a ceiling of $85.00, however there will likely be some hurdles in the form upcoming points of resistance.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was also marginally higher, as prices traded close to a key support level on Wednesday.
 
ADA/USD hit a high of $0.3727 earlier in the day, which comes following a bottom at $0.3574 during yesterday’s session.
 
Thursday’s marginal gain sees cardano climb above a price floor of $0.3580, however earlier momentum has somewhat faded.
 
 
It appears that gains have eased due to the RSI colliding with a ceiling at the 41.00 mark.
 
Price strength is now at the 37.06 level, after failing to break out of the aforementioned resistance.
 
ADA is now trading at $0.3613, with bearish pressure significantly higher than earlier in the day.

                              <span>On May 7, 2023, the Bitcoin network was plagued with an overwhelming 500,000 unconfirmed transactions, causing a major bottleneck in the system. However, the good news is that the congestion has been clearing, resulting in a significant reduction in onchain fees, which have now dropped below $5. As of now, there are only slightly over 300,000 unconfirmed transactions awaiting confirmation, and 185 blocks need to be mined to clear the backlog.
 
Bitcoin Backlog Begins to Gradually Subside
 
Bitcoin has been the talk of the town lately, as it grapples with the challenge of meeting the demand for block space. Just four days ago, the mempool, which is the queue of unconfirmed bitcoin transactions, hit an all-time high, with over 500,000 unconfirmed transfers waiting to be processed.

                              <span>Many notable figures, including Coinbase CEO Armstrong, have raised concerns regarding the regulatory uncertainty in the US crypto industry. They even emphasized its impact on innovation, investment opportunities, and job loss.
 
According to Ripple policy head Susan Friedman, crypto industry players are escaping the US to regions like Dubai with clear regulatory guidelines. In her tweet, Friedman noted that these migrations could severely impact jobs and investment in the United States.
 
Unclear Regulatory Guideline Affects American Innovation And Competitiveness
 
Susan Friedman reacted to a post by the Republicans of the US House Committee on Financial Services regarding the impacts of the SEC’s regulation by enforcement.

                              <span>Ethereum fell below $1,800 in today’s session, as markets continued to react to the latest U.S. consumer price index. Inflation in the United States fell to 4.9% in April, less than the 5% sum many had expected. Bitcoin was also lower on the data, falling below $27,000.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dropped below $27,000 late on Wednesday, as markets reacted to the latest U.S. inflation report.
 
After an earlier high of $28,322.69, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $26,883.67 towards the close of yesterday’s session.
 
This move saw bitcoin drop to its weakest point since March 28, when price was at a low of $26,640.
 
 
Since this earlier decline in price, BTC has since rebounded, and is currently trading at $27,494.24.
 
From the chart, this appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI), which is now tracking at 41.91, and close to reentering a floor at 43.00.
 
Should this occur, there is a strong possibility that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could be back above $28,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Additionally, ethereum (ETH) also fell to a multi-week low in today’s session, dropping below $1,800 in the process.
 
ETH/USD slipped to a bottom at $1,795.67 late on Wednesday, following an earlier peak of $1,886.80.
 
As a result of the sell-off, the cryptocurrency dropped to its lowest level since April 26, however price has since rebounded.
 
 
One of the catalysts for the sell-off was a breakout which took place on the RSI, which saw the index fall below 45.00.
 
At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 43.93, with ethereum now trading at a price of $1,824.22.
 
It appears that a crossover between the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages will likely occur, and could signal a reversal in momentum.

                              <span>This is an opinion editorial by Peter Bistoletti, a Bitcoiner who has lived in Sweden since 1971.
Sweden is the nightmare example of a state destroying financial privacy, winning the war on cash and having control of all financial transactions. Sweden has almost completely abolished anonymous cash transactions and, as a result, its regulators have control of all financial assets. Since at least 1971, when I moved to Sweden, bank assets have to be reported annually to the tax authorities, which can also demand documentation for all bank transactions. Since 2020, the Swedish police have the right by law to acquire access to locked iphones and computers by use of force. 
In such a privacy-averse environment, one should consider Bitcoin as a better alternative.

                              <span>When Web3 bug bounty platform Immunefi launched two years ago, CEO and founder Mitchell Amador says the bug bounties weren&#x27;t great and adoption was slow. But the tides started to turn because even if exploiting a smart contract nets a bigger payday than a bounty, it comes with a huge drawback. &quot;There&#x27;s a ton of risk when you engage in this, you know, wantonly criminal behavior and steal $200 million from someone else,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s no way someone&#x27;s not going to come looking.&quot;</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s no doubt that the SEC dealt Kraken—and the outlook for crypto staking products in the U.S.—a big blow when it announced a $30 million settlement and ordered the company to stop offering the service to its customers in the states in February. Now Marco Santori, the company&#x27;s chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: &quot;Kraken&#x27;s master account application has not yet been rejected.&quot;</span>
