According to a press release on April 17th, the UAE is more proactive in regulating digital currencies within its borders.
 
 
It is now mandatory for crypto firms wanting to operate in the UAE to acquire a license from the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA). The SCA has directed that all virtual-asset service providers (VASPs) in the country, except those already licensed in UAE’s financial-free zones, apply for approval.

Coinbase is considering establishing itself in another country should the United State’s negative regulatory stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continue, according to CEO Brian Armstrong.
“I think if a number of years go by where we don’t see regulatory clarity emerge in the US, we may have to consider investing more in other regions of the world,” Armstrong reportedly said in response to a question at a fintech conference Tuesday.

Armstrong argues that without such laws, firms may be forced to develop in “offshore havens,” where they may be subject to less oversight and regulation.
 
According to a Reuters report, Armstrong made the comments during a conference held by the Innovate Finance industry body, citing the failure of the Bahamas-based FTX exchange last year as evidence of the need for clearer regulations.

Additionally, a lawsuit initiated by New York attorney general Letitia James against Kucoin insists that ethereum is also an unregistered security.

                              <span>Anthony Scaramucci of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital got burned by Sam Bankman-Fried: he co-hosted SALT conferences with FTX and sold a 30% stake in SkyBridge to FTX Ventures. And yet &quot;The Mooch&quot; tells Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott &quot;I&#x27;m more bullish now than I have ever been&quot; on crypto as an investment case. He discusses his frustration with SBF, how wrong he thinks politicians like Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler are about crypto and how to regulate it, what he sees happening next with adoption, and talks about Trump.

                              <span>Toronto-based Bitcoin mining company Hut 8 recently announced a merger with U.S. Bitcoin Corp that will take it into Texas, Nebraska, and New York. Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton joined Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott to talk expanding into the U.S., dealing with regulatory pushback post-FTX, why Texas is such a hotspot, and where she&#x27;d like to expand globally down the road (the climates may surprise you).

                              <span>Gnosis first launched in 2015 as a decentralized prediction market built on Ethereum. Now it&#x27;s a DAO, a multi-sig wallet, a staking chain, and a vibrant community with its own GNO governance token. Co-founder and COO Friederike Ernst talked to Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott about the careful evolution of Gnosis, decentralization impostors, account abstraction, DeFi UX failures, why Ethereum is the &quot;Manhattan of crypto,&quot; and much more.
