When writing on August 17, XRP is down 10% while DOGE is dumping even harder, losing 13% in the last seven trading days. 
 
The Altcoin Sell-off
 
At this rate, XRP and DOGE match MATIC, down 13%, and SHIB, the Shiba Inu’s native token, fell 15% in the same time frame. The sell-off of these altcoins is noticeable and comes amid encouraging fundamental developments. 
 
 
What’s also evident is that traders are dumping DOGE and SHIB, two of the most valuable meme coins, and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens at a relatively higher pace than other coins. Ap…</span>

Bitcoin Is Oversold, Will It Recover?
 
Highlighting candlestick arrangements in the 4-hour chart, the Chartered Market Analyst argues that the current BTC prices are grossly oversold. Drawing parallels with historical occurrences, he points out that the last time Bitcoin was this “oversold” in the 4HR chart, the coin went on to surge 63%. 
 
 
With Bitcoin currently trading around $27,800, it could roar to $45,000 for a 63% surge if history repeats itself. In this case, the coin will ease past immediate resistance levels, quickly printing new 202…</span>

The decision, based on a review of the parties’ letters dated August 9 and 16, 2023, marks a significant milestone in the case.
 
The SEC’s successful request means that the regulatory body now has the opportunity to present a compelling case to the Second Circuit.
 
 However, it’s important to note that Judge Torres has only granted permission for the SEC to file the motion for an interlocutory appeal.

                              <span>Since mid-July, Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, has encountered significant challenges in its price action following a remarkable climb to a new yearly high. 
 
However, in a matter of days, the market momentum shifted, leading to an uphill battle for bulls as they fought to defend critical support levels and prevent further declines. 
 
Nevertheless, their efforts proved insufficient, as Bitcoin has now breached the crucial $28,000 mark and its 50-day Moving Average (MA), which was previously regarded as a robust support line for the digital asset. 
 
This ongoing downtrend has intensified, with mounting selling pressure exacerbating the situation for Bitcoin.

SHIB Burn Up 64%
 
The stats for Wednesday are in and SHIB looks to be doing well in the burn department. According to burn tracker Shibburn, the total number of tokens burned in the 24-hour period came out 64.77% higher than that of the previous day.
 
 
For more accurate figures, the website shows a total of 357,075,351 tokens burned on August 16, with the number picking up following the launch of Shibarium. The majority of the burn came f…</span>

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has crossed the first step in its effort to  
appeal a trial court’s ruling that crypto firm Ripple’s XRP token sale on digital asset exchanges is not a  
security offering. Judge Analisa Torres has granted the securities  
watchdog&#x27;s request to file a motion that will enable it to further argue for

reported today (Thursday).
SEC Moves  
to Seek Appeal
An  
interlocutory appeal involves challenging a decision made by a lower court  
before the case concludes. Not all such appeals are permitted, and the  
appealing party must demonstrate that the decision could greatly influence the
