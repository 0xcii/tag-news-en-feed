                              <span>Singapore has disowned the activities of the collapsed  
cryptocurrency project Terraform Labs, saying the platform was not performing  
activities requiring a license from MAS and was neither licensed nor exempted  
from licensing by the regulator. The City state has also downplayed the impact  
of the Terraform Labs saga on its financial systems.
Responding to a question by a member of parliament,  
Lawrence Wong, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Chairman  
of MAS, said that the collapse of Terraform Labs sparked concerns about  
regulatory oversight and investor protection in the cryptocurrency market. The  
event has prompted Singaporean authorities to reevaluate and reinforce  
regulations to mitigate risks in the crypto space.

                              <span>Bitcoin is looking to enter into the $65,000 price terrain again amidst price volatility in the past 24 hours. The latest numbers from two different metrics suggest this could become a reality soon and Bitcoin could be on track to going on a price rally. As noted by a crypto analyst on social media, the Bitcoin funding rate and basis points to a “leg up.” 
 
Bitcoin Is Getting Ready
 
According to a post on social media by Will Clemente, a popular crypto analyst, both the funding rate and 3-month annualized basis for Bitcoin are starting to cool off after briefly reaching negative readings in the past few weeks. What this means is that long-position trades for the asset are starting to dominate as investors regain confidence in its potential price action in the coming weeks.

The rift deepened following a blog post penned by Binance&#x27;s

Evolution Of Account Abstraction On Ethereum
 
Ethereum’s account model includes two primary types: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts. EOAs are controlled by private keys and have limited capabilities and security features, which restrict their use in more complex transactions typically reserved for smart contracts.

accuses Ronaldo of endorsing Binance, which allegedly led investors into making costly and risky

Ronaldo&#x27;s Motion Denied in Binance NFT Lawsuit
Judge Roy Altman&#x27;s ruling, issued on May 4, followed a  
request from the plaintiffs to stay proceedings until a ruling on a motion to  
compel arbitration. Simultaneously, the judge denied Ronaldo&#x27;s motion to  
dismiss the case, stating: &quot;We deny without prejudice the Defendant&#x27;s 29 motion

                              <span>Nigeria’s once-tepid stance on cryptocurrency has taken a sharp turn towards prohibition. The Nigerian government, citing concerns over Naira manipulation, is proposing a ban on P2P (Peer-to-Peer) trading platforms that utilize the local currency. This move, coupled with ongoing legal battles with major exchanges, throws the future of Nigerian crypto into uncertainty.
 
 
Naira Under Siege? The P2P Battleground
 
The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleges that crypto participants and exchanges are manipulating the Naira’s value through P2P transactions. Emomotimi Agama, the newly appointed Director-General, suggests delisting the Naira from all P2P platforms as a remedy.
 
Agama highlighted the government’s resolve to combat the perceived threat, saying:

                              <span>Regulatory change in the crypto realm has been a subject of heated debate for many years. The general ethos of cryptocurrency is one of anarchism or anarcho-capitalism. Proponents of the tech tend to be adamantly against any type of governmental intervention into markets or technology.
However, as digital assets and blockchain technology find themselves thrust into the mainstream, governments must respond. They must either incorporate these assets into existing regulations or create a new regulatory framework altogether.  
Lets look at how crypto regulations have evolved over the years, with a focus on US regulation.
Background: Crypto Regulation in the US
