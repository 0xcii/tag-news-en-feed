                              <span>FTX disintegrated in November last year which then led to a cascade of events that exacerbated the already struggling crypto market. 
 
The failed exchange is again hogging the headlines as FTX reports more than $415 million worth of crypto was hacked. 
 
According to recent reports, the exchange recovered more than $5 billion worth of liquid assets which would then be used to pay off creditors.
 
Some $2 million in cryptocurrency belonging to the hedge firm Alameda Research was also stolen, the company disclosed in a statement.
 
However, with this being the most recent hack that happened on the platform, will it affect the trust of creditors?

A top official at the Financial Services Agency explained that the recent FTX implosion wasn’t brought on by crypto technology but by “loose governance, lax internal controls, and the absence of regulation and supervision.”
 
Bank-Level Cryptocurrency Regulations
 
Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country’s top financial regulator, has urged regulators globally to subject cryptocurrency exchanges to bank-level regulations, Bloomberg reported Monday. Mamoru Yanase, deputy director-general of the FSA’s Strategy Development and Management Bureau, was quoted as saying:

Rise in Ethereum Value Leads to Increased Onchain Transaction Costs
 
Sending ethereum (ETH) is becoming more costly as the crypto asset’s value has risen greatly over the last 14 days. At the time of writing, ether is trading at $1,542 per unit, after reaching a high of $1,606 per unit during the same 24-hour period on Jan. 18, 2023.

An independent bitcoin rally or a high-beta move? Either way, bitcoin holders are celebrating the latest action to start 2023. Bitcoin has shown some significant momentum and has powered through every key short-term price level across daily moving averages and on-chain realized prices. In fact, every major high-beta play in the market is showing the same strength which gives us more caution than confidence in t…</span>

                              <span>The new grant, in partnership with Paradigm, will bring Okcoin’s support of Bitcoin Core development to $1.5 million.
Cryptocurrency exchange Okcoin, alongside partner investment firm Paradigm, has announced a new set of funding for Bitcoin Core contribution. 
The funds will be directed into a grant for Core maintainer Marco Falke, who Okcoin has supported in the past, in 2021 and in 2020. Okcoin has also previously provided support for Lightning developer Antoine Riard in a bid to support the second-layer network’s privacy.
“Falke is one of six people in the world with the ability to approve or deny proposed changes to the code underlying the world’s biggest cryptocurrency,” the announcement explains. “As a Bitcoin Core maintainer, he reviews proposed additions to the network’s code from contributors, of which there are over 400 currently active. The grant from Okcoin and Paradigm is to provide Falke with a livable income while he devotes 40+ hours per week to Bitcoin Core development — a job without a salary, given Bitcoin’s decentralized structure.”
The announcement also highlights that many Bitcoin users may not know that the developers and maintainers of Bitcoin are technically volunteers, who, due to the nature of Bitcoin, have no centralized organization to provide funding or support for their efforts. Okcoin had previously released a survey that showed that 85% of Bitcoiners care about exchanges funding Bitcoin development. 
Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang addressed this, saying that “Paradigm believes it’s our responsibility to help fund independent Bitcoin research and development … We’re pleased to provide a grant to Marco, who continues to move the network forward with his work.”
This particular contribution brings Okcoin’s total contributions to Bitcoin development funding to $1.5 million. This respectable offering to the Bitcoin network would ideally be replicated by other firms in the industry in order to support development of the technology that allows for their existence.</span>

                              <span>Speculation on ‘Crypto Twitter’ started going wild after a Department of Justice announcement early on Wednesday regarding a following press release. With very vague and non-descriptive language, the DoJ made an announcement that a press release detailing “International Crypto Enforcement Action” was to follow in the hours following the release.
 
What followed can only be described as another hilarious moment in the rarely dry atmosphere of crypto.
 
Enforcement Action… Or Something Like It 
The DoJ’s live-streamed press release took place at 17:00 UTC and leading speculation across social channels ran the gambit: could a stablecoin ban, or increased regulations, be incoming? Could a government crackdown in some regulatory fashion be impending? The announcement was, in fact, neither of th…</span>
