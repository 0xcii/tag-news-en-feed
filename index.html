                              <span>One of the U.S. and Brazil’s biggest Bitcoin ATM operators, Coin Cloud, filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on Thursday, January 8, after the firm received a severe blow from the crypto winter and the FTX implosion, which left it with millions of dollars in liabilities.
 
Coin Cloud owes about 10,000 creditors but has between $50 million and $100 million in assets, far below its debts. This imbalance in assets and liabilities has led the firm to take the bankruptcy option. At press time, Coin Cloud has nearly $500 million in liabilities, with the chief cause being its exposure to FTX through Genesis Global Trading.

Regulators Pestering The Industry?
 
Bitcoin’s slump below its $23,000 range is due to the ongoing crypto regulation rumors circulating in the industry. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that a top U.S. financial regulator is currently investigating crypto exchange Kraken over a suggestion that it breaking security rules related to certain offerings to U.S. customers.
 
Bloomberg further noted citing a person with knowledge of the matter that the investigation is at an advanced stage and could result in a settlement within the coming days.

The Challenges Faced by Localbitcoins and its Ultimate Demise in the Crypto Market
 
The first peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin exchange, Localbitcoins, is ending operations after over ten years in the business. The exchange announced the news on its website, stating that new sign-ups will be suspended as of Feb. 9, 2023, and trading will be suspended seven days later, on Feb. 16. Following the suspension of trading, Localbitcoins users will only be able to withdraw their bitcoins and have 12 months to do so.…</span>

The four indicators it uses are the total number of active addresses on the network (that is, the addresses being involved in at least 1 send/receive transaction), the number of transactions, the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) count (UTXOs are basically the amount left over in wallets after a transaction takes place…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin dropped to a two-week low on Feb. 9, with prices falling below the $23,000 mark after a brief rally on Wednesday. Cryptocurrencies moved lower across the board, as uncertainty surrounding the state of the global economy impacted investor confidence. Ethereum also slipped, following a move towards $1,700 during yesterday’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) slipped to a two-week low on Thursday, with prices falling below $23,000 in the process.
 
Following a high of $23,191.32 on hump-day, BTC/USD plunged to an intraday low of $22,458.26 in today’s session.
 
The decline sent bitcoin to its lowest level since January 26, and came as prices broke out of a key support point at $22,500.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the sell-off came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell to a one-month low, after moving below a floor of its own.
 
The index is currently tracking at 56.50, which is marginally under its recent support level at the 58.00 mark.
 
Since this bottom, bulls have moved to buy the dip, with BTC now trading at $22,701.04, as of writing.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also saw a slight resurgence snapped, with market sentiment shifting in a bearish direction.
 
ETH/USD has bottomed at $1,615.06 so far on Thursday, which comes less than 24 hours after reaching a high of $1,678.09.
 
Yesterday’s move saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency break out of a ceiling at $1,675, however it was unable to sustain this momentum.
 
 
Looking at the chart, bears seem to be targeting a floor at $1,600 for ETH, however all advances to this point have so far been rejected.
 
This comes as the RSI appears to have found a relatively stable floor at the 57.00 mark, which has given confidence to nervous bulls.
 
At the time of writing, ethereum has rebounded from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $1,632.90.

LocalBitcoins Joins The List Of Fallen Companies
 
LocalBitcoins was created ten years ago as one of the industry’s first peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading platforms. The platform enjoyed high popularity and adoption due to its low transaction fees, community, non-custodial wallet, and ability to trade anonymously. The exchange stated:
 

We have honored that mission for over 10 years and we are proud of what we have achieved together with all of you, our loyal community. We are therefore sad to share, that regardless of our …</span>

In this edition of the “Bitcoin Homesteaders Interview Series,” I spoke with Erin, who built an urban farm in the backyard of her rented apartment in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
I originally met Erin at a Bay Area Bitcoin Meetup and was struck by her wide interests — from astronomy and astrology to Bitcoin and doomsday prepping. When not tending to her farm, she’s working on a PhD in Earth and planetary science and running a podcast called “Hell Money” with Casey Rodarmor (the Ordinals guy). 
She’s also reaching kids with her adventures into urban farming via TikTok — so follow her there if you’d like to learn more about how she produces abundance out…</span>
