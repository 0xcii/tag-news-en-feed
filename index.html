Bitcoin Core patched with the Ordisrespector update, filtering out inscription transactions.

In the second part of our discussion with Dr Gabbay, an expert in financial regulation and enforcement, we learn about differing crypto approaches in the EU, whether crypto firms are still willing to do business in the US, the need for bridges between the crypto industry and traditional finance, also touching on political influence and the likelihood of approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs.

For Bitcoin maximalists, Bitcoin is Bitcoin and cryptos are altcoins, if not shitcoins. Now that Bitcoin is heading for a bull run, boosted by the 4th halving hype and Bitcoin ETF approvals, Saylor’s MicroStrategy is already over $1.2 billion in unrealized profit territory.
The Bitcoin meme maker himself wasted no time in visualizing the payoff from his Bitcoin maximalism strategy.
