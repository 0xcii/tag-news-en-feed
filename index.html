Argentina Settles Part of IMF Payment in Chinese Yuan
Argentina keeps implementing the Chinese yuan as part of its national and international economy. Besides adopting it as a recognized currency to open bank accounts due to the limited supply of U.S. dollars in the economy, the country is now using it to settle debts with international institutions.

                              <span>In a series of thought-provoking tweets, Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs, recently sparked discussions about the possibility of Ethereum functioning as a layer-2 (L2) solution for the Solana blockchain. This proposition raises interesting questions about the potential benefits and challenges associated with such an integration. In this article, we delve deeper into the considerations put forth by Yakovenko, exploring the concept of Ethereum as an L2 protocol for Solana and its implications for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.
 
Ethereum Could Be A L2 For Solana
 
Yakovenko proposes that Ethereum could function as an L2. According to him, this is “probably more likely than you might think at first glance,” adding that L2s are bridge protocols that provide one way…</span>

                              <span>Ethiopia has joined Egypt and Algeria in applying to become a member of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) economic bloc. According to the Ethiopian Foreign Affairs Ministry, joining the bloc would help the country guarantee its national interests. 
 
Safeguarding Ethiopian National Interests
 
Ethiopia, which has one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies, has become the latest African country to seek to join the Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa (BRICS) economic bloc. The North East African country, which has waged a bloody war against Tigray rebels, joins Egypt and Algeria in seeking to join BRICS.
 
According to a report in The East African, the country’s Foreign Affairs ministry believes joining a global institution such as BRICS will help advance Ethiopian national interests.
 
“As a country that has been a founding member of global institutions like the AU [African Union] and the UN [United Nations], and as we seek to guarantee our national interests, it is important to join blocs like BRICS,” the ministry reportedly said.
 
Ethiopia, like its counterpart Egypt, has grappled with shortages of foreign exchange and has seen the gap between the official and parallel market exchange rate of its currency versus the U.S. dollar widen to a record high. The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) has attempted to remedy the situation by imposing limits on the amount of U.S. dollars that residents can take outside the country.
 
However, by joining BRICS which is planning to launch an alternative reserve currency, Ethiopia hopes to reduce its dependence on the greenback. The country’s wish to join BRICS is coming at a time when some African nations are seeking to diminish the influence of the U.S. dollar in intra-continental trade.

Tim Draper’s $250K Bitcoin Price Forecast
 

 
Venture capitalist Tim Draper has adjusted the projected timeframe for his bitcoin price prediction. He tweeted Friday that when the price of bitcoin was $4,000, he predicted that it would climb 60 times and reach $250,000 by now. However, BTC ended June below $31,000. “I guess we have to wait a little longer,” he wrote, adding that it may take two more years for his $250K prediction to come true.
