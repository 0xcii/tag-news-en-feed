On March 4, prominent crypto Youtuber and influencer Lark Davis decided to think outside the box to piece up all major corporate adoption in order to back up his belief that what could happen following the 2024 Bitcoin (BTC) halving “will blow people’s minds.”
 
Increasing Corporate Crypto Adoption
 
Lark Davis, in a series of tweets published March 4, did not only try to make a point about the bear market but also made a list of major adoptions to back up the point.

                              <span>A joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC. has brought the first nuclear-powered Bitcoin mine online in Pennsylvania.
Terawulf has announced roughly half of its nuclear-powered Nautilus Cryptomine has come online. The mining facility, a joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC., derives its energy wholly from the 2.5 GW Susquehanna nuclear generation station in Pennsylvania.
The full operation will amount to 50 MW and 1.9 EH/s, with an option for Terawulf to add an additional 50 MW of bitcoin mining capacity, “which the Company plans to deploy in future phases,” according to a press release. 
Paul Prager, chairman and CEO of TeraWulf, said that “the recent energization of the Nautilus facility earlier this month, approximately 16,000 of TeraWulf’s owned miners, representing 1.9 EH/s of self-mining capacity, are onsite and being brought online daily.” 
“The Nautilus nuclear-powered mining facility benefits from what is arguably the lowest cost power in the sector, just $0.02/kWh for a term of five years,” Prager commented.
Mining consultant and cofounder of Citadel 256, Magdalena Gronowska, previously described in an article for Bitcoin Magazine how nuclear power can revolutionize Bitcoin mining.
“Nuclear is a carbon free, reliable and cheap energy source,” she told the magazine. “It&#x27;s not perfect in that it emits nuclear waste, but every energy source has tradeoffs between environmental footprint, reliability and capital and operating costs… We need a diverse mix of energy generation, to serve both baseload and peak load, as we transition to a low carbon economy.”</span>

                              <span>In recent times, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been consistently above 300 exahash per second (EH/s) as multiple mining pools dedicate significant hashpower to the Bitcoin blockchain today. Interestingly, some of the world’s top bitcoin mining pools are also using their hashrate to merge-mine other coins, and these networks have benefited from bitcoin’s increased hashrate.
 
How Bitcoin’s Hashrate Benefits Other Crypto Networks
 
Bitcoin’s hashrate secures the network and provides rewards for miners participating in the system, but mining pools also dedicate computational power to networks like Namecoin, Elastos, Emercoin, and Vcash. For example, Namecoin has a hashrate of around 187 EH/s today, and some of the top bitcoin mining pools merge-mine the network to acquire namecoin (NMC) rewards.

                              <span>Last week, news quickly circulated that Silvergate Bank, a crypto-friendly bank, was in hot water and had to stop offering USD services to its around 1,600 crypto customers. This obviously had a significant impact on the market as assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum quickly lost a good portion of their gains from January. Even now, the market continues to feel the after-effects of the Silvergate announcement, but what’s even more shocking is the fact that the USD drought from crypto firms might be deliberate.
 
Is Halting USD Transfers Deliberate?
 
In a new report, Matrixport head of research Markus Thielen highlights recent developments in the crypto space when it comes to USD transfers. The first crypto platform to succumb was the Binance exchange which announced that it would no longer…</span>

                              <span>Ethereum classic remained near a two-month low on March 6, as a cloud of uncertainty continued to hover over markets. The global crypto market cap remained bearish to start the week, and is down 0.55% at the time of writing. Litecoin also moved lower on Monday.
 
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
 
Ethereum classic (ETC) started the week trading close to a two-month low, as volatility in crypto markets remained high.
 
ETC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $19.26 on Monday, a day after trading at a peak of $20.05.
 
The move has pushed ethereum classic towards Friday’s bottom at $18.89, which was its weakest point since January 6.
 
 
Overall, today’s drop has seen ETC fall for a fifth consecutive session, down by over 8% in that period.
 
Prices are marginally higher than earlier lows, which comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a floor at 36.00
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 36.19, with the next visible floor at the 30.00 mark, in the event of a breakout.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
In addition to ethereum classic, litecoin (LTC) was another notable mover, as the token fell by as much as 4%.
 
Following a high of $91.27 on Sunday, LTC/USD dropped to a bottom at $87.15 during Monday’s session.
 
As a result of this move, litecoin moved closer to a floor at $86.00, which was last hit on Friday, and also a six-week low.
 
 
Recent declines in LTC have come following a downward crossover of the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages.
 
In addition to this, the RSI is now tracking at 40.47, which is marginally above support at 40.00.
 
Despite hovering beyond this floor, the index is at its weakest point since December 24 last year.

                              <span>Norway is putting on a major Bitcoin conference with high-signal speakers, topped off with an otherworldly rave running on Lightning.
This is an opinion editorial by Erik Dale, an organizer of the upcoming Northern Lightning Conference and host of a Scandinavian Bitcoin podcast.

Scandinavia may not be the first region that comes to mind when you think of Bitcoin, but tiny Norway has become the “biggest bitcoin mining hub in Europe.”
With less than 0.07% of world population, the Norwegians churn out nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s global hash rate, mostly thanks to cheap, stranded and renewable hydropower in the north.
And now, Norway is hosting the world’s “most Bitcoin experience” (sic): Northern Lightning 2023.
