                              <span>Ryan Salame, FTX&#x27;s Former executive serving a 7.5-year  
sentence, has retracted his legal motion to compel the government to honor his  
plea deal. The decision comes as his long-time partner, Michelle Bond, now  
faces federal charges, prompting a strategic shift in their legal approach.
Salame initially filed the motion last week, claiming  
that prosecutors had coerced him into pleading guilty by suggesting they would  
drop their investigation into Bond, the mother of his child, according to a  
petition filed before the court last week. His plea was meant to shield Bond from legal  
repercussions, but with Bond&#x27;s recent indictment on campaign finance charges,  
Salame has reconsidered his strategy.

                              <span>For years, Bitcoin enthusiasts have been expecting a significant change in the value due to the involvement of institutional investors. The concept was simple: as companies and large financial entities invest in Bitcoin, the market would experience explosive growth and a sustained period of rising prices. However, the actual outcome has been more complex. Although institutions have indeed invested substantial capital in Bitcoin, the anticipated ‘supercycle’ has not unfolded as predicted.
Institutional Accumulation
Institutional participation in Bitcoin has significantly increased in recent years, marked by substantial purchases from large companies and the introduction of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) earlier this year.

In a significant move, crypto bull and Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin has executed a notable ETH transfer, which has raised eyebrows in the general sector.
