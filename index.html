                              <span>Chainlink rallied to a three-month high during Thursday’s session, despite a red wave sweeping through cryptocurrency markets. Today’s surge came as the token broke out of a key resistance level. Dogecoin, on the other hand, was victim to today’s market sell-off, falling to a ten-day low in the process.
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) raced to a three-month high earlier in the day, as prices broke out of a key resistance level.
 
LINK/USD moved to a peak of $7.75 during Thursday’s session, which follows on from a bottom at $6.91 the day prior.
 
As a result of today’s surge, LINK jumped to its strongest point since November 8, when the token traded at a high of $9.48.
 
 
Looking at the chart, Thursday’s rally took place as bulls broke out of a ceiling at the $7.55 level.
 
The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also broke out of a resistance of its own at 59.00, and is currently tracking at 61.58.
 
Should momentum continue in this direction, traders will likely be attempting to take profits closer to the 64.00 mark on the RSI indicator.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Whilst LINK hit a multi-month high, dogecoin (DOGE) fell victim to today’s crypto red wave, with prices falling by nearly 5%.
 
Following a high of $0.09226 on Wednesday, the meme coin slipped to an intraday low of $0.08635 earlier today.
 
This resulted in DOGE moving to its weakest point since January 30, nearing a recent price floor in the process.
 
 
The aforementioned point of support is at the $0.0850 mark, which has mostly held firm since mid-January.
 
Whilst the price floor attempted to stabilize, the support of 53.00 on the RSI indicator caved in, with the index now tracking at 50.00.
 
Despite this, bulls have moved to buy this dip, with overall market momentum still marginally bullish, as can be seen on the moving averages.

                              <span>One of the U.S. and Brazil’s biggest Bitcoin ATM operators, Coin Cloud, filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on Thursday, January 8, after the firm received a severe blow from the crypto winter and the FTX implosion, which left it with millions of dollars in liabilities.
 
Coin Cloud owes about 10,000 creditors but has between $50 million and $100 million in assets, far below its debts. This imbalance in assets and liabilities has led the firm to take the bankruptcy option. At press time, Coin Cloud has nearly $500 million in liabilities, with the chief cause being its exposure to FTX through Genesis Global Trading.

Regulators Pestering The Industry?
 
Bitcoin’s slump below its $23,000 range is due to the ongoing crypto regulation rumors circulating in the industry. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that a top U.S. financial regulator is currently investigating crypto exchange Kraken over a suggestion that it breaking security rules related to certain offerings to U.S. customers.
 
Bloomberg further noted citing a person with knowledge of the matter that the investigation is at an advanced stage and could result in a settlement within the coming days.

                              <span>The new COLDCARD improves upon the Mk4 by adding a QWERTY keyboard, a big LCD screen, and a QR code scanner.
Bitcoin hardware company Coinkite is launching a new higher-end COLDCARD, featuring a full QWERTY keyboard, a larger LCD screen and a QR code scanner. The COLDCARD Q1 will also be battery-powered, removing the need for connecting the device to a power outlet or a computer.
&quot;We always wanted to make a QWERTY device for fast passphrase input with battery power,&quot; Coinkite founder NVK told Bitcoin Magazine. &quot;We&#x27;ve been toying with the QR idea for years, and we finally found a secure way of doing QR scanners. I&#x27;m very excited about this, we think this is the ultimate hardware wallet.&quot;

                              <span>Localbitcoins, the Helsinki, Finland-based bitcoin exchange founded in 2012, is closing operations after over a decade of service. The company’s operators attribute the shutdown to the “ongoing crypto-winter,” which has left them unable to continue offering their bitcoin trading services.
 
The Challenges Faced by Localbitcoins and its Ultimate Demise in the Crypto Market
 
The first peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin exchange, Localbitcoins, is ending operations after over ten years in the business. The exchange announced the news on its website, stating that new sign-ups will be suspended as of Feb. 9, 2023, and trading will be suspended seven days later, on Feb. 16. Following the suspension of trading, Localbitcoins users will only be able to withdraw their bitcoins and have 12 months to do so.…</span>

CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Network Activity Index Has Shot Up Recently
 
As per data from the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, the BTC network has seen a significant uptick in activity. The relevant indicator here is CryptoQuant’s “network activity index,” which evaluates the activity of the Bitcoin network using four metrics.
 
The four indicators it uses are the total number of active addresses on the network (that is, the addresses being involved in at least 1 send/receive transaction), the number of transactions, the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) count (UTXOs are basically the amount left over in wallets after a transaction takes place…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin dropped to a two-week low on Feb. 9, with prices falling below the $23,000 mark after a brief rally on Wednesday. Cryptocurrencies moved lower across the board, as uncertainty surrounding the state of the global economy impacted investor confidence. Ethereum also slipped, following a move towards $1,700 during yesterday’s session.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) slipped to a two-week low on Thursday, with prices falling below $23,000 in the process.
 
Following a high of $23,191.32 on hump-day, BTC/USD plunged to an intraday low of $22,458.26 in today’s session.
 
The decline sent bitcoin to its lowest level since January 26, and came as prices broke out of a key support point at $22,500.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the sell-off came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell to a one-month low, after moving below a floor of its own.
 
The index is currently tracking at 56.50, which is marginally under its recent support level at the 58.00 mark.
 
Since this bottom, bulls have moved to buy the dip, with BTC now trading at $22,701.04, as of writing.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also saw a slight resurgence snapped, with market sentiment shifting in a bearish direction.
 
ETH/USD has bottomed at $1,615.06 so far on Thursday, which comes less than 24 hours after reaching a high of $1,678.09.
 
Yesterday’s move saw the world’s second largest cryptocurrency break out of a ceiling at $1,675, however it was unable to sustain this momentum.
 
 
Looking at the chart, bears seem to be targeting a floor at $1,600 for ETH, however all advances to this point have so far been rejected.
 
This comes as the RSI appears to have found a relatively stable floor at the 57.00 mark, which has given confidence to nervous bulls.
 
At the time of writing, ethereum has rebounded from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $1,632.90.
