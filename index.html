                              <span>The legal tussle surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former CEO of FTX, intensifies as a federal judge denies his defense team&#x27;s  
plea for an extended sentencing process. This decision occurs amid the prospect  
of a looming second trial following SBF&#x27;s recent conviction on seven  
charges of fraud and conspiracy.
As initially reported by Coindesk, SBF&#x27;s  
defense team has sought an extension of four to six weeks for his sentencing  
process, Coindesk first reported. The team emphasized a potential second trial  
slated for March 11, which could impact the pending sentencing scheduled for  
March 28.

Cardano Founder Celebrates Full Blocks
 
For the longest time, the Cardano network has been referred to as a zombie chain due to it not seeing as many transactions as other networks in the same category. However, as the price of its native token, ADA, has been on the rise, so has the network usage.
 
 
Recently, the community has gone from being worried about not enough activity to the blocks being produced on the blockchain being too full. This has been a welcome development for Hoskinson who took to X …</span>

&quot;What luck for rulers that men do not think.” 
– Adolf Hitler
Bitcoin will not kill the U.S. dollar. It will become the U.S. dollar, with all controls and restrictions that any CBDC issuer could dream of. “Impossible!” I hear you crying out, giggling to myself in the face of the utmost ignorance that seems to have accumulated quadratically with bitcoin’s price increase. “Bitcoin is freedom money!”
