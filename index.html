                              <span>Bitcoin traded around the $30,000 region to start the weekend, as markets remained optimistic that an ETF approval could be looming. This has been the topic of the week, with many speculating how high crypto markets could surge on such potential news. Ethereum slipped from Fridayâs peak.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was hovering marginally below the $30,000 level on Saturday as a section of bulls looked to seize this weekâs profits.
 
Following a peak at $30,104.09 on Friday, BTC/USD has fallen to a current low of $29,816.64 during todayâs session.
 
Despite the decline, the worldâs largest cryptocurrency remains higher than yesterdayâs low at the $29,376.12 mark.
 
 
The easing of momentum comes as the relative strength index (RSI) continued its stay in overbought territory, with a present reading of 73.17.
 
This is the highest point the index has tracked at since February, giving some traders concerns of a potential pullback.
 
Should this occur in the coming days, bears will likely look to push bitcoin to the $29,000 level, which seems to be the next visible floor.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also edged lower to start the weekend, however remains above the $1,600 level.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,593.45 earlier in the day, however bulls then pushed price to a high of $1,610.11.
 
Overall, ethereum traders appear to still be targeting its long-term floor of $1,650, with todayâs decline a possible pitstop towards this point.
 
 
Unlike bitcoin above, ETHâs price strength has yet to climb into the overbought mark, and is currently tracking at 51.76.
 
This is slightly above a ceiling at 50.00, with the next firm resistance point around the 60.00 region.
 
In the event bulls push for this point, ethereum will almost certainly be trading above $1,650.

According to court documents, Thor Technologies and Chin were found guilty of conducting an unregistered offering of crypto asset securities amounting to $2.6 million.Â 
 
SEC Prevails In Unregistered Crypto Offering Lawsuit
 
The judgment was issued by a San Francisco district court, which permanently restrains and enjoins the defendants from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.Â 
 
These sections pertain to the sale and offering of what the SEC denominates as âcrypto securitiesâ without proper registration or exemption.

                              <span>Several reports have revealed that Binance, which is recognized as the leading crypto exchange by trading volume, intends to discontinue its Visa crypto card on December 20, 2023. The enterprise emphasized that only a âsmall number of Binance usersâ would be affected by this development.
 
Binance to Discontinue Visa Offering by Yearâs End
 
In 2023, crypto debit cards have been falling out of favor rapidly, triggered in part by a series of bankruptcies that ignited a crypto bear market. Back in March, Bitpay in the U.S. phased out its prepaid Mastercard program, although it assured users of a renewed card service on the horizon. However, this week, holders of the Binance Visa card were informed via email that the card would cease to be functional by the close of the year.
 
The email communicated that the Binance Visa card would become non-operational post-December 20, 2023. The Binance Visa, which was available to users in Europe, was utilized by individuals across various countries including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, the Czech Republic, and Finland, among others. Binance has suggested that cardholders can switch to Binance Pay for their shopping needs, provided the service is accessible in their region.
 
The email also clarified that, despite the changes, Binance accounts would remain unaffected and continue to operate as usual. A lively discussion about the Binance Visa card issue has taken place on social media. âBinance shutting down their Visa card,â one person said. âThe [Gnosis Pay] card cannot come soon enough! wen shipping?â Another user expressed indifference towards the shutdown, expressing a preference for the Crypto.com Visa card instead.

ConsenSys, recently appraised at roughly $7 billion, is at the center of these allegations. The company, which has been instrumental in numerous blockchain innovations, is now caught in a maelstrom of accusations, primarily revolving around equity commitments and asset transfers.
 
 
Accusations And Alleged Equity Violations
 
A group of over twenty former employees has lodged a lawsuit against Lubin, suggesting that the Ethereum co-founder orchestrated a complex asset transfer within the holding structure of ConsenSys.

They want all regulated entities â VASPs, banks, financial institutions or entities like casinos, etc. â to by default submit reports of any transactions interacting with mixing within 30 days of noticing the relevant transaction and its association to mixing activity.
