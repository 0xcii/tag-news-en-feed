                              <span>Bitcoin has once again flashed another particularly deadly formation that often sends its price into a downward spiral. This time around, a death cross that has not been seen in the digital asset for more than one year has appeared again. This report takes a look at what happened the last time that this particular death cross was flagged.
 
Bitcoin Flashes Rare Death Cross
 
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), pseudonymous crypto analyst Game of Trades has alerted the Bitcoin community to an interesting formation on the BTC chart. The infamous death cross appeared just as the digital asset started marking its support above $25,800, sparking interest.
 
 
According to the analyst, this death cross is formed when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, which took p…</span>

Only A Calculator To Work With
 
In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Karpelès stated that he had only a “simple calculator” to work with when he was arrested back in 2015. This was the “most computing power” he got when he had to review “20000 pages of evidence including over 5000 pages of accounting.”

                              <span>The Singapore-based investment management and software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, SMI Vantage, plans to launch a bitcoin mining facility in the state of Sarawak in Borneo, Malaysia. The company has signed a rental agreement and anticipates operations to begin by the end of the third quarter.
 
SMI Vantage Charts New Territory With Sarawak Bitcoin Mining Venture
 
According to a report from The Edge Singapore, SMI Vantage, an investment and SaaS firm, has disclosed its intention to commence bitcoin mining operations in Sarawak. The firm is in the process of setting up two containers equipped with application-specific integrated circuit mining machines. Operations are projected to start by October 1, 2023, or the conclusion of the third quarter.
 
SMI’s recent agreement was advised by Sovereign Systemtechnik, a Singapore-based engineering and technology firm. The deal was inked in September 2022 and marks SMI’s third bitcoin mining venture. While SMI already has operations in Melaka, Malaysia, it also boasts a bitcoin mining facility in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei’s capital. Beyond SaaS and cryptocurrency mining, SMI has a keen interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics solutions.
 
While bitcoin mining is legal in Malaysia, using stolen electricity for crypto mining is highly discouraged. Reports indicate that from 2018, illegal crypto mining activities resulted in a loss of RM2.3 billion ($491,610) for Malaysia, with over 7,200 cases documented. SMI states that in Melaka, the company pays $0.07 to $0.08 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and $0.05 to $0.06 per kWh in Bandar Seri Begawan.

                              <span>On Wednesday, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman provided a brief analysis of the current economic landscape in the United States. Krugman asserted that the nation has experienced “remarkable disinflation.” According to him, the available data paints a compelling picture, suggesting that the “war on inflation has been pretty much won — without a recession.” Krugman emphasized that inflation turned out “to be transitory,” contrary to initial apprehensions.

At a recent conference in Singapore, Garlinghouse highlighted the importance of crafting appropriate regulatory frameworks for the crypto industry.
 
The Necessity Of Proper Regulation
 
While appearing at Token 2049 in Singapore, Garlinghouse emphasized the inevitability of governmental involvement in crypto. Garlinghouse highlighted a prevailing sentiment among certain factions of the crypto community that vehemently opposes any form of regulation.
 
 
According to the Ripple CEO, this is a stance that, if perpetuated, may hinder the industry’s long-term growth. Garlinghouse stated:
