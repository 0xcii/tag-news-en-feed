The ideals of freedom and open markets are at risk of being undermined by influential political forces seeking to impose oppressive order and control in the name of security. This article delves into the pressing need to fix our manipulated markets, protect Bitcoin and its inherent anti-totalitarian qualities, and inform US policymakers that democratic values are what’s at stake.

A God Candle In The Making
 
On Tuesday, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto came forward with their most recent analysis of the XRP price. Egrag’s conclusion on this analysis came with the expectation of what is usually referred to as a ‘God candle’. This simply means a continuously increasing price trend that leaves a straight green line in its wake.

FTX Creditors Sift Through Offers for Exchange’s Possible Reawakening
 
Throughout the year, whispers of FTX’s potential revival have surfaced approximately four times. During his first interview post-FTX collapse in January 2023, FTX’s restructuring head, CEO John J. Ray III, hinted at a resurgence. In a subsequent April hearing, the topic resurfaced. By mid-June, murmurs of “FTX 2.0” were in the air, and with each whisper, the value of FTX’s native crypto asset FTT spikes.

                              <span>Bitcoin has risen over 110% in 2023 at the time of writing, where the price of the asset started the year off at $16,677 on January 1, has now pumped to above $35,000 only 10 months later. With more room to run this year as hype builds in the market around the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC and the upcoming halving event, many are now questioning if this is the end of this cycle&#x27;s eventful bear market.
Since the few disastrous incidents that happened in the bear market causing the price drop, things are now looking more optimistic. As some of the worlds largest asset managers, including Fidelity, VanEck and WisdomTree, have filed in hopes to be the first in the United States to get approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. One name in particular though is making more headlines than the rest, and that is the worlds largest asset manger BlackRock, who manages about $10 trillion.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently made an appearance on Fox Business stating that their clients around the world are interested in getting exposure to Bitcoin, saying the recent price rally has been a &quot;flight to quality.&quot; Earlier this month, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their approval odds for a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC to 90% by January 10, 2024.



The next Bitcoin having is expected to take place in roughly 180 days in late April, 2024. The event will see the Bitcoin block reward drop from 6.25 BTC per block to only 3.125 BTC. This will be the fourth halving in Bitcoin&#x27;s history, with the first happening in November 2012, the second happened in July 2016, and the third happened in May 2020. Historically, a year leading up to and after the halving, the price of BTC goes up substantially.</span>

Bitcoin Social Volume Suggests Rise Of Bullish Bias Among Investors
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, BTC traders have turned optimistic on social media after the latest price surge. The relevant indicator here is the “social volume,” which tells us about the amount of discussion that social media users are taking part in related to a given topic.
 
The metric calculates this in terms of the unique number of posts/threads/messages that are making mentions of the term in question. By “unique,” what’s meant here is that every post is counted only once, regardless of how many mentions it contains of the topic (as long as…</span>

                              <span>Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the indicted founder of the  
cryptocurrency exchange FTX, will testify in his defense. This move,  
announced by his attorney during a recent conference call, paves the way for a  
potentially intense cross-examination by federal prosecutors who aim to  
scrutinize his role in the collapse of the crypto exchange.
According to a report by CNBC, SBF&#x27;s decision to  
take the stand followed a resolution  
of a dispute regarding his access to attention-deficit/hyperactivity  
disorder (ADHD) medication. This issue had previously  
raised concern about his ability to actively participate in the ongoing trial.
A Risky Legal Strategy?
SBF’s decision to testify became possible only after  
his legal team, in collaboration with the prosecution, ensured that he had an

                              <span>One of the fundamental limitations of the Lightning protocol is how payment routing is handled and accomplished. It is entirely source routed, meaning that the sender of a payment is the one who constructs the entire route from themselves to the receiver in order to facilitate the payment. This presents an issue when it comes to the changing balances of channels over time as they are routing payments between numerous different users across the network, once a sender &quot;locks in&quot; and decides on a specific route, that route cannot be changed until a failure message makes it way back to the sender, allowing them to construct an entirely new route going around the point where the initial attempt failed.

The ideals of freedom and open markets are at risk of being undermined by influential political forces seeking to impose oppressive order and control in the name of security. This article delves into the pressing need to fix our manipulated markets, protect Bitcoin and its inherent anti-totalitarian qualities, and inform US policymakers that democratic values are what’s at stake.

Shiba Inu Has Seen A TD Sequential Buy Signal Recently
 
As explained by analyst Ali in a new post on X, the SHIB weekly chart has observed a buy signal recently. The “TD (Tom Demark) Sequential” is a tool in technical analysis that’s used to time reversals in the price of an asset.
 
There are two phases of the indicator: a 9 candle setup phase and a 13 candle countdown phase. The former of these starts when the price observes a flip and continues until the ninth candle is hit. At that point, the price hits a bottom or a top (depending on the surrounding price trend).
 
 
Following the setup phase, the countdown phase begins. Once this TD Sequential phase hits th…</span>
