Robinhood Lists Shiba Inu
 
Robinhood made this known in an X (formerly Twitter) post by informing New York State residents that Shiba Inu was now available for them. The trading platform also revealed that it had listed Avalanche (AVAX) and Compound (COMP), which these users could also trade now alongside Shiba Inu. 
 
 
Before now, Robinhood already made Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Chainlink (LINK), and Aave (AAVE) available to its New York customers. Last year, the…</span>

Bitcoin &amp; Dogecoin Are Among Coins With Highest Investor Profitability Ratio
 
In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock talked about how holder profitability compares between some of the top layer-1 networks in the sector.
 
Here, holder profitability refers to the total percentage of investors or addresses on a given cryptocurrency network that are currently carrying some net unrealized gains.
 
 
This metric works by going through the transaction history of each address on the blockchain to find the average price at which it acquired its coins. If this average cost basis for any holder is less than the current spot pri…</span>

JUST IN: 🇺🇸 FBI warns Americans against using non-KYC #Bitcoin and crypto money transmitting services. pic.twitter.com/BkSuG6MiCE
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 25, 2024
  
  
  
This announcement, identified as Alert Number I-042524-PSA, urged Americans to only engage with registered Money Services Businesses (MSBs) that comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.
According to United States federal law, cryptocurrency money transmitting services must be registered as MSBs and adhere to AML requirements (31 U.S.C. § 5330; 31 CFR §§ 1010; 1022). The FBI says failure to comply may result in financial disruptions during law enforcement actions, particularly if funds are mixed with illegally obtained money.
The warning clarified that services that knowingly facilitate illegal transactions or violate federal laws are subject to investigation by law enforcement agencies, and that individuals using such services may lose access to their funds during enforcement operations.
Just yesterday, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) arrested the founders and CEO of popular privacy focused Bitcoin wallet and mixer, Samourai Wallet, and charged them with laundering “more than $100 million in criminal proceeds.” The DOJ then worked with law enforcement in Portugal and Iceland to arrest one of the founders, and seized Samourai&#x27;s web servers and domain, in addition to serving a seizure warrant on the Google Play Store for its mobile app.</span>
