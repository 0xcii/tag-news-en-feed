Crypto analyst BitLuxe revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin was trading near crucial support between $0.146 and $0.151. He then suggested that it may be time to go long on the foremost meme coin, although with a tight stop loss, possibly due to the uncertainty that is still in the market.

                              <span>Ripple developers Aanchal Malhotra and Vito Tumas have introduced a ground-breaking proposal for a native lending protocol on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). If passed, this proposal is expected to expand the network’s decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities and increase XRP’s utility.
 
What The Lending Protocol On XRP Ledger Is About
 
Ripple’s development arm, RippleX, elaborated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the lending protocol will allow users to borrow and lend digital assets peer-to-peer (p2p) without the need for “unnecessary intermediaries.” The protocol will utilize a modular design that focuses on “flexibility and reusability.”
 
 
Furthermore, the modular design will introduce three specifications. The first is the XLS-64d, which will allow a single pseudo-account to be associ…</span>

In the cartoon, interspersed amongst the absurd childish narratives, were a few valuable technical insights regarding different scaling proposals in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Of course, in true cartoon fashion, buried between wild exaggeration and embellishment. 
The end goal of the cartoon was to propose a new mechanism for moving in and out of scaling layers built on top of Bitcoin. To disentangle that actual proposal from the cartoon, we’ll have to break down the two pieces involved.

                              <span>The Bitcoin halving event, a pivotal occurrence, is scheduled for April, 19 2024. This quadrennial event will reduce the block subsidy for Bitcoin miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, thereby halving the reward that miners receive for their efforts. Such events have historically led to profound shifts in the mining landscape, potentially influencing various economic and operational facets of Bitcoin mining.
Economic Outlook and Market Predictions
After the halving, the immediate impact is a considerable decrease in miner revenue due to the reduced block subsidy. This could lead to a decline in the hashrate as less efficient miners may turn unprofitable and exit the network.

                              <span>Despite Bitcoin&#x27;s decline, several alternative cryptocurrencies remain robust. Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness a $94 million outflow, although outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may decelerate. Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase&#x27;s premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin&#x27;s all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance. Solana&#x27;s (SOL) decentralized exchange (DEX) achieves a monthly volume of $50 billion, with revenue soaring 30-fold. OKX announces support for a new Solana token standard. Despite expectations, Layer 2 activity remains sluggish post-Dencun, according to Vitalik Buterin.</span>
