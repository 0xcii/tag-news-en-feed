                              <span>With recent estimates showing a startling $528 million in withdrawals from digital asset investment products, crypto markets are under great flux. Rising US economic worries combined with geopolitical concerns and significant market liquidations help to explain this fall. The outflows capture a general sense of concern among investors as they consider how possible economic downturns would affect the crypto scene.
 
 
Data from CoinShares shows that institutional crypto investment products had their first outflow in four weeks last week—$528 million overall. Along with geopolitical issues and more general market liquidations across many asset classes, this fall is ascribed to worries of a recession in the United States.

                              <span>Metaplanet, a publicly listed Japanese company, has announced plans to raise up to ¥10.08 billion ($70 million) through a gratis allotment of stock acquisition rights to existing shareholders. The majority of funds raised will be used to purchase additional Bitcoin.

JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Metaplanet announces to raise ¥10.08 billion to buy more #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/HXBf7RNeMx
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 6, 2024
  
  
  
The company will issue one stock acquisition right per common share to shareholders of record on September 5. These rights will allow shareholders to acquire Metaplanet common stock at an exercise price of 555 yen (~$4) during the exercise period from September 6 to October 15.
Metaplanet currently holds around 246 bitcoins worth ~$13.4 million. By raising $70 million, the company aims to significantly expand its Bitcoin treasury as part of its long-term growth strategy.
This move mirrors the approach pioneered by MicroStrategy, the Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has raised debt and sold shares to accumulate over 220,000 Bitcoin, now worth billions. 
By positioning itself as Japan&#x27;s leading publicly traded bitcoin holding company, Metaplanet hopes to follow MicroStrategy&#x27;s playbook and create similar shareholder value. It aims to pioneer Japanese listed firms in adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset.
Bitcoin offers twin benefits as an asset with long-term appreciation potential that also hedges against fiat currency depreciation. Building a Bitcoin treasury strengthens the company&#x27;s balance sheet and supports future growth initiatives.
