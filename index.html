Bitcoin Hashrate Rise May Suggest Miners Are Gearing Up For Next Bull Run
 
The “mining hashrate” is a metric that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that’s connected to the Bitcoin blockchain right now. The metric is measured in terms of “hashes per second” (H/s), where a “hash” is basically a function the BTC miners have to perform on the network.
 
As the cryptocurrency’s hashrate has grown quite large by now, much larger units like terahashes per second (TH/s) or exahashes per second (EH/s) are used instead these days.
 
 
The hashrate can provide as a look into the interest that the miners have in the cryptocurrency right now. When the ind…</span>

As a university engineering educator and a bitcoiner, I am acutely aware that education about Bitcoin is crucial to the full realization of its potential. The intrinsic properties of Bitcoin make it a sound foundation for a new monetary system. However, it will have to grow significantly in the emergent property of wide acceptance before it can challenge the status quo. Acceptance will only grow with education.

                              <span>On Tuesday, the BRC20 token, dubbed ordinals (ORDI), soared over 40% against the U.S. dollar, fueled by news from Binance about its impending inclusion on the exchange’s roster of traded currencies. ORDI rocketed from an early 24-hour low of $7 to a peak of $11.53, settling at $10.48 per token at the time of this report.
 
Binance Listing Catapults ORDI Token
 
The announcement from Binance, the leading global crypto exchange, to usher ORDI onto its platform gave the token a significant boost. ORDI isn’t new to the spotlight, having been previously embraced by other major exchanges like Okx. Yet, it was the nod from Binance that sent ORDI soaring past the $11 mark in the morning’s Eastern Time trading flurry.

Coinbase’s website for alleged violations of the country’s laws on digital  
assets. The officials from Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Culture and Information confirmed  
the restriction today (Tuesday), according to the local media outlet, Kursiv. 
This decision followed the government&#x27;s enforcement  
of the Law on Digital Assets, which became effective in February 2023. The  
regulation aims to restrict the issuance and trading of digital currencies and  
crypto exchange activities without a national license. 
The move is part of Kazakhstan&#x27;s broader strategy to  
establish more stringent regulations in the cryptocurrency sector, impacting  
not only Coinbase but other major international crypto exchanges as well.

                              <span>XRP is leading the charge in a weekend rally. XRP has not only maintained its upward trajectory but also claimed the fourth position in terms of market capitalization, displacing Binance Coin (BNB). 
 
For the first time since late July, XRP reached a three-month high of $0.73, as reported by CoinGecko. Currently, XRP’s value stands at approximately $0.692314, marking a 2.8% increase over the past 24 hours, while its seven-day rally has accumulated gains of 20.9%.
 
Data analysis suggests that XRP’s recent gains were primarily driven by spot trading activity.

                              <span>It appears X, Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and xAI won&#x27;t be issuing their own cryptocurrency anytime soon.
Announced on X late last week, Elon Musk has declared that none of his companies will be launching a cryptocurrency token, in a move that underscores a shift in the tech industry&#x27;s attitude toward competing with Bitcoin as a digital currency. 
This announcement is particularly noteworthy in light of X (formerly Twitter), which recently announced its intention to transform into a platform for financial services. Previously, there had been speculation that Musk might integrate Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency he has vocally supported in the past, into his companies&#x27; operations.
Under the leadership of Jack Dorsey, Twitter was known for its pro-Bitcoin stance, actively incorporating new features like Bitcoin tipping, a feature that has attracted him to the upstart social network, Nostr. However, Elon Musk has seemed to walk back that support, creating questions about his intentions.
Musk&#x27;s decision not to launch a crypto token carries significance, as it suggests that the concept of issuing worthless cryptocurrencies is losing favor among prominent Silicon Valley tech leaders. 
This shift in sentiment could be attributed to the increasing regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency industry, or simply the failures over the last decade for any crypto token to differentiate from Bitcoin. 
With Musk&#x27;s reputation as a tech visionary and influencer, his statement may influence other tech leaders and entrepreneurs, to put the idea to rest as well.</span>
