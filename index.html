                              <span>Data from CoinGeko shows that Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Jupiter recently surpassed Ethereum’s foremost DEX Uniswap in an important metric. This has created a narrative that the SOL network might indeed be ready to take over Ethereum’s position as the King of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). 
 
Jupiter Surpasses Uniswap In Trading Volume 
 
According to CoinGeko, Jupiter has recorded over $510 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours, surpassing Ethereum’s Uniswap V3 and V2, which recorded $455 and $76 million respectively. Jupiter’s recent dominance is believed to be partly due to the recent WEN airdrop that occurred on its launchpad.

The cash holding almost doubled from $2.3 billion at the end of October, according to Chapter 11 monthly operating reports.
Selling Crypto for Cash
First reported by Bloomberg, the bankruptcy administrators of the crypto exchange sold its crypto assets to raise $1.8 billion last month. The figure only considers the four largest affiliates, including FTX Trading Ltd and Alameda Research LLC, meaning it could go higher if all the affiliates are considered.
The exchange further confirmed trading derivatives to hedge exposure on its digital asset holdings and earned extra yield.

ESMA Seeks Input on Regulations

The first  
consultation paper covers proposed guidance on the conditions and supervision

to situations where a client independently seeks out and initiates services

MiCA.

                              <span>Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, has made bullish predictions about Bitcoin’s potential trajectory, suggesting a “conservative” increase of more than 300% in the coming months, with a possible peak of $170,000 after the halving in April, based on historical data. Scaramucci also foresees a long-term scenario where BTC could reach $400,000 and potentially near half of gold’s market capitalization, which would represent a 10x increase.
 
 
Despite the recent fluctuations, the top crypto’s resilience and long-term potential continue to attract investors and enthusiasts. Other experts, such as ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, have also made bullish predictions, with some foreseeing its price reaching $1.5 million by 2030 in a bullish scenario.

Interpol Examines Law Enforcement in the Metaverse
Interpol, the international police organization, is beginning to consider the possibilities of crimes in the metaverse and how to fight them. Last week, the police institution issued a report called “Metaverse: A Law Enforcement Perspective,” which specifies the different crimes that can be committed in the metaverse and the opportunities it presents for improving the response of law enforcement agencies.
