                              <span>Ripple’s president has shared her crypto predictions, stating that 2024 could mark “the breakout moment where institutional adoption for real-world utility takes off.” She emphasized: “The industry needs to build compliance tooling in a decentralized environment. It’s the next frontier of innovation in blockchain.”
 
‘We Reached the Tipping Point for Crypto to Be Recognized as Mainstream’
 
Ripple’s president, Monica Long, shared several predictions regarding the future of crypto and blockchain over the next 12 months on social media platform X Tuesday.
 
“Within the past couple of years, we’ve seen many more traditional financial players such as Fidelity, Blackrock, Paypal, and Visa integrating or partnering with crypto-native companies to offer crypto and blockchain services and products…</span>

                              <span>Bartek Kiepuszewski, the co-founder of L2Beat, a portal for tracking Ethereum layer-2 activities, is concerned about the security and consistency of existing off-chain scaling solutions, suggesting that without fraud-proofs, there is room for fraud and irregularities.
 
Focus On Optimism And Manta: What’s Going On?
 
Taking to X on December 20, Kiepuszewski observed that some layer-2 solutions, such as Manta and Optimism, rely on sequencers to post data to Ethereum. However, without fraud-proofs, there is no way to verify that the data published by the Sequencer on the Ethereum mainnet is accurate or complete. 
 
In the co-founder’s view, whenever a sequencer posts the batch of transactions on the main net, there is no layer-1 state or event change. Per Kiepuszewski ‘s assessment, this is …</span>

This pro-XRP legal expert, however, thinks otherwise as he provides a different perspective on XRP’s relatively tepid movement. 
 
XRP Holders Need Deeper Conviction
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bill Morgan said that convictions (likely in reference to XRP holders) need to be “deeper than a day, week, or month of price action.” He mentioned how he doesn’t read much into a month’s price action in the crypto market. 
 
 
Before then, the legal expert had highlighted how XRP’s price action hasn’t been great, as it is down over 2% over the last month. Although the 2% drop seems to be significant to Morgan, he was choosi…</span>

However, the court’s refusal to grant this extension marks a significant moment in this ongoing legal saga.
