The crypto tracking and compliance platform MistTrack detailed this action, which targeted 12 Ethereum addresses identified as part of phishing operations.
 
 
Details Of The Freeze
 
The affected addresses used in the phishing were notably tagged as “USDT Banned Address,” indicating their involvement in potential money laundering activities commonly associated with phishing groups.
 
Phishing groups often transfer their ill-gotten gains to secondary platforms and utilize cryptocurrency mixers to obscure the origins of their funds.

LOVE HAS BEEN debased.
In the past, love referred to the virtues present in enduring, intimate relationships. It demanded sacrifice, discipline, and patience. Classical writers saw love as a virtue because of its inherent difficulty. To paraphrase Apostle Paul, love is patient, kind, unenvious, and humble.59 Cultivating these qualities requires tremendous internal work and self-improvement.

Bitcoin Miners Haven’t Been Under This Much Stress In 3 Years
 
As pointed out by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a post on X, Bitcoin miners are being significantly underpaid right now. The indicator of relevance here is the “miner profit/loss sustainability,” which basically tells us whether the miner revenues are fair or not currently.
 
 
Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in this BTC metric over the last few years:
 

 
 
From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin miner profit/loss sustainability had been at positive levels earlier when the rally towards the new all-time high had occurred.

Alexey Pertsev, a 31-year old Russian national living in the Netherlands and one of the developers of the Ethereum-based privacy tool Tornado Cash, was today found guilty of money laundering by the Dutch court: he’s been sentenced to 64 months in prison. The fact that Pertsev never held custody of any cryptocurrency flowing through Tornado Cash — or could even control how the smart contract operated — was deemed irrelevant by the panel of judges, as he did contribute to the development of the software.
In line with Dutch public prosecutor Martine Boerlage, the court ruled that Tornado Cash was essentially ran like a business, operated by PepperSec, the company founded and operated by Pertsev and his t…</span>

Bitcoin Is Out Of The “Danger Zone”
 
Rekt Capital mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Bitcoin Post-Halving “Danger Zone” is officially over. He added that Bitcoin is “celebrating with a good bounce from the Re-Accumulation Range Low support.” The crypto analyst had previously explained that the danger zone was the downside wick that Bitcoin experienced 21 days after the halving in 2016.
