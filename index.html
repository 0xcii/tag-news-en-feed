                              <span>Bitcoin (BTC) mining has faced increasing scrutiny from the US government and environmental critics in recent years. Certain groups raised concerns that the energy consumption required for validating transactions on the network contributes to global carbon emissions.
 
 A recent article by The New York Times (NYT) reignited this debate, alleging “that Bitcoin mining is a major contributor to environmental damage,” as reported by Bitcoinist. 
 
However, Riot Platforms, a leading Bitcoin mining company, claims the New York Times article was full of “distortions” and “falsehoods” designed to push a political agenda. In response to the New York Times allegations, Riot defended the industry and emphasized its commitment to sustainable Bitcoin mining practices.

                              <span>Move over, DeFi—ReFi is coming? Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki has stepped away from DeFi grant-giving machine Gitcoin as it fully decentralizes and is now focused on regenerative finance (huh?) and ReFi incubator Supermodular. He aims to &quot;regenerate the regenerators.&quot; He explained it all to Dan Roberts and Liam Kelly, and also talks DAO structure, crypto factions, NFT use cases, his book &quot;Greenpilled,&quot; and much more.
