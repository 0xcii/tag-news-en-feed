Multichain Protocol Struggles as CEO Disappears
 
This week, the cryptocurrency community has been discussing the Multichain Cross-Chain Router Protocol after the team revealed its founder has gone missing.

I recently watched with bemused indifference CNN’s Donald Trump town hall charade, yet another in an endless list of macabre political and social zombie dances.
The truth is, I don’t care all that much anymore about party politics, about the upcoming presidential election cycle, about supposedly heartfelt and earnest liberal and conservative political expressions within the American polity, about the hand-wringing surrounding the tenuous future of American Democracy, etc. What I do care about, however, is how easy it is for human beings to be manipulated, to believe the lies.

                              <span>Tron rose to a one-year high to start the weekend, as founder Justin Sun confirmed an integration to the ethereum blockchain network. In a tweet, Sun said, “TRON has now expanded its reach by going live on the Ethereum blockchain by leveraging the BitTorrent bridge.” 
 
Tron (TRX)
 
Tron (TRX) was one the biggest movers on Saturday, with prices rising by as much as 11% in today’s session.
 
Following a low of $0.0762 on Friday, TRX/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.08545 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the surge, the token, which recently registered a record number of daily transactions, hit its highest point since June 2 last year.
 
 
Overall, tron is up 12.16% in the last seven days, with the latest rally leading to a breakout of a ceiling at $0.0796
 
The relative strength index (RSI) also moved above a resistance level of its own at 70.00, and is now tracking at 75.77.
 
Should this uptrend continue, there is a good chance that bulls will attempt to take the index to a higher ceiling at 79.00.
 
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, hit a multi-week high to start the weekend, colliding with a key price ceiling in the process.
 
XRP/USD surged to a high of $0.5299 earlier on Saturday, which comes following yesterday’s low of $0.5137.
 
This move led to the token nearing a collision with a resistance level at $0.5300, securing its highest point since April 19 in the process.
 
 
Following this, prices have since slipped, with earlier bulls seemingly opting to secure gains.
 
At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5234, and this comes as the RSI falls below its own ceiling at 69.00.
 
Price strength is now at 67.71, with the next visible floor at the 64.00 mark.
