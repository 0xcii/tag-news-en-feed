This information was brought to light by the crypto intelligence firm Arkham Intel.
 
Arkham took to X (formerly Twitter) today to disclose that Trump’s initial receipt of $7,100 of TRUMP, transferred between August and October 2023 by the coin’s team, had ballooned to a worth of over $1.07 million. The firm remarked:
 

Donald Trump makes $1M on TRUMP Memecoin. Donald Trump’s holdings of TRUMP have just passed $1M. He originally received $7,1K of TRUMP […] That’s 150x. […] Now that TRUMP is $1.90, his holdings have increased by 15,000%. Is he outperforming most of CT?

SEC Says It’s a Victim of a SIM Swap Attack
 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provided an update on Monday regarding the unauthorized access of its @SECGov account on social media platform X. The attack occurred on Jan. 9 and the SEC’s X account was used to post an unauthorized message claiming the agency had approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Lack Of A “Minimum Threshold” In the New Rules
 
On Monday Night, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Paul Grewal, took to the X social media platform (formerly known as Twitter) to present Coinbase’s thoughts on the US Treasury’s proposed rule on crypto mixing.

Bitcoin Supply In Loss Is Nearing In On Historical Rebound Level
 
As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained, the BTC price and Supply in Loss have followed a certain pattern a few times. The “Supply in Loss” here is an indicator measuring the percentage of the Bitcoin supply currently being held at some loss.
 
 
This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. If this last transfer price for any coin was less than the current spot price of the asset, then that particular coin is sitting on some unrealized loss right now.

This perspective is based on analyzing critical price levels that could support BTC’s falling value.
 
 
Further Plunge Ahead?
 
The ongoing decline in Bitcoin’s value, as highlighted by Bitfinex, has caused a significant reduction in short-term holder profits and raised concerns about increased selling pressure from this group of investors.
 
 
Analysts from Bitfinex emphasize that this trend could potentially lead to “further substantial price correction,” in the Bitcoin market. Short-term holders, known for their sensitivity to marke…</span>

China’s Play Could Benefit Bitcoin And Crypto Prices
 
According to a report from Bloomberg, Chinese authorities are exploring injecting capital into their stock market. Chinese equities have been on a downtrend for several weeks. The bearish momentum has pushed authorities in the country to take “forceful” steps, per a high-ranking government official.

revealed that the unauthorized post about approving spot  
Bitcoin ETFs on January 9 was related to a &quot;SIM swap&quot; attack. 
This tactic involves transferring a mobile phone  
number to a different device without the owner&#x27;s consent. The US securities  
watchdog clarified that the attack occurred via a telecommunication network  
rather than through its internal systems. It emphasized that its core systems  
were never compromised.
The misleading post, which declared the green light  
for the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, caused a frenzy in the  
cryptocurrency sector. However, the SEC was quick to dismiss the post,  
attributing it to a hacker who had gained control of the mobile phone number  
linked to the account.

                              <span>According to an announcement from the publicly-listed bitcoin miner Iris Energy, the mining operation has increased its operating capacity to 6 exahash per second (EH/s) and expects an additional 4 EH/s to be online by the first half of 2024.
 
Iris Boosts Mining Capacity to 6 EH/s Amidst IREN Share Dip
 
​​The announcement on Tuesday from Iris Energy (Nasdaq: IREN) highlighted the growth of its mining operations to 6 EH/s, following the deployment of new mining hardware. Over the last six months, Iris has reported several purchases of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining rigs.
 
Notably, in October 2023, the company disclosed the acquisition of Bitmain S21 Antminers worth $19.6 million. This was followed in November by the purchase of 7,000 T21 Antminers from the ASIC manufacturer.
 
Additionally, in December, Iris announced the acquisition of another 8,380 T21 Antminers from Bitmain. Iris Energy is projecting an increase in its mining operations, expecting an additional 4 exahash per second (EH/s) to become operational by the end of the first half of 2024.
 
 
The company also emphasized its trajectory towards achieving a 20 EH/s target by the latter half of 2024. This ambitious goal comes on the heels of a significant acquisition – a purchase and fixed price option agreement for an extra 10 EH/s of Bitmain T21 miners.
 
 
Shares of IREN have not performed as strongly as they did in 2023, experiencing a notable decline of 47.2% against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year. A recent analysis by theminermag.com reveals that publicly-listed mining companies have seen a reduction in value, amounting to $6 billion, since the year’s commencement.
