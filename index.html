TAIPEI, December 25th 2023 – Dyson Finance, the game-changer in Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), has made waves in the past quarter on Polygon zkEVM and Linea, challenging the norm of DEXs grappling with Liquidity Provider (LP) profitability. In an impressive feat, Dyson Finance has become the fastest-growing platform on both Layer2 chains within just 30 days, heralding a new era in DeFi’s Liquidity Provision landscape.
 
The protocol addresses a crucial hurdle hindering DeFi growth by simplifying the LP experience, setting it apart from conventional DEXs. Dyson Finance introduces a novel approach – the concept of Dual Investment, inspired by the dynamic world of Forex trading.

At the same time, during his reign, engineers worked arduously on a chess engine. Convinced they were, that one day, the computer would defeat even the greatest player of all time. It was going to be a perfect fight. The best human vs. the best machine. Either man or machine would have to bend the knee.

Shiba Inu Balance On Exchange Has Been Falling Since November
 
As pointed out by analyst Ali in a new post on X, a large amount of Shiba Inu has left exchanges since November. The relevant metric here is the “Balance on Exchanges,” which keeps track of the total amount of SHIB that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.
 
When the value of this metric goes up, it means that the investors are depositing a net number of coins to these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons why investors would make such transfers is for selling purposes, this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the asset’s price.

2023 Witnesses a 15.93% Bitcoin Surge, Ranking Seventh in December Gains
 
Indeed, Santa granted bitcoin enthusiasts a 15.93% boost this December, yet it’s unlikely to be remembered as an official ‘Bitcoin Santa Claus rally‘ akin to the ones seen in 2017 and 2011. From Dec. 1, 2023, to the eve of Christmas, BTC soared from $37,721 per unit to an impressive peak of $43,730.

Why ADA Price Is Set To Enjoy A Massive Rally
 
In a video posted on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, identified the order book level as one of the indicators of an ADA rally. According to him, the current order book level on the charts is posing as an area of resistance.

Baseless Claims
 
The Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange, MEXC, has described allegations that it is unilaterally freezing users’ accounts as “baseless claims” being propagated by “individuals with ulterior motives.” In a statement, the MEXC team said it vehemently opposes attempts to defame it or disseminate false narratives and may institute legal proceedings against those behind the rumors.

 This came around a year after the British Government–while Sunak was still Chancellor of the Exchequer–published plans “to make Britain a global hub for cryptoasset technology and investment.”

                              <span>The Japanese government has approved a tax reform that removes some crypto taxes for corporations and conglomerates. The reform, discussed since early December, removes the unrealized gains taxes on crypto holdings for companies, paving the way for them to hold crypto assets more consistently.
Japanese Government Approves Tax Reform to Eliminate Unrealized Gains Tax
The Japanese cabinet convened to approve the FY2018 tax reform, which includes a series of modifications to rules affecting companies in the cryptocurrency area. The reform included a change that removed the “unrealized gains” crypto tax that mandated companies to pay tribute based on the price change of crypto assets each fiscal year.
A change that eliminated this tax for companies’ self-issued cryptocurrencies had already been approved earlier this year, but with this modification, crypto companies can now hold crypto issued by third parties without paying the unrealized gains taxes.
However, cryptocurrency sales and purchases will continue to be taxed. This opposes the petition of the Japan Crypto Asset Business Association, which asked for eliminating the tax on crypto exchanges. According to local media, the measure will contribute to a general reduction in tax-derived income for June 2024, expected to be the largest since 1989.
The reform, which had been in discussion since early December, is directed to make it easier for corporations to add crypto to their treasury without paying for simply holding it. Japan is one of the few countries that applies this unrealized crypto gains tax, prompting companies to hold these assets in other countries.
Nonetheless, even after this approval, the tax reform will have to be presented to the Diet next year and will have to be passed by both houses.

                              <span>Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, has some wise words to share in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. According to him, if spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) become extremely popular, they may even destroy the crypto itself.
 
A prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, Hayes expressed his worries in a blog post on December 23. He highlights the inherent worth of Bitcoin, which stems from its ever-changing character. But according to Hayes, the real danger is coming from spot ETFs that are meant to take in assets and store them in a vault.

El Salvador Passes Bitcoin Citizenship Law
The government of El Salvador has passed a law that allows foreign investors to become Salvadoran citizens. The project, approved with Bukele’s Nuevas Ideas party majority in the Congress, offers foreigners the possibility of sidestepping the ordinary requirements to receive Salvadoran citizenship by making Bitcoin donations to social and economic programs in the country, without mentioning a determined number.

                              <span>Arthur Hayes, former CEO of Bitmex and cryptocurrency market analyst, pondered about the success of an upcoming spot bitcoin ETF and its effect on the future of bitcoin. Hayes states that the popularity of these ETF derivatives might concentrate the custody of all the bitcoin in a few hands that won’t move it, forcing miners to capitulate due to a lack of activity in the blockchain.
Arthur Hayes Believes ETFs Might Cause the Demise of Bitcoin
Former Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes believes that the success of an upcoming spot bitcoin ETF might endanger the existence of the Bitcoin network. In his most recent blog post, “Expression,” Hayes presents a hypothetical situation in which bitcoin is all in the hands of a few financial firms, like Blackrock.
If this happens, Hayes anticipates this will destroy bitcoin as a store of value, given that it is different from all of the assets traded in financial markets until now.
Hayes argued:
Bitcoin is the first monetary asset in human history that exists only if it moves. But if there was never another Bitcoin transaction between two entities, miners would be unable to afford the energy it costs to secure the network.
The result of this would be the shutdown of the whole Bitcoin network due to the starvation of miners who will receive fees only from bitcoin transactions after the subsidy ends circa 2140.
Hayes adds that this could happen if users come to value bitcoin as a financial asset more than a store of value, favoring the purchase of derivatives instead of the cryptocurrency. However, if bitcoin suffers this fate, Hayes anticipates the birth of a similar asset to allow people to transact in a non-state-owned financial system.
“Hopefully, the second time around, we will learn not to hand our private keys to the baldies,” he concluded.
