Trading Volumes On Uniswap And Coinbase
 
Taking to X (Formerly Twitter) Bitwise researcher Ryan Rasmussen revealed that Uniswap performed better than Coinbase in terms of spot trading volumes in 2023.
 
 
Uniswap’s trading volume first surpassed Coinbase’s trading volume in February, and despite the decline in trading volume since then, Uniswap still managed to be ahead of the largest crypto exchange in the United States.
 
Coinbase’s daily trading volume has consistently been above $1 billion since then, while Uniswap’s daily trading volume has come out above $1.4 billio…</span>

                              <span>Dogecoin moved closer to a key support level on Friday, as the meme coin slipped for a second straight session. Today’s decline comes as the global crypto market cap edged lower, falling 0.77% lower as of writing. Toncoin was on the other side of the spectrum, hitting a one-week high.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin closed in on a collision with a key price floor on Friday, as the meme coin fell for a second straight day.
 
DOGE/USD dropped to a low of $0.0619 earlier in today’s session, following a high of $0.06308 the day prior.
 
As a result, dogecoin was a stone’s throw away from a support point at the $0.06000 mark.
 
 
This turn in sentiment comes after the price was unable to break out of a resistance level of $0.06500 on Wednesday.
 
The relative strength index (RSI) also failed to breach a ceiling of its own at 36.00, and is now tracking at 33.37.
 
Should this decline continue, bears will likely look to exit once the index reaches a floor around 32.00.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
On the other hand, toncoin (TON) was mostly in the green during today’s session, as price remained near a one-week high.
 
Following a low of $1.40 on Thursday, TON/USD peaked at $1.44 earlier in the day, its highest point since last Thursday.
 
The move saw the token near a resistance level of $1.50, a point which was last hit on August 16.
 
 
Sentiment has somewhat shifted as the day progressed, as a result of the RSI hitting a ceiling of 58.00.
 
Currently, price strength is tracking at 54.44, and seems to be heading towards a floor around the 50.00 region.
 
In the event this target is reached, TON will likely move below $1.20.

                              <span>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have jointly announced a set of proposed regulations focusing on the sale and exchange of digital assets by brokers. The is part of the broader strategy set forth by the Biden-Harris Administration&#x27;s bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), in attempt &quot;to close the tax gap, address the tax evasion risks posed by digital assets, and help ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules.&quot;
&quot;These proposed regulations would require brokers, including digital asset trading platforms, digital asset payment processors, and certain digital asset hosted wallets, to file information returns, and furnish payee statements, on dispositions of digital assets effected for customers in certain sale or exchange transactions,&quot; said the IRS.
These regulations obligate brokers of digital assets to report the specific sales and exchanges of their customers. The regulations also introduce the requirement for brokers to furnish a new Form 1099-DA, to help users determine if they owe taxes.
The implementation timeline specified in the regulations states that brokers would start reporting information on sales and exchanges of digital assets beginning in 2026, for transactions that occurred during the year 2025. The Joint Committee on Taxation&#x27;s estimation is that these IIJA provisions could generate nearly $28 billion in revenue over 10 years.
The Treasury Department and the IRS are actively soliciting feedback from affected taxpayers, industries, and other stakeholders on the proposed regulations. Written comments will be accepted until October 30, 2023, and the agencies have scheduled a public hearing on November 7, 2023, with a potential follow-up session on November 8, 2023, if the demand necessitates it.</span>

This comes on the heels of Kraken’s recent addition of PYUSD trading options, marking a significant stride in the stablecoin’s mainstream adoption.
 
“Coinbase Assets” took to Twitter to confirm the news, stating, “Asset added to the roadmap today: PayPal USD (PYUSD). The Ethereum network (ERC-20 token) contract address for PayPal USD (PYUSD) is 0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8.”

                              <span>Several events in FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings continue to unravel as the crypto exchange seeks to settle its creditors and possibly restart. The latest of these is that the company has moved to protect its remaining assets with the help of Galaxy Digital.
 
FTX Seeks To Protect Crypto Assets
 
According to a filing dated August 24, crypto exchange FTX has filed a motion seeking the court to authorize its Investment Services Agreement with Galaxy Digital. 
 
 
The motion, tagged the “Coin Management and Monetization Motion,” noted that the Debtor’s board of directors had selected Galaxy Asset Management to provide investment manager services to the digital assets that form an account of the company. 
 
This forms part of the company’s plans to hedge against the volatility of its digital as…</span>

From Cold Storage to Cold Reality: The Dramatic Decline of Prime Trust
 
In a declaration filed along with the bankruptcy petition on August 24, Prime Trust’s current CEO Jor Law summarized the company’s slide into insolvency. He stated that prior management engaged in lavish spending despite depressed revenues during the “crypto winter” of 2022.
 
This included $10.5 million in expenses against just $3.1 million in revenue in October 2022. The company also lost $6 million in customer funds and $2 million of its own corporate treasury money after investi…</span>

the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by trading volume, in the past  
week has been reaching out to digital asset projects on its

According

projects would be open to allocating up to 5% of their circulating tokens into  
its savings pools in exchange for interest earnings. 
A Race for More Volume?

                              <span>Bitcoin marginally declined during Friday’s session, concurrent with the ongoing Federal Reserve symposium in Jackson Hole. The Chair of the Fed, Jerome Powell will be speaking at the annual meeting, and providing guidance on the upcoming policy decision. Ethereum also consolidated today.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin briefly fell below the $26,000 level on Friday, as traders readied themselves for Jerome Powell’s speech.
 
BTC/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,914.93 earlier in the day, following a high of $26,406.15 on Thursday.
 
The decline saw bitcoin move one step closer to its recent support point of $25,600, a level it has tracked for most of the week.
 
 
Bitcoin chart by TradingView
 

 
 
From the chart, the decline comes after the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) was unable to move beyond a ceiling of 30.00 during yesterday’s session.
 
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 25.89, which remains highly oversold, and could be heading even lower, to a floor of 20.00.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also slipped today, as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moved below a recent price floor.
 
After trading at a high of $1,668.82 on Thursday, ETH/USD bottomed out at $1,641.63 earlier in the day.
 
This resulted in ETH sliding below a support level at $1,650, which has proven to be a zone of high volatility.

Similar to BTC above, today’s drop comes after the RSI collided with a resistance point of 33.00 on Thursday.
 
The index now sits at a reading of 30.66, with the next floor over 10.00 points away.

While FTX asserts that its core operations remain unaffected, the incident has raised concerns about the security of personal information within the crypto industry.
 
FTX wasted no time in addressing the breach and reassuring its customers. The exchange promptly announced that its own account passwords, systems, and funds had not been compromised.

This has prompted the likes of Cardano Founder, Charles Hoskinson, to give his opinion on the reason for the SEC’s actions.

In a new post on X (formerly Twitter), Julio Moreno, the Head of Research at the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQaunt, has talked about whether Binance is experiencing a bank run or not.
 
Binance has been a hot topic in the news lately, as the platform has been under regulatory fire from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the latest development being that an action from the Department of Justice (DOJ) may be imminent.
 
There were also earlier rumors that the exchange had been involved in a Bitcoin selloff, in order to prop up the value of its native token, BNB, after the market had gone …</span>
