EVM Chains Face Surge in Token Inscriptions
 
Over the past year, Bitcoin inscriptions have surged in popularity due to the advent of Ordinals, significantly impacting the Bitcoin blockchain. This controversial method has led to a sharp increase in transaction costs and a congested mempool, reigniting debates reminiscent of 2017’s block size war.
 
The phenomenon has now extended to Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. Despite the initial skepticism about introducing inscriptions on smart contract-capable blockchains, the demand for EVM inscriptions has been so hig…</span>

SHIB Burn Rate Spike 420%
 
According to data from the Shibburn website, the SHIB burn rate saw another 421% increase in the last 24 hours. This spike comes as Shiba Inu community members change from their pattern from the previous day, which saw only a little over 1 million tokens burned.
 
 
This time around, there have been more than 5.3 million tokens incinerated, which brought about the 421% spike reported by the website. Interestingly, the total burns came from less than 10 addresses. As the burn tracking website shows, there have been only six b…</span>

                              <span>In a significant development, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) convened with applicants seeking approval for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) today, according to Eleanor Terrett and Charles Gasparino of FOX Business. 



Terrett revealed sources who attended the meeting said the SEC was &quot;making sure everyone is doing cash creates,&quot; and &quot;asked issuers to remove all hints of in-kind redemptions from their filings.&quot; This meeting assumes paramount importance amid the ongoing discussions and evaluations regarding the approval of such ETFs.
Terrett&#x27;s post hinted at the collaborative nature of the meeting, suggesting efforts to bring all stakeholders onto the same page regarding the nuances, prerequisites, and potential implications associated with their spot Bitcoin ETF applications. While details about all the specifics remain undisclosed, the meeting likely focused on addressing concerns, clarifying regulatory expectations, and streamlining the evaluation process for these ETF applications.
The SEC&#x27;s engagement with applicants reflects a commitment to comprehensively assess the viability and regulatory compliance of the proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs. The outcome of this meeting could significantly influence the trajectory of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, potentially paving the way for a more structured framework for institutional participation in this burgeoning industry. 
As market participants await further developments, this meeting stands as a crucial milestone in the potential approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Yesterday, FOX Business reported that BlackRock made receiving an approval for their spot Bitcoin ETF a &quot;key corporate priority,&quot; and that the ETFs will have a SEC decision by January 10.</span>

                              <span>Recently, the seasoned financial analyst and trader Peter Brandt has been increasingly expressive about crypto assets, with a particular focus on bitcoin and ethereum. On Dec. 21, 2023, Brandt reaffirmed his stance regarding the anticipated Bitcoin reward halving set for April 2024. He contends that the halving is overly sensationalized and will only exert a temporary impact on bitcoin’s price.
 
Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Dismisses Bitcoin Halving Buzz as Exaggerated Frenzy
 
Back at the end of July 2023, Peter Brandt had already conveyed his viewpoint, dismissing the forthcoming bitcoin halving as an inconsequential “non-event.” He reiterated this perspective on Thursday, taking to X (previously known as Twitter) to issue a statement about the halving event.

We’re less than 30,000 blocks out from the halvening and the stakes couldn’t be higher. For many Bitcoin mining operators, this will make or break the bets made during this Bitcoin epoch. Did I grow too fast? Can I handle a catastrophic drop in hashprice? Will my operations get rekt by my current energy contract? Bitcoin itself remains indifferent. The halvening is inevitable, encoded by Satoshi at Bitcoin’s genesis and enforced by nodes across the world. The blocks will continue to flow and there will be b…</span>

                              <span>In a recent interview with Fox News, renowned economist Harry Dent issued a dire prediction for the global economy, forecasting 2024 to be the year of the most significant financial crash in living memory. Citing a combination of overvalued markets, excessive stimulus spending, and artificial inflation of asset prices, Dent’s analysis paints a grim picture of the near future. With his reputation for contrarian yet often accurate forecasts, Dent’s warnings carry weight in financial circles.

The Messari seventh annual crypto report titled “Crypto Theses for 2024” is a 200-page report covering a range of topics from Layer 1 blockchains to decentralized finance (DeFi), among other things. However, the Cardano community was quick to notice that the network was not mentioned and has taken to social media to demand answers.

                              <span>Phantom, the Web3 cryptocurrency wallet initially developed for Solana, has expanded to include Ethereum and Polygon, and is now introducing support for Bitcoin, Ordinal inscriptions, and BRC20 tokens. Users of Phantom have the ability to integrate their existing bitcoin wallets, allowing them to manage their Bitcoin-centric digital collectibles and fungible tokens through the Web3 platform’s interface.
 
From Solana to Bitcoin: Phantom Wallet’s Latest Expansion Embraces Inscriptions and BRC20s
 
In 2023, Ordinals and BRC20 tokens, developed atop Bitcoin, have gained considerable traction, leading numerous companies to adopt the supporting infrastructure. As of December 21, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain boasts over 50 million inscriptions.
 
On Wednesday, Phantom, the Web3 wallet that secured $109 million in Series B funding from key investors last year, announced its foray into the Bitcoin realm. Phantom acknowledges Bitcoin’s foundational role, stating that without it, there would be no Solana, Ethereum, or Web3.
 
“Introducing Bitcoin on Phantom,” the company said in a post shared on X. “You can now buy, sell, trade, transfer, and HODL Bitcoin, Ordinals, and BRC20 tokens with your favorite multi-chain wallet.”
 
 
Phantom’s integration of Ordinals and BRC20s coincides with a surge in demand for Bitcoin digital collectibles and fungible tokens. Recent data from cryptoslam.io reveals that Bitcoin-based NFT sales have exceeded $400 million in the past week.
 
Phantom’s Bitcoin feature is currently in beta and available on an opt-in basis. Users can also link with the NFT marketplaces Magic Eden and Unisat, and Phantom indicates that additional “trusted” applications will be introduced shortly.

The MEXC exchange funded this entire giveaway, as they went against Grimace’s user base and listed the token on their futures market without approval.
 
The Start of It All: The Complete Story of the Dispute
 
In spring 2023, Grimace emerged as one of the year’s standout crypto projects, quickly gaining fame and enriching its early backers, who were also actively donating to charity. Money was freely given away on the streets, and competitions in poker, chess, Dota 2, Counter-Strike, and even rap battles were held, each with prizes in the tens of thousands of dollars.
 
Grimace first appeared on MEXC on June 12, 2023. Initially, users appreciated the exchange for it…</span>

                              <span>In a groundbreaking statement, Argentina&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Diana Mondino, has confirmed the country&#x27;s stance on embracing Bitcoin for contractual agreements.



Mondino&#x27;s declaration outlined the government&#x27;s willingness to accept and formalize contracts denominated in Bitcoin, heralding a pivotal moment for legal recognition of BTC within Argentina. The move demonstrates Argentina&#x27;s progressive approach towards integrating Bitcoin in the country.
&quot;And also any other crypto and/or species such as kilos of steer or liters of milk,&quot; Mondino continued. &quot;Art 766. - Obligation of the debtor. The debtor must deliver the corresponding amount of the designated currency, whether the currency is legal tender in the Republic or not.&quot;
This announcement arrives a month after Javier Milei, who has made very positive comments about Bitcoin in the past, won Argentina&#x27;s presidential candidacy. Milei has previously stated, &quot;The central bank is a scam, a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax.” Then saying Bitcoin &quot;represents the return of money to its original creator, the private sector,” and that &quot;it prevents politicians from robbing you through inflation.&quot;
The Minister&#x27;s assertion further underlines Argentina&#x27;s efforts to leverage the potential of Bitcoin to stimulate economic growth and innovation. By accepting Bitcoin as a valid form of contractual agreement, the government aims to foster an environment conducive to investment and business development within the country.
While the details regarding the implementation and legal nuances remain to be outlined, Mondino&#x27;s statement marks a crucial step forward in legitimizing Bitcoin as a recognized means of conducting formal agreements within Argentina. The move may also serve as a catalyst, encouraging other nations to consider similar initiatives in integrating Bitcoin into their legal frameworks.</span>

the global financial technology firm and issuer of USDC and EURC, has announced  
the attainment of a conditional registration as a Digital Asset Service

European

To

Crypto Founders&#x27; Assets  
Frozen amid Hedge Fund Collapse
The freeze  
comes as Three Arrows Capital faces liquidation. The firm was once one of the  
largest crypto-focused hedge funds before a series of risky bets led to its  
demise last year, amid a broader crypto market rout.
According  
to liquidator Teneo, the freeze order was issued by a British Virgin Islands  
court. Teneo estimates that 3AC creditors are owed about $3.3 billion. The

As Scottish economist and philosopher David Hume observed in A Treatise of Human Nature, nothing we know about what is true can tell us what ought to be true and nothing we know about what ought to be true can tell us what is true. The world of objective fact and moral truth are entirely separate. Hume called this the is/ought problem and his argument that descriptive and normative reasoning should be separated is known as Hume’s guillotine. 
Hume’s guillotine is a philosophical razor – a rule of thumb for reasoning about the world. It is a way of cutting apart two lines of reasoning that become entangled when they intertwine. An argument where one side argues about what is true and the other side argues about what ought to be true is a useless argument. Thos…</span>
