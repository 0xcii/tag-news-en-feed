                              <span>The crypto market has had an eventful 2022. With the numerous collapses and bankruptcies that were witnessed this year alone, it comes as no surprise that the market is marking the end on a low note. However, as another year is ushered in, there are numerous cryptocurrencies in the space that offer opportunities in the coming year. Here is a list of assets that have proven and will continue to prove themselves.
 
Bitcoin (BTC)
 
Naturally, bitcoin tops the list of top cryptos to look out for in the new year. Being the pioneer of the space, the digital asset still commands a large share of the market, as well as multiple bull runs with performances that have outpaced anyone’s expectations.

                              <span>Despite holding off to date, a Bitcoin ban by the EU could be on the horizon. But Bitcoin doesn’t ask for permission.
This is an opinion article by Guglielmo Cecero, the legal manager of European bitcoin investment app Relai, and Raphael Schoen, the content lead at Relai.
Bitcoin is under attack. It is increasingly seen as a “dirty currency.” Elon Musk’s Tesla, Wikipedia, Greenpeace and other organizations have stopped accepting BTC for their products or as a means to donate money. 
Musk, who is not only one of the richest but also one of the most controversial people on this planet, has said: “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels, and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.” Ouch.

However, there is, in part, an NFT outlook by which 1 ETH equals 1 ETH, meaning that NFT prices are tracked in crypto terms, rather than fiat amounts.
 This perspective pays a little less attention to short-term crypto prices, preferring to focus on what is being built in the NFT ecosystem, while maintaining an underlying confidence in the long-term future of ETH, and some of the other cryptocurrencies in which NFTs are priced. 
 A major benefit to this mindset is that it’s more natural to maintain a relatively optimistic sentiment when that sentiment is not bound up with day-to-day price movements. Set free from endless market analysis, it b…</span>

                              <span>Data shows the bear market has also hit Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) hard, as the total value locked in the sector has declined by 76%.
 
Total Value Locked In Ethereum DeFi Now Only Around $23.1 Billion
 
Decentralized Finance (or DeFi as it’s most commonly known) includes all types of financial services that are done on the blockchain. Like other entities on the blockchain, DeFi is public and doesn’t involve any centralized party to get things done (as transactions are peer-to-peer).
 
The “total value locked” (TVL) is a metric that measures the total amount of capital that has currently been deposited by users in DeFi protocols. The below chart shows how the TVL of DeFi built on the Ethereum blockchain has changed over the course of the year 2022:

Consequently, World Gold Council (WGC) statistics show the demand for gold by central banks has risen at the fastest pace in 55 years. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo’s head of real asset strategy, John LaForge, contends that when silver starts outperforming gold, it usually signals it is “closer to a bull market in precious metals versus the other way.”

Last June, the American economist drew parallels between the cryptocurrency craze and the real estate bubble of the mid-2000s, stating that consumers’ belief in crypto assets is comparable to their enthusiasm in the US home market prior to its collapse.
 
Fast forward six months, Krugman has compared the crypto to Tesla and its stocks.
 
On Tuesday, Krugman wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times regarding Tesla, bitcoin, and their massive market prices.
 
 
In his article, he inquired:
 

“Did the Tesla story ever make sense?” 
 
He added:
 

“Tesla and bitcoin may have more in common than you think.”

This trails back to 2021, when central banks across the

                              <span>Who will be the next crypto top honchos to fall? Will it be the Winklevoss twins?
 
Investors have filed a lawsuit against embattled Gemini and its founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, accusing them of fraud and other crimes, reports disclosed Tuesday.
 
A group of investors filed a class-action lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, claiming that the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange offered unregistered securities in the form of interest-bearing accounts.
 
According to reports, investors alleged in the lawsuit that Gemini and the Winklevoss twins violated the Exchange Act and accused the twins and their crypto exchange of fraud.

Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at Arcane Research has published a detailed analysis of this.
 
“No matter how you look at it in terms of trading activity, Binance dominates the crypto market,” the analyst says, further stating that the exchange led by Changpeng Zhao is the clear winner of 2022.
 
As the Arcane Research analyst notes, Binance captures 92% of the Bitcoin spot volume. Remarkably, the exchange occupied only 42% of BTC spot volume in January 2022. After the exchange removed trading fees on its BTC spot pairs this summer, the growth exploded.
