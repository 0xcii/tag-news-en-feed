                              <span>Big tech giants such as Microsoft, Tencent, Sony, Nintendo, and others joined the Web3 space in the past two years. A new report from crypto analytics firm Coingecko dives into the sector and the projects backed by these major companies to answer a question: how are they investing in the nascent industry?
 
 
How Microsoft And Nintendo Are Investing In Web3?
 
According to the report, Microsoft and other big tech companies employ different strategies to inject capital into the Web3 space. The data reveals that most companies, or 75.9%, chose a “measured and indirect approach.”
 
In that way, the investors can cover themselves in case of “adverse headlines” or if the project faces any particular challenges while keeping the benefit of backing blockchain-based companies. In other words, Nint…</span>

Transactions can be slow and costly, making mainchain settlement less efficient for everyday transactional use. Enter the Lightning Network, an innovative solution that has the potential to make Bitcoin unstoppable. In the latest episode of Bitcoin Backstage, we explore the concept behind the Lightning Network, its role in Bitcoin&#x27;s growth, the involvement of David Marcus with LightSpark, and the unstoppable nature of Bitcoin itself.

Dogecoin And Other Meme Coins Have Seen Declining Interest Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, meme coins have been occupying a smaller part of the trader interest in the cryptocurrency sector recently.
 
The relevant indicator here is “social dominance,” but to understand it, the social volume, a metric that it’s based on, must be looked at first. The “social volume” is basically a measure of the amount of discussion around a given coin that users on the major social media platforms are participating in.

                              <span>Coinbase has received a regulatory stamp of approval to start offering perpetual futures trading to retail crypto traders outside the U.S., opening up access to the $5.5 trillion global derivatives market.
 
Coinbase Extends Perpetual Futures Trading to Retail Traders Abroad
 
The Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) granted Coinbase International Exchange, the company’s new non-U.S. exchange, a license last week to extend its futures trading services to retail investors across the world, except residents in the U.S. With the approval, Coinbase is poised to expand its derivatives services to more customers globally through its Coinbase Advanced platform in the coming weeks.
 
“As the most trusted and safest name in crypto, Coinbase will operate with maximum transparency, employ a robust risk framework, and meet the high-bar regulatory and compliance standards of the BMA,” the Coinbase announcement said.
 
The company sees regulatory approval as an opportunity to further its mission of updating the global financial system by providing users around the world with more access to regulated derivatives. The announcement discloses that Coinbase will follow rigorous risk management and compliance standards set by Bermuda regulators.
 
 
The move comes as other exchanges face increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States by regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase said its futures contracts have already seen over $5.5 billion in notional trading volume since launching earlier this year.
 
The San Francisco-based company said its futures trading services will only be available to eligible retail investors outside the U.S. after passing the company’s assessment checks. Coinbase said its futures accounts will be backed by usd coin (USDC) reserves and managed by an experienced risk team.
