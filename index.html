                              <span>Solana is tracking higher at spot rates as bulls appear keen to reclaim the 2024 highs printed in March. Amid this, one analyst is confident that SOL will extend gains versus Ethereum, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart.
 
Solana To Outperform Ethereum? 
 
Sharing a SOLETH chart on X, the analyst notes that though prices have been consolidating, SOL bulls have the upper hand. So far, a clear “Cup and Handle” pattern is forming. 
 
 
While it does not guarantee higher prices, the pattern historically prints out, preceding a bull run and breakout above the local resistance.

Cardano Founder Says “Vote Crypto”
 
In a recent YouTube video, Hoskinson raised concerns regarding the current US administration’s anti-crypto stance.

“Bitcoin L2s” are the hottest thing on the street. People are using a bunch of jargon to distract users from trust assumptions and shill Bitcoin Season 2.
Why all the sudden energy? See, about a year ago, some teams figured out how to use Bitcoin as a data availability layer for rollups. Others have been working on improving trust assumptions related to bridges (aka two-way peg). The research has been making great progress, and a lot of projects think we’ll have rollup-like blockchains in production by 2025.
