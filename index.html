Seychelles-based exchange Huobi has seen a significant increase in net outflows over the past 24 hours, according to Nansen data.

A memo obtained by The Information states that HQ Digital is being shut down due to the “general economic environment and the ongoing crypto winter, which is creating significant headwinds for the industry,” and that the company may revisit the project in the future.
