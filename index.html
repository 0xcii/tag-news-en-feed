The cumulative inflows for the year-to-date period have now reached $5.2 billion.
 
According to the firm’s Head of Research, James Butterfill, the recent surge in capital inflow, along with positive price trends, has led to a notable rise in the company’s total assets under management (AuM), which now stands at $67 billion, representing the “highest level” recorded “since December 2021.”
