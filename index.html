Families Of Detained Binance Executives Seek Answers
 
As previously reported by Bitcoinist, the arrest appears to be related to Nigeria’s broader move to ban cryptocurrency exchanges due to the drastic devaluation of the country’s national currency, the naira. 
 
The Nigerian government has accused cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance of devaluing its currency and facilitating “illicit flows” of funds. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla arrived in Abuja on February 25 to address the government’s concerns.

Dogecoin Has More Users Than Shiba Inu And PEPE
 
Per data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, Dogecoin has 6.3 million holders compared to SHIB’s 1.3 and PEPE’s 170,000 holders. This insight further establishes DOGE as the most preferred among all other meme coins. This is also significant as the adoption level of these crypto tokens could influence their prices.
