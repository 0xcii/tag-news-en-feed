                              <span>In a surprising twist, Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of defunct crypto lender Genesis Capital, has contested the settlement agreement reached with the New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) office, citing alleged violations of the Bankruptcy Code. 
 
The legal saga, which saw the NYAG accusing Genesis and its collaborators of defrauding investors for over $3 billion, took an unexpected turn when DCG filed a court objection to the settlement.
 
Violation Of Bankruptcy Code? 
 
DCG’s objection, outlined in a recent court filing issued on Wednesday, revolves around the belief that the proposed settlement allows the Debtors (Genesis) to redistribute value from lower classes to preferred creditors, thereby violating the absolute priority rule. 
 
The objection argues that the New…</span>

Though Back has previously spoken publicly about the emails, hinting at the details of the conversation, and in particular how he neglected to read the white paper at first, the emails represent the first time that the full text has been made available.

                              <span>Today at 11:30a in Waco, Texas, the Texas Blockchain Council and Riot Platforms, Inc., asked a Federal District Judge Alan Albright for a temporary restraining order blocking the Energy Information Administration from enforcing their &quot;emergency&quot; survey.
At that hearing, the attorneys for the Government offered a voluntary declaration by EIA Administrator DeCarolis, offering a four-week pause on enforcement and collection. Judge Albright, recognizing that the Government&#x27;s offer here was little more than an empty promise without some sort of enforcement mechanism, directed the Government to work with the Plaintiffs to craft a negotiated order that would fully bind the Government to:

Take down the survey for the agreed four-week period;
Provide notice that anyone who hasn&#x27;t yet complied, that they don&#x27;t need to comply right now; and
Provide an affirmation that any information which has been received so far, or which is received in the interim, shall be sequestered and not utilized by the Agency.

Also, this order will be National in scope, so every miner in the US is covered.
If the Government can&#x27;t reach an agreement by 3pm Central today, the Judge indicated that he would issue a Temporary Restraining Order with the same effect as the above, but would accelerate the timetable to the permanent injunction hearing.
We&#x27;ll know more in a few hours when the final order is entered, but it looks like for now at least, the EIA has been stalled in their (allegedly illegal) &quot;emergency&quot; data collection.
Here is a link to the case files.

Taking to X, Woo noted that Bitcoin soaks in an average of $607 million daily as an asset in new investor demand. In comparison, only $46 million of new supply is being created through mining. 
 
Bitcoin Receives Over $607 Million In Value Everyday, What Happens After Halving?
 
The Bitcoin network is a proof-of-work platform reliant on miners for security and decentralization, rendering its transactions censorship-resistant and global. Though there are concerns about centralization, it appears that the broad network of miners holds more importance for the platform, explaining its colossal valuation.

The analysis conducted by JPMorgan’s research team, led by Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, revealed that the resurgence of “small-scale investors,” often referred to as ‘mom-and-pop’ traders, has been instrumental in propelling popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to two-year peak this month.
 
 
This resurgence follows the market decline experienced in January, indicating renewed optimism among retail participants in the crypto space. The JPMorgan team noted:
