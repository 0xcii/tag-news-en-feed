However, this is beginning to change as investors, especially whales, are back to filling up their bags once again. The most notable of these buys is a whale who bought 692 trillion SHIB from the Crypto.com exchange.
 
Whale Spends $19 Million On Shiba Inu
 
A significant Shiba Inu whale transaction was seen on the blockchain in the early hours of Monday and has caught investor attention over this time. The transaction which was reported by the on-chain whale tracking platform Whale Alert, was carrying a whopping 692.4 trillion SHIB.

&quot;Crypto regulation&quot; itself is somewhat of an oxymoron.  
Although built on the principle of peer-to-peer transfer, the market has

                              <span>Most people who understand bitcoin know that there are two kinds of bitcoin. One is bitcoin, the asset which has a fixed supply and is quite volatile, and the second kind of Bitcoin, the network and protocol that maintains an immutable ledger that has never been hacked and is bullet proof, bomb proof and tank proof. It is my opinion that too much focus is placed on the asset and not nearly enough on the network, protocol and immutable ledger. 
While listening to a recent podcast Peter McCormack had with Dhruv Bansal they discussed the network and protocol in a new way. 
I really liked Dhruv’s framing of how to view the fixed supply of bitcoin. The two versions can be simplified as follows:

                              <span>The crypto market could be on the cusp of a major boom, according to Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of blockchain company Ripple.
 
 
In an interview with CNBC, Garlinghouse predicted that the total market capitalization of the crypto market could double by the end of 2024, reaching a staggering $5 trillion.
 
 
“I’ve been around this industry for a long time, and I’ve seen these trends come and go,” Garlinghouse said. “I’m very optimistic. I think the macro trends, the big picture things like the ETFs, they’re driving for the first time real institutional money.” 
 
This bullish outlook hinges on several key factors, including the recent arrival of the first US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the upcoming bitcoin halving event.

Bitcoin Price Displays Rare Technical Pattern
 
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, a crypto analyst and Bitcoin enthusiast identified as ‘TechDev’ disclosed a rare technical pattern observed in BTC’s price movements. Sharing a price chart illustrating Bitcoin’s historical price fluctuations since 2011, TechDev unveiled a distinct correlation in the cryptocurrency’s price movements across 2013, 2017 and 2022.

Predicts “$170000 for this cycle.” 🚀 pic.twitter.com/0uE4EAmwgS
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 8, 2024
  
  
  
Scaramucci has been a vocal Bitcoin proponent, with Skybridge investing heavily in Bitcoin. He cited increasing mainstream and institutional adoption as key drivers of Bitcoin&#x27;s growth.
The prominent financier and former White House Communications Director highlighted the major impact of SEC-approved Bitcoin spot ETFs in unlocking billions in new investments this year. He compared the over $10 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows in Q1 favourably to the slower adoption of early gold ETFs.
Scaramucci also discussed the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will reduce daily supply and potentially dramatically impact prices. He believes the market has not priced in the halving, predicting a supply squeeze.
Although volatile, Scaramucci stressed Bitcoin&#x27;s inflation-hedging ability over a 4-year investment horizon, touting its digital gold narrative. He sees potential for Bitcoin&#x27;s market cap to reach 50% of gold&#x27;s valuation.
Scaramucci has been an avid Bitcoin proponent, with Skybridge taking an early institutional interest in Bitcoin. The firm led a high-profile push to offer Bitcoin exposure in 401(k) retirement plans, underscoring its commitment.
Despite some mainstream scepticism over the years, Scaramucci has maintained a bullish long-term outlook on Bitcoin as an emerging digital store of value. He cites generational wealth transfers and Bitcoin-friendly demographics as setting the stage for massive growth.
Scaramucci also touched on the FTX collapse, its impact, regulatory issues, and his optimism regarding the Bitcoin industry&#x27;s future maturation.</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin is a decentralized and finite digital currency, it’s verifiable by anyone anywhere in the world. This is the chief reason people have any interest in holding it at all. No one can dilute the supply, no one can counterfeit Bitcoin, it just works as an autonomous system that cannot be interfered with. So how do you participate in this system fully to verify everything?
If you think that simply using a Bitcoin wallet is enough to do so, I’m sorry to tell you that in reality that does not make you a full participant in the Bitcoin network. A wallet simply manages your private keys and helps you craft and sign your transactions, it does not actually participate in the full validation of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin Halving And Its Influence On Floor Prices Of Mining Machines
 
The halving is a periodic event on the Bitcoin network where the block rewards received by the miners for successfully solving a block are permanently cut in half. This event automatically goes through every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years.
 
The reason the halving exists is that the block rewards serve as the only way to introduce new BTC tokens into circulation, so by periodically slashing them in half, the cryptocurrency’s production rate can be diminished, and thus, its inflation can be controlled.

Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness a $94 million outflow, although outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may decelerate. Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase&#x27;s premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin&#x27;s all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance. Solana&#x27;s (SOL) decentralized exchange (DEX) achieves a monthly volume of $50 billion, with revenue soaring 30-fold. OKX announces support for a new Solana token standard. Despite expectations, Layer 2 activity remains sluggish post-Dencun, according to Vitalik Buterin.</span>
