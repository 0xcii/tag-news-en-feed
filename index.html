                              <span>Crypto analyst Javon Marks has remained a long-term believer in the XRP potential despite the crypto token’s underperformance since the start of the year. The analyst has again provided a bullish narrative for XRP, predicting that a massive rally is on the horizon. 
 
XRP Could Be Rise Between $15 and $20 Following Major Breakout
 
Marks mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that XRP rising to between $15 and $20 could be in play following an imminent breakout from the symmetrical triangle he highlighted on his chart. The analyst noted that these breakout price targets were his conservative ones without the “entirety of a full Logarithmic Follow through.”

This development marks a pivotal change in how developers can interact with the APIs by allowing them to execute real-time tests without the necessity for logins or real fund transactions.
 
Ripple Further Improves The Developer Experience
 
The “Try It” feature has been integrated into several API services including the Ripple Payments API, Smart Liquidation Service API, and the Report Service API. It is designed to provide immediate and realistic responses from a mock server, which mimics the behavior of the live servers in a controlled environment. This enables developers to send simulated API requests to any endpoint an…</span>

Both of these meme coins have seen their prices fall more than 7% already, leaving investors bewildered as to what is causing the crash.

Bitcoin Price sends Shiba Inu And Dogecoin Spiraling
 
While the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu price have been dropping, they are actually following the lead of Bitcoin, which has seen a lot of sell-offs recently. Bitcoin’s price drop to $57,000 was triggered by sell-offs from both the US and German government, causing the price to continue to drop.
