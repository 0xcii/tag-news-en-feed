                              <span>Considering the recent FTX collapse that triggered higher volatility in the crypto market, the world’s jurisdictions are revamping their crypto regulation framework. The EU remains at the end of the race by delaying voting on its crypto regulations bill known as MiCA. 
 
Notably, it was the second time the much-awaited bill, Markets in Crypto Regulations (MiCA), has been delayed. The parliament postponed the voting from November 2022 to February 2023 and now deferred it until April 2023. European legislators attributed translation issues as a reason behind both delays. 
 
 
The proposed EU regulations consist of a 380-page document that must be translated into all 24 languages spoken on the continent. The crypto regulation was initially drafted in English and will be published in all langu…</span>

                              <span>PRESS RELEASE. 2022 is an extraordinary year for the crypto industry, and it is also a year of struggle for both institutions and users. For CoinEx, 2022 was also a special year – quite a few crypto platforms collapsed overnight, and the panic continued as the market went through disruptive changes in Q3 and Q4 of the year. As a global crypto exchange, CoinEx is keenly aware that an exchange cannot survive bulls and bears, or achieve any progress, without consistent improvement of products and services.

                              <span>Shiba inu surged to a multi-month high on Wednesday, as the meme coin collided with a key price ceiling. Prices rose by as much as 17% in today’s session, as the global cryptocurrency market cap also trended higher. Polkadot was once again in the green, with the token hovering close to a two-month high of its own. 
 
Shiba Inu (SHIB)
 
Shiba inu (SHIB) rallied on Wednesday, as the meme coin surged to a two-month high, following declines on Tuesday.
 
Following a low of $0.00001053, SHIB/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.00001289 earlier in today’s session.
 
Today’s move saw shiba inu climb to its strongest point since early November, when prices last collided with a ceiling at the $0.00001290 level.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rebounded from a support point at 76.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at a level of 80.31, which is deep in overbought territory.
 
Earlier gains have also been wiped out, and the meme coin is currently trading at $0.0000124.
 
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) continued to trade near a two-month high, as the token remained near a key resistance level.
 
DOT/USD jumped to a high of $6.19 earlier in the day, before selling off following the release of U.S. retail sales figures.
 
Sales in the world’s largest economy fell by 1.1% in December, more than the decline of 0.8% many had expected.
 
 
As a result of the news, earlier gains have now been erased, with the price currently trading at $5.69.
 
The RSI has also given way, with price strength falling below a floor of 70.00, and currently tracking at 64.25.
 
Should this reversal worsen, DOT could be heading to a floor of $5.00.

                              <span>Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are once again leading the meme coin rally. With the crypto market seeing a significant recovery over the last week, all of the altcoins have followed suit. However, the meme coins have been significantly better recently as they have continued to see high gains at a time when the rest of the market is falling back.
 
Dogecoin, Shiba Inu See Gains
 
Although it cannot be said that meme coin season is back in full swing, the gains being recorded by the meme coins is a good indicator that they remain a formidable force in the sector. In the last 24 hours, most of the market has followed the footsteps of bitcoin and is now trading sideways, but coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are still in good standing.

After the successful rally, the burn rate on the SHIB network spiked to 613%. Shibburn, a platform that tracks burned SHIB tokens, confirmed the burn of more than 70 million SHIB tokens since the out-of-the-blue price rally in the market.

Vauld was among the firms impacted by the chain of events of last year. The crypto lending firm struggled following this leading to its suspension of withdrawals on the platform. It later filed for protection from its Singaporean creditors.
 
 
Vauld was previously granted three-month protection by its creditors, but a Singapore court has now extended the creditor protection period for Vauld. According to Bloomberg’s report, the court gave Vauld till February 28, 2023, to devise a revival plan on …</span>

SEC Admits Its Mistake in Recent Reveal
 
On January 17th, the Washington Examiner reported that the authority had been monitoring Green for years. This disclosure emerged because a financial regulator mistakenly forwarded an email to the blockchain company that contained the identities of over 650 individuals.
