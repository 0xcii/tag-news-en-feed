ZKasino Returns To Refund Investors
 
On Tuesday, ZKasino announced a 72-hour refund window for affected investors to reclaim their ‘rugged’ funds. In the announcement, the crypto platform’s founder, Derivatives Ape, revealed that Bridgers had until Friday, May 31, at 14:00 UTC to sign up and claim their funds.

Martinez explained in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin is currently encountering significant resistance between $0.166 and $0.171, a range where 75,500 addresses have acquired almost 10 billion DOGE tokens. The analyst claimed that Dogecoin’s price could double if it breaks out from this range, with $0.322 being the next “key resistance” for DOGE.
