                              <span>The class action lawsuit against Ripple Labs for selling XRP as an unregistered security is picking up steam today. The case, which is being litigated in the state of California, will see a class certification hearing today at 4:30 p.m. ET.
 
Class certification is a court order that gives plaintiffs the right to proceed on behalf of a particular class of plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit. If the judge already denies that order, the case, which has been ongoing since 2018, could end sooner than expected.
 
XRP community attorney John E. Deaton stated in a Twitter thread today that it is a Zoom hearing that he will be attending. Unlike the case of LBRY vs. the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the judge in charge of the case will not allow amicus attorneys to attend the oral…</span>

                              <span>Over 14 years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto unveiled the Bitcoin network to the world, creating the very first triple-entry bookkeeping system known to mankind. This technological wonder, with a current market value of $540 billion, ingeniously integrates encryption and mathematical formulas to fortify its security. In this exploration, we delve into two of the mathematical choices that underpin Bitcoin’s complex architecture, determining block rewards, transaction inputs and outputs, and mining difficulty adjustments, while also regulating the pace at which new blocks are discovered.

De-Dollarization Happening Faster Than People Realize, Says Economist
 
Economist Peter St Onge warned about the dire consequences of weaponizing the U.S. dollar in a video he posted on Twitter Monday. St Onge is a Research Fellow and the Mark A.

                              <span>Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he&#x27;s living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. &quot;I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re capitalist or you&#x27;re a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We&#x27;ve passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,&quot; he said. &quot;And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that&#x27;s outside of the traditional banking system.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Anthony Scaramucci of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital got burned by Sam Bankman-Fried: he co-hosted SALT conferences with FTX and sold a 30% stake in SkyBridge to FTX Ventures. And yet &quot;The Mooch&quot; tells Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott &quot;I&#x27;m more bullish now than I have ever been&quot; on crypto as an investment case. He discusses his frustration with SBF, how wrong he thinks politicians like Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler are about crypto and how to regulate it, what he sees happening next with adoption, and talks about Trump.
