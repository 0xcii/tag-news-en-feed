U.S. President Joe Biden Extends Anti-Russia Sanctions for One More Year

After seven failed attempts, this puts the price once again just below the current key level that separates BTC from $30,000.
 
A powerful price move will also benefit the broader crypto market as the rotation in altcoins aka altcoin season has still failed to materialize. Bitcoin and crypto investors should therefore keep an eye on key macro data in the week ahead.

Banking Woes for Binance US
While searching for a key banking partner, Binance US is now using the services of at least one intermediary bank for holding cash deposits from crypto traders on the platform. The services of an intermediary bank rather than a direct banking partner slow the exchange services for customers like deposits and withdrawals of US dollars.  

Previously, Binance US  used the services of Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank as its only two banking partners in the US for customer deposits. However, both the crypto-friendly banks failed last month: Silvergate declared voluntary liqui…</span>

The renowned economist listed a few factors for the diminishing status of the greenback such as its use as a political weapon by Washington, the introduction of currencies like the digital yuan, and America’s shrinking share of the global economy. 
 
United States’ Smaller Share in World Economy to Affect the Dollar
 
The role of the U.S. dollar will naturally decrease as the share of the United States in the planet’s economy becomes smaller and settlements in other currencies take hold, economics professor and Director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University Jeffrey Sachs predicted.

The UK branch of the popular fastfood chain caused a stir last week when it tweeted about wanting an “office doge,” following an unusual request by a cryptocurrency user for “We need doge.”
 
The Dogecoin community immediately reacted to the tweet, resulting in a surge in the price of this memecoin.

According to reports, the strategy Boonrin used entails inputting hypothetical queries and previous winning numbers on the chatbot. The generated numbers for his victorious draw were 57, 27, 29, and 99. Although the prize was not that big, Boonrin claimed to have generated lottery numbers using this method in the past.
 
Boonrin shared his experience using ChatGPT to generate lottery numbers on TikTok, where he has acquired a following and intends to disclose additional details.

Allianz’s research and analysis division published a report last week stating that the U.S. economy is “headed towards a crash landing.” Allianz is one of the world’s largest insurers with over 122 million private and corporate customers worldwide and more than 159,000 employees.

                              <span>Jim Rickards, an economist and the author of “Currency Wars,” says the U.S. Treasury is actually the biggest threat to the U.S. dollar’s status as a reserve currency. However, he cautioned that an increasing number of countries seeking alternatives to the dollar as a payment currency is also “a big deal,” emphasizing: “The dollar is being attacked from all sides.”
 
Jim Rickards on U.S. Dollar Losing Reserve Currency Status
 
Economist and “Currency Wars” author Jim Rickards has warned that despite China and other nations intensifying their efforts to reduce their dependency on the U.S. dollar, the USD’s biggest threat comes from the Treasury. He stressed on “Fox &amp; Friends Weekend” Saturday:
 

The greatest enemy of the dollar as a reserve currency is not all those other countries. It’s th…</span>

                              <span>The banking industry in the United States is still struggling after the collapse of three major banks. According to statistics, bank lending in the U.S. has dropped by close to $105 billion in the last two weeks of March, which is the largest decline on record. Additionally, Elon Musk, a Tesla executive and owner of Twitter, recently commented on trillions of dollars being withdrawn from banks into money market funds, and he insists that the “trend will accelerate.”
 
Statistics Still Show Glaring Signs of U.S. Bank Weaknesses; Musk Issues Warning
 
There are still plenty of signs showing that the U.S. banking system is feeling the aftermath of several high-profile bank collapses. During the first week of March, Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and Signature Bank (SBNY) closed d…</span>

                              <span>The U.S. Central Bank has issued an update regarding the Federal Reserve’s Fednow project, which is scheduled to commence in July. The Fed has responded to recent criticism of the Fednow service and asserts that the Fednow payment network is “neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash.”
 
Fednow Won’t Replace Cash, the U.S. Central Bank Insists
 
When the U.S. Federal Reserve announced the launch of the Fednow service in July, it sparked immediate opposition and led many to believe it is one of the initial stages of an American central bank digital currency (CBDC). Several prominent economists and politicians have cautioned that a CBDC would bring about greater surveillance of Americans’ financial transactions.

This is an opinion editorial by Milan Stanojevic, an elementary school teacher and filmmaker.
Since the end of the second world war, the United States has consistently been the dominant global superpower. The Soviet Union vied for superiority during the Cold War but ultimately failed as it lost control of its satellite states. This was evident when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. 
In recent years, American hegemony has been challenged by China, a nation which has accumulated tremendous wealth since opening up its economy to the world. China now seems poised to usurp global power as it continues to engage in a form of financial imperialism across the globe (for mor…</span>
