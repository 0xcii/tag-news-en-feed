                              <span>The saga of Ethereum ETFs in the US continues with a new twist: cautious optimism. After the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s unexpected green light for spot Ethereum ETFs in May, investors have been eagerly awaiting the launch date. But according to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, patience remains key.
 
 
Gensler Throws Cold Water On Rapid Launch Hopes
 
In a recent interview with CNBC, Gensler tempered expectations, stating that final approvals for individual ETFs “will likely take some time.”
 
This suggests that the review process will likely take a long time, which could postpone the establishment of Ethereum ETFs, according to Eleanor Terrett, a writer for Fox Business.  However, Gensler did offer a glimmer of hope, acknowledging that the process is underway.

Bitcoin Whales Have Been In Buying Mode Since Mid-March
 
According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the BTC whales have been increasing their supply since the middle of March. The “whales” here refer to the Bitcoin addresses carrying more than 1,000 BTC in their balance.
 
 
At the current exchange rate of the cryptocurrency, this amount converts to around $71.4 million, which is quite quite massive. Because of these large holdings, the whales are considered influential entities on the network.
 
As such, their collective behavior can be something to watch, given that their movements may affect the cryptocurrency’s price. There …</span>

Crypto Exchange Landscape And Institutional Interest
 
According to CCData reports, this deceleration affects both spot and derivatives markets. Spot trading diminished by 21.6% to reach $1.57 trillion. The decline was slightly less steep at 19.4% on the derivatives front, totaling $3.69 trillion.

Lawyers representing BSV Claims, the entity pursuing the case, contend that the delisting caused a significant drop in BSV’s value and hindered its potential to become a “top tier” cryptocurrency, leading to a claim valued at up to £9…</span>

                              <span>In a notable announcement, Turkey’s Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has clarified that the government does not plan to impose taxes on profits derived from “stocks and cryptocurrencies.”
