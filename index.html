The burn rate saw a significant decline between Thursday and Friday after the number of burn transactions fell. Over the 24-hour period, there was a total of 14.37 SHIB burned, which translates to a 28.05% decline from the prior day’s figures, according to data from the Shiba Inu burn tracking website, Shibburn.

BREAKING: 🇧🇹 Kingdom of Bhutan to increase mining capacity 6x ahead of the #Bitcoin halving to 600 megawatts.
Nation state FOMO is setting in 🙌 pic.twitter.com/kLsU3fGk0U
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 5, 2024
  
  
  
According to Bloomberg, Bhutan&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund Druk Holding &amp; Investments is partnering with Bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer to ramp up capacity from 100 to 600 megawatts. The country has taken an institutional interest in Bitcoin, with its sovereign fund purchasing BTC since prices were around $5,000.
Bhutan announced last year it was raising $500 million to boost mining operations. By framing mining as both a commercial opportunity and crisis mitigation tool, Bhutan has embraced Bitcoin more fully than most nations. Its renewable hydropower reserves also make it an ideal location for eco-friendly mining.
The new investment in cutting-edge mining hardware comes as the Bitcoin network faces a halving in mid-April. The quadrennial event cuts block rewards for miners in half, impacting revenue.
Bhutan cited offsetting the halving&#x27;s impact as a motivation for expanding its mining operations. Bitdeer has one of the lowest costs per Bitcoin mined in the industry at $20,000 per coin, far below the global average of up to $45,000.
The remote Himalayan nation has also viewed Bitcoin mining as a way to boost rural economies and jobs.</span>

                              <span>The Solana network has been experiencing unprecedented levels of congestion, leading to a record failure rate of transactions. According to data from Dune Analytics, on April 4, more than three-quarters of all “non-vote” transactions on Solana failed.

The issue has sparked considerable debate within the Solana community, with users voicing their frustrations over failed transactions and a deteriorating user experience on social media platforms.

Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness a $94 million outflow, although outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may decelerate. Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase&#x27;s premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin&#x27;s all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance. Solana&#x27;s (SOL) decentralized exchange (DEX) achieves a monthly volume of $50 billion, with revenue soaring 30-fold. OKX announces support for a new Solana token standard. Despite expectations, Layer 2 activity remains sluggish post-Dencun, according to Vitalik Buterin.</span>
