                              <span>In a recent development, bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has enlisted the services of US-based crypto firm Galaxy as an advisor to assist in hedging and selling its crypto holdings, as per court filings submitted on Wednesday.
 
According to a Reuters report, the filing revealed that the primary objective of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) hedging strategies is to mitigate FTX’s exposure to adverse price fluctuations before executing the sale. 
 
By implementing these measures, FTX aims to reduce its exposure to market volatility and potential losses, ultimately ensuring a more favorable environment for the eventual sale of its crypto assets.

Litecoin Triggers Death Cross After Halving Rally Failure
 
This month, the Litecoin block reward halving came and went, leading to very little upside. The disappointment is partly responsible for the depth of the recent post-halving crash. The rest is part of a broader market correction driven by Bitcoin.
 
 
The cryptocurrency has lost around 45% of its value since late June. The fallout from all the selling has taken price below two important moving averages — which have since formed a death cross on daily LTCUSD price charts.

Here’s the chart in question:
 

 
 
From the chart, it’s visible that the analyst hasn’t compared the entire cycles, but rather from the points where each of these cycles set their respective all-time highs.
 
The basis of the comparison here is the percentage change in the price. Since the phase of the cycle relevant to this chart is the post-ATH, bear market period, the percentage change is on the negative scale for each of the cycles.

                              <span>The founders of the cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash were charged Thursday with allegedly helping to launder more than $1 billion in digital currency, including funds taken by North Korean hackers.
 
Department of Justice: ‘You Can’t Hide From Us Behind a Keyboard — Whether You’re a Hacker or Facilitator’
 
Roman Storm and Roman Semenov were indicted federally on charges of conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy to violate sanctions laws, and operation of an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Storm was arrested in Washington, and Semenov remains at large.
 
Prosecutors allege that Storm and Semenov intentionally designed Tornado Cash to let cyber criminals anonymize transfers of funds on the blockchain. The system was used to launder more than $1 billion in digital currency, violating U.S. sanctions, the indictment says.
 
Earlier this spring, Tornado Cash is believed to have aided in laundering part of the $600 million stolen by hackers sponsored by North Korea in a March attack on the Ronin Network, an Ethereum sidechain. Although the company had already put sanctions screening in place, Storm and Semenov reportedly used deceptive compliance practices to keep processing illicit transactions, prosecutors said.
 
 
“As alleged, Tornado Cash was an infamous cryptocurrency mixer that laundered more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds and violated U.S. sanctions,” Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York said in a statement. “Roman Storm and Roman Semenov allegedly operated Tornado Cash and knowingly facilitated this money laundering.”
 
These charges come amid a national cryptocurrency crackdown by the Department of Justice aimed at those facilitating cybercrime and evading sanctions. This action follows last year’s imprisonment of Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev by Dutch officials.

Splicing is expected to tackle a persistent challenge within the Lightning network—liquidity constraints. These constraints have long been cited as a barrier to widespread adoption, impeding the seamless flow of transactions.
