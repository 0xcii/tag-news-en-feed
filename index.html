The most recent disputes in crypto have been sparked by the back-and-forth between Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, and some members of the XRP community. As a result, an old video has resurfaced of a journalist claiming to possess damaging information against Hoskinson. However, the Cardano founder has wasted no time in calling out the bluff.

The Financial Times reported that during the cross-examination,  
prosecutors presented SBF with tweets, media interviews, and sworn testimony,  
which he claimed were unrelated to the operations of the defunct crypto

Bank of Spain Report Evidences Cash Preference
A recent report of the Bank of Spain has revealed the low preference that an upcoming digital euro, the proposed European central bank digital currency (CBDC), would have compared to other payment alternatives.

Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Has Seen Four Consecutive Positive Changes Now
 
The “mining difficulty” is a feature on the Bitcoin blockchain that controls how hard the miners would find it to hash blocks on the network right now. The metric is measured in terms of how many hashes the miners would need to generate before they can solve the block.
 
The reason this feature exists at all is that the network intends to keep its block production rate (that is, the rate at which miners go through new blocks) at a constant value.
 
When the miners increase their computing power (what’s called the “hashrate“), they become faster at solving blocks. To slow th…</span>

The number of bitcoins on centralized exchanges is slightly more than 2 million. A recent report from Falconx says swings in the market have been exacerbated by a persistent lack of liquidity.
 
Crypto Exodus: Over $2 Billion in Bitcoins Pulled from Exchanges in 90 Days
 

 
The count of bitcoins on centralized exchanges has plummeted to a multi-year low, with a mere 36,000 BTC exceeding the 2 million mark. This starkly contrasts the 2.513 million BTC stashed on trading platforms as of November 5, 2022.
 

 
Within a span of under a year, exchanges saw a reduction of 477,000 BTC. Fast forward to July 31, 2023, and about 2.096 million bitcoins were held on these trading platforms. T…</span>

The true essence of a cryptocurrency lies in its reliance on cryptography, and nothing else, to secure its network. This brings us to an essential distinction: only proof-of-work coins can be genuinely considered “crypto.” This distinction is not just semantic but fundamentally important, as it underscores what exactly strengthens the ledger.

                              <span>Almost four years have elapsed since the market crash of March 11, 2020, widely known as “Black Thursday.” During that turbulent period, the value of bitcoin plummeted by more than 50% in a 24-hour span, reaching $3,867 per unit. This ominous date, etched indelibly in financial history, is synonymous with a “black swan” event, characterized by its profoundly adverse nature and the near-impossibility of prediction. The following narrative embarks on a retrospective journey through the events of that memorable day in 2020.

According to the report, USDT trading volume surpassed all cryptocurrencies combined recorded in 2022. This report reflects the increased adoption of stablecoins as a means of payment by Brazilians amid rising inflation. 
 
USDT Dominates Other Cryptocurrencies In Trading Volume
 
Notably, Stablecoins account for about 10% of the global cryptocurrency trading volume. Most people regard the class of digital assets as a haven during increased market volatility. This may be due to their fiat currency peg that makes them relatively stable than conventional crypto assets.
