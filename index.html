The plan is slated to start rolling out in the second half of 2023.
 
According to the Wall Street Journal, these major banks are reportedly preparing to launch a digital wallet that enables online shopping links with debit and credit cards to compete with the likes of PayPal and Apple Pay.
 
The banks are collaborating with money-transfer service Zelle to establish a separate digital wallet system that uses the digital wallet.

Jessica Walker at Fluid said: “One of the problems with crypto is the lack of connection to the real world. Fluid solves that by integrating Dai directly into our accounts. Users can buy Dai directly from us using dollars, euros, pounds and dozens of other currencies. Dai holders can also now buy coffee on their Fluid Cards, which operate on the Mastercard network”.
 
Fluid offers traditional bank accounts in Europe and the UK and Fluid Accounts, which are open to anyone globally. Users can connect their Web3 wallets to these accounts, for a seamless Tra…</span>

                              <span>Dogecoin is now a long way from its all-time high of $0.7 which was brought about by billionaire Elon Musk aggressively promoting what he calls his “favorite” cryptocurrency. However, as the meme coin continues to trend low, even with the current bull sentiment, there is always the possibility of Musk resuming his very public support for Dogecoin.
 
Can Elon Musk Recreate 2021 For Dogecoin?
 
Elon Musk’s influence on the Dogecoin community and the price of the meme coin by extension is still very prominent. Just the fact that Musk had purchased Twitter had sent the price of DOGE rallying over 150% in a matter of days. But so far, there has not been much from the billionaire about the cryptocurrency.
 
 
However, looking back to early 2021 when Musk had been posting religiously about Dogeco…</span>

                              <span>As investors examine the next move of the Federal Reserve, analysts, economists and market participants are also closely monitoring inflation levels. In Dec. 2022, the annual inflation rate dropped to 6.5%, and many experts predict it will decrease further. However, economist Mohamed El-Erian of the University of Cambridge believes inflation will become “sticky” in midyear, around 4%. The central bank, on the other hand, is primarily focused on reducing inflation to 2%.

                              <span>Xrp moved to a multi-month high on Jan. 23, as market optimism grew regarding a lawsuit between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following comments last week from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, many have bought the token in anticipation of the lawsuit ending in the coming months. Dogecoin was another notable gainer on Monday.
 
XRP
 
XRP, formerly ripple, was one of Monday’s notable gainers, as the token rose to a three-month high in today’s session.
 
XRP/USD hit an intraday high of $0.431 to start the week, coming off the back of Sunday’s low at $0.3979.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, XRP has risen to its strongest point since November 8.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move took place following a breakout of a ceiling at the $0.410 resistance level.
 
As of writing, XRP is still trading above this point, however earlier gains have eased, with price now at $0.420.
 
Momentum has eased, with traders seemingly securing gains as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is tracking at 68.64, nears a ceiling at 69.00.
 
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
In addition to XRP, dogecoin (DOGE) started the week stronger, with the meme coin hovering close to a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $0.0861 on Sunday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.09289 earlier today.
 
This surge saw dogecoin briefly break out of a resistance point at $0.09200, closing in on a six-week high in the process.
 
 
As can be seen on the chart, this breakout was not sustained, with the meme coin now trading below $0.09000.
 
One of the reasons behind the afternoon’s decline is the fact that price strength has encountered a hurdle of its own.
 
Currently the RSI is tracking at 63.51, which is slightly below a ceiling at the 64.00 mark, and seems to have panicked earlier bulls.

Axie Infinity is one of the projects that were pummeled to the ground. According to a July 2022 report by CheersLand, the native token of Axie Infinity, AXS, has lost 91% of its value in the third quarter of last year. 
 
But with the reinvigorated crypto sentiment in the market, AXS has seen growth since the start of the year. According to CoinGecko, the token is up 43% in the past 24 hours with the biggest gain being made in the bi-weekly time frame. 
 
Despite negative developments on-chain, this rise in price might be a sign of revival for Axie Infinity.
