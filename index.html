DCG’s objection centers around Genesis’ proposal to pay customers more than they are legally entitled to, a move that DCG believes “unfairly” favors a select group of creditors and strips DCG of valuable economic and corporate governance rights.

In an interview with Henri Arslanian, the host of the Future of Money Podcast, Clayton hinted that the Commission could appeal Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling. While commenting on how the court ruled that programmatic sales didn’t qualify as securities, he alluded to whether or not the appellate court would reach a similar conclusion upon appeal.

A Resilient Approach
Japan&#x27;s regulatory journey, shaped by the fallout from the Coincheck hack in 2018, has been marked by resilience. While other nations may have hesitated, Japan&#x27;s regulatory approach proved pivotal in safeguarding user assets during the FTX collapse in November 2022. The requirement for crypto exchanges to segregate assets showcased a robust stance, ensuring users could recover funds in a crisis.

Doge-1 Satellite Rebooking Fee Paid In Dogecoin
 
The CEO of Geometric Energy, Samuel Reid, confirmed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that they “had” to repay the rebooking fee to Elon Musk’s SpaceX in DOGE. This suggests that his company had no other choice but to use the meme coin to pay if they still intended to move on with the Doge-1 mission.

A Rare Bitcoin Buy Signals Prints
 
According to a crypto analyst on X, the ADX/DI indicator formed a bullish crossover on the monthly chart for the first time in eight years. The trend and momentum-following tool is used mainly because of its ability to identify trend strength and potential reversals. 
 
 
Sharing a chart, the analyst noted that the current formation is “eerily similar” in structure to when the same pattern was printed in 2016. Following this pattern in 2016, Bitcoin prices floated higher the next year, sparked by…</span>
