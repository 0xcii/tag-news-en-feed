have flourished, leaving investors grappling with losses that have surpassed a  
staggering USD $26 billion to date. While existing trackers focus on crypto and  
NFT heists, a new frontier has emerged: one that encompasses insider jobs,  
Ponzi schemes, and intricate scams.

recently released by Comparitech, the influx of stolen funds dwindled in 2023,  
signaling a potential reduction in cybercriminal activities. Despite this, the  
cumulative sum of stolen funds continues to rise. However, it is lower compared  
to 2022, which witnessed an unprecedented wave of crypto heists, with hackers  
pocketing over USD $3.5 billion in ill-gotten gains.

                              <span>Researchers from Glassnode and Ark Invest have collaborated to develop a new economic model for analyzing Bitcoin’s onchain metrics called “Cointime Economics.” The framework offers an alternative way to measure the economic activity and value of bitcoin based on “coinblocks” rather than the standard accounting method of unspent transaction outputs, or UTXOs.
 
Cointime Economics: A Unique Framework for Analyzing Bitcoin
 
The Cointime Economics white paper explains that coinblocks are the product of the number of bitcoin, or BTC, multiplied by the number of blocks they are held without moving. For instance, ten bitcoins held for ten blocks would equal 100 coinblocks. This method aims to capture the real economic weight and importance of each bitcoin based on the time it remains dormant.

Research Highlights East’s Rise as Challenger to West’s Gold Pricing Tradition
 
In a comprehensive exposé on Seeking Alpha, Gainesville Coins’ gold analyst Jan Nieuwenhuijs emphasizes the waning control of the West over the global gold market, attributed to the East’s robust acquisitions.
 
“The global gold landscape has witnessed a pivotal shift. During the latter part of 2022 and early 2023, the East has been pushing gold prices upwards, effectively shattering the West’s historical pricing stronghold,” the author asserts.

                              <span>Approximately 16 trillion PEPE tokens worth $15 million were illicitly transferred to crypto exchanges and sold, according to an announcement from the meme coin’s anonymous lead developer. The theft was allegedly orchestrated by three former team members who accessed the token’s multi-signature wallet before removing themselves from the project. Despite this setback, the lead developer has promised to continue moving the project forward and to fully decentralize it.

                              <span>United States President Joe Biden’s proposed cryptocurrency tax regulations are causing concern among many. These regulations would require brokers (individuals facilitating buying and selling) to report digital currency transactions to the government, aligning with existing practices for other monetary transactions. 
 
However, these rules are facing opposition within the cryptocurrency community. Critics argue that these stringent measures could stifle innovation and progress within the US.
 
 
Ryan Selkis, CEO of Messari, is a vocal opponent of this concept. He predicts unfavorable outcomes for the US cryptocurrency industry if Biden is reelected. 
 
 
There’s no future for crypto in the US if Biden is reelected. I’m sorry.
