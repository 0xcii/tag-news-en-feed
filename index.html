According to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, the decentralized computing platform Ethereum Classic (ETC) is now a scam and “its only purpose is for insiders to dump on those they recruit with blind hope of some magical future that will never come.” In his rant against ETC on Twitter, Hoskinson, himself one of the co-founders of Ethereum, also slammed what sees as the platform’s lack of a roadmap or vision.

Japan’s New Crypto Rules  

The new AML laws around crypto will put Japan’s legal frameworks around the industry in line with global standards. The new rules came following the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international financial standard-setting agency that deemed specific revised crypto-centric laws brought in December insufficient.

                              <span>A survey by the U.S. Federal Reserve shows that American household financial well-being “declined markedly” in 2022. The share of adults who said they were worse off financially than a year earlier rose to “the highest level since the question was first asked in 2014,” according to the U.S. central bank.

He&#x27;s also figuring out how to upend what it means to be a music fan. The band launched a Deathbats Club NFT collection in 2021. That is to say: They were early. The lead singer said it was timed to give fans a chance to get comfortable with Web3 technology ahead of the group&#x27;s 2023 tour, when the NFT holders can use their Deathbats for early access to tickets. M. Shadows also talked to hosts Andrew Hayward and Stephen Graves about AI and bringing Web3 into gaming.</span>
