USDC CEX Market Share Rises 2X
 
This development is noteworthy considering the depressed USDC activity in the first half of 2023 following the continuation of the crypto bear market. The recovery also follows fundamental changes in Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, that saw the platform delist USDC in their bid to concentrate liquidity and increase market share for the now-delisted BUSD.

Garlinghouse Calls SEC Chair a ‘Political Liability’
 
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse directed strong criticism towards U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler in Davos on Tuesday. Calling Gensler a “political liability” due to his approach to the crypto industry, Garlinghouse said:

Garlinghouse’s remarks, which labeled Gensler as a “political liability,” reflect growing frustration within the crypto industry regarding the SEC’s “track record” towards regulation.
 
Garlinghouse Challenges Gensler Over Crypto Oversight
