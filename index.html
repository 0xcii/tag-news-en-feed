                              <span>May 20 is an important day in the long-running legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple. The Commission is expected to file a response to the crypto firm’s motion, which seeks to protect the company’s business interests. 
 
SEC To File Opposition To Ripple’s Sealing Requests
 
A court filing shows that the Commission must file its letter brief in opposition to Ripple’s motion to seal by May 20. Ripple had filed the motion on May 13 in line with the scheduling order, which stipulated that date as the deadline for both parties to file a motion to seal any document related to the remedies stage.

                              <span>A UK judge has ruled that Craig Wright, who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, lied extensively and forged documents during a high-profile trial.
In a scathing 231-page judgment, Justice James Mellor stated that Wright &quot;lied to the court repeatedly&quot; and committed forgery &quot;on a grand scale&quot; in a failed attempt to prove he was Nakamoto. 
A group of crypto firms brought the civil trial, the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), that sought to prevent Wright from claiming he invented Bitcoin.

BREAKING: 🇬🇧 Judge has just published his ruling in the COPA vs Craig Wright lawsuit that Craig is not Satoshi Nakamoto.
