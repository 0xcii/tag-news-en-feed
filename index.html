SEC Extends ETF Review To 2024
 
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its approval for Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum Futures ETF applications. The regulator filed for an extension on November 15 stating that it needed more time to properly review the issues of the application and its decision regarding ETFs. 
 
 
“The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and issues raised therein,” the SEC stated in the filing.

                              <span>On Wednesday, crypto analyst Chris Blec highlighted that Bitcoin’s two major mining pools now control over half of the network’s total hashrate. Blec posits this dominance could transform bitcoin mining into an industry adhering to regulatory standards, with all miners required to follow Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines.
 
Control Over Bitcoin’s Hashrate Is a Nuanced Topic
 
Currently, Antpool leads with a 30% share of Bitcoin’s total hashrate, closely followed by Foundry USA, which holds 26%. Together, these pools exert a 56% influence over the network’s 468 exahash per second (EH/s) hashrate. Chris Blec, a noted figure in the crypto research community, voiced his concerns on the social media platform X this Wednesday.

“This includes ensuring the legal security for companies and citizens...We need to combat potential risks such as money laundering, tax evasion and other illegal activities associated with Bitcoin. But without stifling innovation and the freedom aspects of Bitcoin,” she said.

Tether Whale Transactions And Volume Are At High Values Right Now
 
As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the number one stablecoin in the sector, USDT, has seen a large spike in activity recently. There are two metrics of interest here: trading volume and whale transaction count.
 
The former of these keeps track of the total amount of USDT that’s getting involved in trades on spot exchanges daily. The metric’s value basically tells us about how active the market participants are right now.
 
 
The other relevant indicator here, the whale transaction count, measures the number of transfers happening on the network that carry a value of …</span>

                              <span>BlackRock has filed a prospectus with the US  
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot ether exchange-traded fund  
(ETF). The filing followed the registration of the name of the new offering and  
the application for the filing of an application by Nasdaq seeking approval of  
the spot ETF.
According to a report by Coindesk, the price of Ether (ETH) surged 2% to $2,080 following the filing of the S-1 form by the  
asset management giant. This reaction underscored the market&#x27;s heightened  
sensitivity to ETF-related updates, echoing the recent trend where court  
rulings against SEC rejections of spot crypto ETF applications have kindled  
optimism for future approvals.

First things first, the primary function of Bitcoin is to remove the State’s special privilege of debt pardoning through monetary printing. Bitcoin is rules without rulers; a cypherpunk technology that empowers the individual with verifiable financial independence. A peer-to-peer bitcoin transaction is speech. The right to run a node, enforce consensus, and validate economic activity with impeccable fidelity to genesis should be upheld and supported by any person, even if not seeking public office in the most influential regulatory regime on the planet.
