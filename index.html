                              <span>Over the  
last few months, investor sentiment towards individual cryptocurrencies has  
favored Ethereum (ETH) over Bitcoin (BTC). However, the release of the  
first-ever spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for BTC has changed the balance of  
market forces, and now there is a much more bullish positioning towards the  
oldest cryptocurrency. This is especially true as its price has reached the  
highest levels in two years, exceeding $50,000.
Europeans Show Greater  
Interest in Bitcoin over Ethereum
Spectrum  
Markets, a pan-European trading venue, released data showing diverging

                              <span>In a recent video titled “Legacy is Eating Crypto,” Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has expressed concerns about the increasing centralization of power in the cryptocurrency industry. Hoskinson specifically highlighted the dominance of a few top companies in the Bitcoin and stablecoin sectors, arguing that this poses risks to users and undermines the decentralized nature of crypto.
 
 
Centralization Of Stablecoins
 
Hoskinson pointed out that asset-backed stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), control a significant portion of the stablecoin market. He noted that USDT and USDC alone account for 70% of on-chain volume while representing only 10% of the entire crypto industry.

                              <span>Crypto gaming platform PlayDapp has been the victim of a series of breaches, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars worth of PLA tokens. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has reported that the breaches have led to the theft of PLA tokens valued at $290 million, based on their market value at the time of the incidents. 
 
Security Crisis At PlayDapp
 
According to Elliptic, on February 9, an unauthorized wallet managed to “mint” 200 million PLA tokens, worth approximately $36.5 million. This breach was believed to result from a compromise of a private key. 
 
 
In an attempt to recover the stolen funds, PlayDapp sent a message to the exploiter through an on-chain transaction, offering a $1 million “white hat reward” if the stolen funds were returned by February 13. The message reads:…</span>

In a recent CNBC interview, Tom Lee, a key figure in the financial analytics sector, shed light on the driving forces behind BTC’s notable surge to this significant high.
 
 
Key Factor Behind $50,000 BTC Surge
 
Tom Lee has identified the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a crucial driver behind this upward trajectory. Introducing these spot ETFs in the US represents a “watershed moment,” bridging the gap between traditional investment mechanisms and the digital currency domain.
