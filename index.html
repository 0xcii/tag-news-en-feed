                              <span>Among the meme coins making waves recently, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has stood out, attracting significant interest from holders of other popular meme coins like Floki (FLOKI) and PlayDoge (PLAY). But what is driving this trend? Here are the top three reasons why FLOKI and PlayDoge investors are adding Mpeppe to their portfolios.
 
 
 
Mpeppe’s Explosive Presale Growth 
 
 
One of the primary reasons FLOKI and PlayDoge investors are turning their attention to Mpeppe is its explosive growth potential. Mpeppe, a relatively new entrant in the meme coin market, has already shown remarkable momentum during its presale phase. The coin has been gaining traction quickly, with its community expanding at an impressive rate. This rapid adoption suggests that Mpeppe could follow in the footsteps of its predeces…</span>

                              <span>Zürcher Kantonalbank (ZKB), Switzerland&#x27;s fourth-largest bank, has begun offering its clients Bitcoin and crypto trading and custody services. With over $290 billion in assets under management, ZKB provides services to retail, corporate, and institutional clients.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 4, 2024
  
  
  
ZKB now allows clients to trade and hold Bitcoin and crypto through its mobile app, online banking, and traditional channels. The bank partnered with Deutsche Börse-owned Crypto Finance AG for brokerage services and developed its own custody solution.
The move reflects the country&#x27;s openness to Bitcoin, and cements ZKB as one of the largest mainstream financial institutions to embrace Bitcoin. Switzerland has taken a relatively positive stance on Bitcoin and crypto, including the Swiss National Bank, revealing it held shares in MicroStrategy.
The launch comes as more major financial players adopt Bitcoin and crypto offerings amid Bitcoin&#x27;s surge in legitimacy. In the U.S., the successful debut of Bitcoin ETFs has accelerated institutional adoption. ZKB&#x27;s move may pressure other Swiss and European banks to provide Bitcoin services.
Banks worldwide, such as Hong Kong&#x27;s Futu and Standard Chartered&#x27;s Mox, have also recently launched Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs trading. This growing trend shows that traditional finance is increasingly embracing Bitcoin.</span>

Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index Is Currently Sitting Deep Inside ‘Fear’
 
The “Fear &amp; Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors of Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies.

When the indicator has a value greater than 53, the traders share a sentiment of greed. On the other hand, it being under 47 implies the presence of fear in the market. Naturally, the region between the t…</span>
