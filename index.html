Last week, I put the massive buying pressure coming to bitcoin in context, but there is another — perhaps the largest — source of potential demand entering the scene. 
We already know the Bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy issuing more shares to buy more bitcoin, Tether’s constant buying, and the halving will all be major sources of demand this cycle. For example, in the first two weeks of trading alone, the “newborn 9” accumulated 125,000 BTC. That has, so far, been offset by GBTC outflows, but it is unlik…</span>

Speaking with Digital Perspectives, Jones elaborated on her predictions about the company’s future, particularly focusing on its pre-IPO share value.
 
Pre-IPO Shares Have The Potential For A 2000% Rise
 
She began her analysis by referencing the current valuation of pre-IPO shares on Linqto, a platform for private investing. “According to Linqto, at $35 a share, which is slightly under $34 today on the Linqto website, that is a $5.7 billion valuation for Ripple stock,” Jones stated. This figure, she noted, is notably lower than the enterprise’s past buyback at a valuation of $15 billion.
