                              <span>Asset management giant BlackRock has extended its  
Ethereum ETF to Brazil. As of August 28, Brazilian investors can now trade the  
iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) via a Brazilian Depositary Receipt (BDR) on the  
B3 stock exchange under the ticker ETHA39, local media publication InfoMoney reported. 
Ethereum ETF in Brazil 
This move followed BlackRock’s earlier success with  
its Bitcoin ETF in the region. The introduction of ETHA39 reportedly marks a  
significant milestone for Brazilian investors seeking exposure to Ethereum, the  
second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. 
The ETF, which originally launched in the United  
States in June 2024, is now available in Brazil at a price of approximately  
one-third of the original asset’s value, thanks to the BDR structure. This…</span>

Lightspark Extend integrates with Universal Money Addresses (UMA) and Lightning-enabled wallets, exchanges, or bank accounts, providing a compliant and cost-effective solution for 24/7 payments. Compatible with over 99% of U.S. banks that accept real-time payments, the platform allows businesses to offer their customers fast, low-cost transactions directly to eligible recipients.
UMA, available in 120 countries, simplifies sending value by using a human-friendly address similar to an email, eliminating the need to remember complex codes or passwords. Lightspark Extend launching now makes this capability is accessible in the U.S., enabling recipients with real-time payments-enabled accounts to receive UMA-powered payments via the Bitcoin Lightning Network.
Lightspark further stated in the announcement that businesses interested in adopting Lightspark Extend can sign up for a UMA address, link eligible accounts, and start receiving payments through an onboarding process facilitated by Zero Hash, a regulated U.S. financial institution.
The launch of Lightspark Extend signifies yet another step forward in making instant, low-cost Bitcoin payments more accessible to businesses and consumers across the U.S., expanding the reach and utility of the Bitcoin Lightning Network.
Just last week, Lightspark announced that Coinbase customers can now send Bitcoin transactions up to $10,000 instantly through the Lightning Network, thanks to their partnership.</span>

If, in 2021, the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery, so too does the two-year period from 2008 to 2010 when Bitcoin’s creator served as the project’s principal developer and leader. 
Yet, far from a lifeless period of project development, during those years Nakamoto worked with dozens if not hundreds of Bitcoin users, all of whom contributed to the effort in different ways, establishing websites, engaging in commerce and evangelizing for his invention. 
Still, some users naturally emerged as more distinguished contributors. 
Whether it was by helping establish core elements of the Bitcoin philosophy or articulating its value propositions in new and novel ways, a meritocracy develope…</span>

                              <span>The crypto market experienced a notable pullback yesterday, with many assets retreating to lower levels. Avalanche (AVAX) suffered a 15% decline from its recent local top of $28.01.
 
 
This retracement has caught the attention of analysts and investors, who now view it as a strategic entry point for the asset. AVAX is currently testing a key support level that, if respected, could pave the way for further gains. Analysts suggest that this level is crucial for maintaining the uptrend and potentially leading to more upside for the Layer-1 blockchain. 
 
If the support holds, it could signal a bullish continuation, with the price possibly retesting previous highs and moving beyond. However, the asset may see further declines or sideways movement if the support fails. The coming days will be …</span>
