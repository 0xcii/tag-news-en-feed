                              <span>On-chain data shows that Bitcoin long-term holders have notably increased their supply this year. Here are the exact numbers.
 
Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Grown Throughout 2023
 
In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how the supplies of Bitcoin long-term holders and short-term holders have changed over the year 2023.
 
These two investor groups make up the two main divisions of the BTC sector. The short-term holders (STHs) are the participants who bought within the last 155 days, while the long-term holders (LTHs) are those who have held longer than that.

Norway, a pioneer in CBDC research, recently disclosed the outcomes of

an immediate need for a retail CBDC, the focus shifts to a wholesale CBDC for  
interbank settlement of tokenized deposits. The fifth phase, set to conclude in
