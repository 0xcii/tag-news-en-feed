                              <span>A Shiba Inu (SHIB) recovery is on the horizon, as recent on-chain data shows that the meme coin’s investors may have cooled off on offloading their tokens. This has reflected positively on Shiba Inu’s price, which is up in the last 24 hours. 
 
Shiba Inu’s Net Flows To Exchanges On The Decline
 
Data from the on-chain data analytics platform CryptoQuant shows that SHIB’s net flow into exchanges has declined. This undoubtedly presents a relief for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, considering that the meme coin had faced intense selling pressure following the movement of a significant amount of SHIB into exchanges. 
 
 
Bitcoinist reported a recent decrease in the number of Shiba Inu held by whales, with 392.7 billion tokens being moved from their wallets. This suggested that they had moved their ho…</span>

Bitcoin Needs To Grow Its Adoption This Much To Challenge The USD
 
In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed what the expectation around the original cryptocurrency has been building up to in financial circles recently.
 
“The financial world now believes Bitcoin is a fast emerging asset class,” says Woo. At present, though, the coin only has a total market cap of around $1.2 trillion, while the analyst notes that asset classes are generally valued in “units of tens of trillion.”

Bitcoin And Ethereum Put-Call Ratio Falling
 
Even so, there appear to be changes. According to Kaiko, a crypto analytics platform, traders are upbeat about what lies ahead. The put-to-call ratio for both Bitcoin and Ethereum declined in June after the brief increase in May. 
 
Technically, the put-call ratio is a crucial metric used to gauge market sentiment. To calculate it, analysts divide the total trading volume of put options by that of call options.
