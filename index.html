                              <span>Bitcoin mining is a controversial subject of debate due to its significant energy consumption. While proponents argue that it offers various climate benefits and can contribute to grid stability, mitigate methane emissions and expand renewable energy resources, MIT researchers have put this thesis to the test.
 
In a recent study by Christian Stoll, Lena Klaaßen, Ulrich Gallersdörfer, and Alexander Neumülle, the researchers validate the arguments from both sides and shed light on the extent and energy sources of Bitcoin mining in the United States.
 
Satoshi Act co-founder and CEO Dennis Porter wrote via Twitter, “BREAKING: MIT researchers acknowledge the grid balancing, methane mitigating benefits of Bitcoin mining in a new paper.” He emphasized this huge milestone, adding that “the paper…</span>

Many supporters and market observers anticipate a price increase prior to the event. According to an anonymous market analyst known as Plan B, bitcoin’s price could ascend to between $40,000 and $50,000 in the run-up to the next block reward halving.
 
Plan B Estimates Bitcoin Could Cross $40K Ahead of Fourth Halving Amidst Market Uncertainties
 
Two optimistic events are stirring discussion in recent circles: the potential approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., and the impending block reward halving. The forthcoming halving, predicted to occur in about nine months, near April 24, 2024, will inevitably halve bitcoin miners’ revenues. Analysts at JPMo…</span>

The initial intention was for the partnership between Binance’s Argentina division and the Argentine Football Association to span five years. However, the agreement came to an end after only one year with the crypto exchange attributing the termination to the Argentine Football Association’s (AFA)  failure to meet contractual obligations, citing non-compliance as the primary reason.
