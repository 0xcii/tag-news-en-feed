                              <span>Worldcoin, the iris biometric crypto project, has reportedly reached an agreement with Kenyan authorities which allows it to resume operations in the African country. Worldcoin representatives are said to be “working directly with regulators to meet Kenya’s requirements.”
 
Worldcoin to Restart Kenyan Iris Scanning in Early 2024
 
According to a report, Worldcoin representatives may have reached an agreement with Kenyan authorities which allows the iris biometric cryptocurrency project to resume operations under new guidelines. The report, which cites unnamed sources, said this is likely to happen sometime in early 2024.
 
The claim that Worldcoin is set to resume distributing its WLD tokens to users who agree to have their eyeballs scanned comes just a few months after Kenyan authorities suspended such activities. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, Kenyan regulators were adamant that Worldcoin did not have the necessary license to carry out its activities in the East African country.
 
 
Following the suspension, Worldcoin representatives visited Kenya where they made an appearance before the country’s legislative body. However, according to a Citizen Digital report, Worldcoin may have satisfied concerns initially raised by regulators.
 
“Worldcoin is working directly with regulators to meet Kenya’s requirements, particularly as the Assembly considers new regulations. Stipends will remain and will expand to locations across the country,” the unnamed source reportedly said.
 
The report, however, did not reveal when the Kenyan parliament is expected to pass new data regulations which will guide entities like Worldcoin.

It is, however, worth mentioning that there has been a substantial increase in BTC’s price since May 8, which could explain the rise in the dollar value. Miners receive these fees to inscribe digital assets (Ordinals) on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals are casua…</span>

                              <span>Over the last ten years, Luke Dashjr has emerged as a key player in the realm of Bitcoin development and the network’s open-source software. His opposition to specific trends within the Bitcoin ecosystem has gained more attention lately. He has labeled Ordinal inscriptions and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin platform as detrimental to the protocol and akin to spam, which he believes has been curtailed since 2014. Just this week, he suggested that Antpool might be employing “covert” ASIC Boost techniques. Subsequently, he informed individuals that the Bitcoin community has the power to fire all miners “by changing to a different PoW algorithm.”

                              <span>In the wake of a substantial increase in onchain transaction fees for Bitcoin, the compensation to bitcoin miners from inscription-based transfers has hit a record peak in the last 24 hours. An estimated total of $9.97 million was allocated to miners, eclipsing the former high of $7.21 million established on May 8, 2023. 
 
Miners Rake in Record Fees From Ordinals; Inscriptions Fuel 61% of Bitcoin Transactions
 

 
Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions are nearing the significant milestone of 50 million, with around 48,754,694 marked on the blockchain at this moment. As of Dec. 16, 2023, a record-breaking amount was remunerated to miners for Ordinal inscriptions in a single day. Data indicates that on this Saturday, miners received over 235 BTC, marking it the third-highest day in terms of BTC volume, according to Dune Analytics metrics.
 

 

 

 
Yet, this day stood out as the most substantial in the U.S. dollar value of these fees, with miners earning $9.97 million in the 24-hour timeframe. This surpasses the prior peak on May 8, 2023, when miners were compensated $7.21 million for inscription confirmations. On that particular day, miners were rewarded with more than 257 BTC for verifying inscriptions. The higher miner earnings on this recent Saturday can be attributed to the increased value of BTC.
 

 

 

 
On May 8, 2023, BTC’s closing price was at $27,668 per unit, whereas on Dec. 17, its 24-hour price fluctuated between $41,668 and $42,666. From the 48.75 million inscriptions created since Dec. 16, 2022, miners have garnered over 4,084 BTC, equivalent to $170.68 million, for confirming these transactions. On that same day, bitcoin miners processed 638,144 transactions, with 392,574 being inscription-related. This indicates that inscriptions drove 61.51% of all BTC transactions that day.
