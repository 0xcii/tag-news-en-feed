More Swapping Happening On Base And Optimism
 
Optimism and Base, two widely used layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, offer distinct advantages for traders. When swapping tokens on Uniswap, which is deployed on either of these platforms, traders benefit from considerably lower transaction fees.
 
 
Uniswap Labs reports a notable surge in swappers on Optimism and Base. Over the past year, the number has doubled from 124,970 in February 2023 to 310,050 in February 2024, indicating a rising interest in these layer-2 solutions.
