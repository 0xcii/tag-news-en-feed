On Friday, September 22, the prominent blockchain data analytics company Nansen revealed via a post on X (formerly Twitter) that one of its third-party vendors suffered a security breach, which affected 6.8% of its users. According to the crypto intelligence firm, this attack allowed the hackers to access admin rights to “an account used to provision customer access to its platform.”

This development comes as the American crypto trading platform continues to actively expand its footprint outside of the United States. 
 
 
Coinbase Enters The Spanish Market
 
According to a blog post on September 22, Coinbase explains  that its expansion into the Spanish market is part of Phase II of its international expansion strategy titled “Go Broad, Go Deep.”In particular, Coinbase secured an anti-money laundering (AML) license with the Spanish apex bank.

                              <span>Altcoins may be in for a tough year. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has raised concerns about the performance of altcoins for the remainder of 2023, citing historical patterns as a basis for his predictions. 
 
In a recent YouTube session, Cowen expressed his belief that altcoins are likely to struggle in the coming months, echoing a common trend observed in pre-halving years.
 
Cowen’s outlook is tied to the impending Bitcoin (BTC) halving, scheduled for April 2024. The term “halving” refers to an event within the Bitcoin network when miner rewards are reduced by half. 
 
 
The Halving Effect And Its Implications
 
Halving events usually occur approximately every four years and have significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. The reduction in miner rewards can lead to decreased…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin started the weekend in consolidation, as traders seemingly found a new price floor at $26,500. The price uncertainty comes as markets settled following a volatile week, which was headlined by the Federal Reserve rate decision. Ethereum remains below $1,600.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin consolidated for a second straight session, with the cryptocurrency hovering around a floor at $26,500.
 
Following a high of $26,786.10 on Friday, BTC/USD slipped to a low of $26,389.30 earlier in the session.
 
The price of bitcoin has since rebounded, and at the time of writing this is trading at the $26,581.84 level.
 
 
It appears that the rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to break out of its own floor at 50.00.
 
At the time of writing this, price strength is tracking at 50.01, and should this hold, bulls could be tempted to reenter the market.
 
Moving averages continue to signal that there could be an incoming uptrend, with the 10-day (red) trend line still higher.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) remained under the $1,600 on Saturday, despite attempts by bulls to reenter this region.
 
ETH/USD dropped to a low of $1,587.43 to start the weekend, hours after bulls pushed price to an high of $1,599.97.
 
However, it appears that there could be another attempt to move past this level, with ethereum currently trading at $1,593.07.
 
 
Unlike bitcoin, an upwards crossover of moving averages has yet to occur, however it seems like this could happen at any point.
 
This could ultimately be the signal bulls need to amplify pressure, and potentially engulf current sellers.

Building Everything From Scratch
 
However, in written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, La Rose revealed that the EOS community had to build everything from scratch since it didn’t “own any of the existing intellectual property.” In addition, La Rose said capital had to be injected” as quickly and effectively as possible” since the ecosystem had been starved of capital for years. This, however, had to be done before processes and frameworks that drive the decision-making were in place.

In the relatively short time of its existence, the decentralized social media app has been through ups and downs. From averaging trading fees rivaling top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Tron, to being labeled dead just a few weeks after launch, to making a tremendous comeback to a new all-time high in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), it has definitely been an eventful period for Friend.tech. 
 
A recently released report by AMLBot, a platform that helps users check crypto wallets for illicit funds, has dived into the ins and outs of Friend.tech to explore whether the decentralized social media app is an investment opportunity to consider.

                              <span>Growing client demand for cryptocurrencies and the belief that they represent a new asset class help to explain traditional financial institutions’ newfound interest in digital assets, the chief strategy officer at Bitrue has said. The collapse of FTX and Terra Luna in 2022 and the resulting bear market may have helped to remove barriers to entry. The entrance and presence of “tradfi” (traditional finance) institutions in the crypto market will also likely lead to the “establishment of industry standards,” according to the executive.

Bankman-Fried had sought to call seven experts on topics related to cryptocurrency markets and English contracts in an effort to convince the jury to acquit him of charges of stealing billions of dollars in FTX customer funds to cover losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund.
 
US District Judge Lewis Kaplan issued a written order that excluded three of the proposed expert witnesses, deeming their testimony either irrelevant or potentially confusing for the jury.

                              <span>Coinshares, a European digital asset manager, is moving into the U.S. with a new hedge fund division aimed at institutional investors. The firm, based in Saint Helier, Jersey, intends to offer comprehensive services for institutions exploring crypto assets.
 
Coinshares Expands to U.S. With New Hedge Fund Division
 
The company revealed its new branch, Coinshares Hedge Fund Solutions, signifying its foundational emphasis as a crypto-centric hedge fund manager. Lewis Fellas, an asset manager with more than two decades of experience, including seven years in the digital assets sector, will lead this division.
 

 
The press release highlights the merger of Coinshares‘ ten years in crypto with the expertise the team has developed from proprietary trading since 2016. The firm holds that this experience equips it to produce competitive products comparable to those of mainstream financial entities.
 
“In a changing macro environment prominently marked by interest rates and inflation, the demand for actively managed exposure to digital assets is a natural progression,” remarked Coinshares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti.
 
Mognetti added:
 

The new division signifies the latest step in Coinshares’ evolution.
 
 
Registered as a broker-dealer with FINRA, Coinshares will introduce the hedge fund offerings to eligible U.S. investors. The company noted in its release, “The long-awaited return of interest rate-driven volatility is a great opportunity that we plan to capture with our novel fund products.”
 
“Each product that will be offered is designed to mitigate counterparty risk whilst providing investors with clearly defined asset class and strategy exposures,” Fellas concluded.
