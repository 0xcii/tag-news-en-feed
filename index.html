                              <span>Elon Musk has joined forces with a legion of top-notch Artificial Intelligence (AI) visionaries to send out a chilling warning to the world. They are ringing the alarm bells and demanding an immediate halt to the breakneck pace of AI development.
 
The reason behind their call to action? The ominous and harrowing risks that AI poses to society and humanity are too grave to ignore.
 
But are these concerns warranted, or is this just another case of fear-mongering? Is it possible to strike a balance between innovation and safety, or are we playing with fire by unleashing AI without proper regulation and oversight?

Developing Chatbots More Worthwhile Than Crypto Mining, Nvidia Exec Claims
 
Cryptocurrencies do not “bring anything useful for society,” according to a high-ranking representative of Nvidia, the leading manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs). The executive expressed this opinion despite his company selling quantities of video cards to the industry.
 
Other uses of their processing power, such as those associated with artificial intelligence (AI) applications like the Chatgpt chatbot, are more…</span>

                              <span>EU lawmakers have voted in favor of imposing a €1,000 limit on crypto transactions where the customer cannot be identified. “Entities, such as banks, assets and crypto assets managers, real and virtual estate agents, and high-level professional football clubs, will be required to verify their customers’ identity, what they own and who controls the company,” the European Parliament emphasized.
 
Lawmakers Vote on New EU Regulation
 
On Tuesday, members of the European Parliament (MEP) from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (ECON) and the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee (LIBE) adopted their position on three pieces of draft legislation on the financing provisions of EU Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) policy.

                              <span>The world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, does not see the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this year. “That’s the old playbook when central banks would rush to rescue the economy as recession hit. Now they’re causing the recession to fight sticky inflation – and that makes rate cuts unlikely, in our view,” said the firm’s strategists.
 
Blackrock’s Interest Rate Prediction
 
Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager, published weekly commentary Monday explaining the state of the U.S. economy and why it does not see the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this year.
 
While noting that “Markets have been quick to price in rate cuts as a result of the banking sector turmoil and the Fed signaling a coming pause,” Blackrock’s strategists wrote:

As per the same report, the legislation concerning CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) could be approved by the Russian State Duma in the upcoming month and is expected to come into effect by May. This trial period for the digital ruble in Russia is planned to include 13 banks.
 
 
The report also suggested that some employees of the participating banks and one of the largest insurance companies in Russia, Ingosstrakh, are set to become test participants for CBDC retail payments. They will be involved in the trial of the digital ruble.

                              <span>Gnosis first launched in 2015 as a decentralized prediction market built on Ethereum. Now it&#x27;s a DAO, a multi-sig wallet, a staking chain, and a vibrant community with its own GNO governance token. Co-founder and COO Friederike Ernst talked to Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott about the careful evolution of Gnosis, decentralization impostors, account abstraction, DeFi UX failures, why Ethereum is the &quot;Manhattan of crypto,&quot; and much more.

                              <span>Neal Stephenson coined the term “metaverse” in his seminal 1992 sci-fi hit novel “Snow Crash.” Now he’s helming a metaverse blockchain company called Lamina1 and advocating for one free and open metaverse. He spoke to Dan Roberts and Stephen Graves at length about what he got right and wrong in “Snow Crash,” goggles and flat screens, Big Tech, NFTs and digital ownership, and more.
