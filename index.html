Polygon Whale Moves More Than $5 Million In MATIC To Coinbase
 
As per data from the crypto transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a sizeable amount of MATIC has moved on the Ethereum blockchain in the past day.
 
The transfer involved the movement of around 5.5 million MATIC, worth around $5.1 million at the time the transaction was made.
 
Usually, such large transfers belong to either a single whale, or an entity made up of multiple large investors.
 
Movements from these holders can have noticeable impacts on the market, depending on why they made the transfer.

                              <span>The news outlet has confirmed that The Block’s CEO received undisclosed funding from Sam Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund.
Cryptocurrency news outlet The Block’s CEO has stepped down following revelations of undisclosed loans from disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund, Alameda Research. 
Per a report by Axios, nobody else at the company was aware of these loans, made to LLCs under control by the company’s CEO, Michael McCaffrey. 
The LLC’s owned by McCaffrey received three separate loans from Alameda, with the first being used to finance the $12 million April 2021 purchase of The Block under the LLC MJMCCAFFREY.
A second $15 million loan in January of 2022 provided funding for The Block via an LLC named Lonely Road. A third loan of $16 million, according to the report, “went to an LLC named Red Sea that McCaffrey used, in part, to buy [a] Bahamas apartment.”
The Block’s Chief Revenue Officer Bobby Moran will take over as CEO, and the company will seek to restructure in order to buy out McCaffrey’s stake in the company. 
The report described how the “news came as a shock to The Block&#x27;s editorial leadership, who sources say are livid about McCaffrey&#x27;s failure to disclose such a close and critical financial partnership with Bankman-Fried and Alameda…” 
Larry Cermak, The Block’s VP of research, stated that &quot;Mike never asked me or anyone in research to cover FTX or SBF in any particular way. Or anyone else, for that matter. We had complete discretion to do our jobs.” 
Frank Chaparro, The Block’s news director, released this statement on twitter:</span>

Ethereum Devs Aim for Hard Fork Target ‘Around March-ish’
 
On Dec. 8, 2022, Ethereum Core developers convened for the 151st developers meeting, and a number of subjects were discussed including Ethereum’s next hard fork. Ethereum’s last major hard fork was The Merge, a significant change to the rules of the blockchain network which made the network change from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).

                              <span>Polygon was a notable gainer on Friday, as cryptocurrencies moved higher following a turbulent week of trading. The global crypto market cap is 2.28% higher as of writing, as markets prepared for the release of U.S. consumer sentiment data. Quant was another big mover, as prices surged for a second straight day.
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was a notable mover on Friday, as the token surged to its highest point since Monday.
 
Following a low of $0.9062 on Thursday, MATIC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.9324 earlier today.
 
As a result of this, the token moved closer to a key resistance level of $0.9540, which was last hit December 4.
 
 
Whilst prices near a ceiling, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has also moved towards its own point of support at 53.00.
 
The 10-day (red) moving average is also trending higher, with it remaining above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Despite recent turbulence, this is a sign of bullish momentum in the market, with some expecting further surges in price this weekend
 
 
Quant (QNT)
 
Quant (QNT) was another token to surge on Friday, with prices rising for a second straight session.
 
QNT/USD moved to a high of $124.88 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after hitting a bottom at $120.70.
 
Today’s move sent QNT past a recent resistance point at $122.00, with bulls now appearing to take price to a higher ceiling.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this point of resistance seems to be the $132.00 mark, which is where quant started the week.
 
In order to recapture this mark, QNT bulls will first need to overcome the upcoming resistance on the RSI of 52.00.
