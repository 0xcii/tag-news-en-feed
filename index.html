Aptos Hits $20 Ceiling, Slides 20% Lower From All-Time High
 
Aptos, a layer one (L1) blockchain created by two developers from the former Diem cryptocurrency project at Meta, saw significant growth against the U.S. dollar last month. Six days ago, it reached an all-time high of $19.92 per unit. However, in the past 24 hours, APT has lost 8.3% in value and traded between $15.89 and $17.48 per coin.

                              <span>The United Kingdom has released its first consultation on crypto trading and lending regulation within the country.
The United Kingdom has released its plans to regulate the cryptocurrency industry within the country.
The announcement highlights that “high levels of volatility and a number of recent failures have exposed the structural vulnerability of some business models in the sector,” amongst other reasons, have led to the new set of regulatory guidelines.
Specifically focusing on trading and lending, the report describes how the United Kingdom’s government “will seek to regulate a broad suite of cryptoasset activities, consistent with its approach to traditional finance.” It details how proposals will place responsibility on the cryptocurrency exchanges and firms to define detailed content requirements for disclosure documents, ensuring “fair” standards. In order to ensure the safety of customer funds, the consultation will seek to create a framework with clear guidelines for responsible practices.
“We remain steadfast in our commitment to grow the economy and enable technological change and innovation – and this includes cryptoasset technology,” Economic Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Griffith remarked.
The consultation also highlighted the necessity for cryptocurrency custodial actors and intermediaries to responsibly facilitate transactions and safely store customer assets. This is especially important in light of recent events throughout the cryptocurrency space that have left millions of customers without access to their funds. 
Today’s consultation will conclude on April 30, 2023, after which the government will consider feedback and create a response. “Once legislation is laid, the Financial Conduct Authority will consult on its detailed rules for the sector,” states the announcement.</span>

The growing innovations in the Web3 space and the Metaverse attracted several participants to crave NFT collectibles. This growing interest can be backed by Juniper Research, showing that the Metaverse will drive more NFT growth.

                              <span>Pick n Pay has partnered with CryptoQR in order to accept bitcoin at more than 2,000 stores.
Pick n Pay, a South African retailer, has launched acceptance of bitcoin for payments throughout all of their stores. Previously, a test pilot had rolled out to 39 stores in November 2022. Now, all stores under the Pick n Pay brand will allow customers to use CryptoQR to buy their groceries using bitcoin, according to an announcement by the payments platform on Twitter.
Customers will also be able to “buy airtime and electricity, plane and bus tickets, and pay your municipal bills with Bitcoin at the till!” according to the tweet.



Increasing usage at larger retailers like Pick n Pay introduces the concept of spending bitcoin as opposed to selling it for usability to new users of bitcoin. By allowing people to spend their BTC, the line between setting aside money for bitcoin and simply utilizing bitcoin as your money is blurred. The prior launch of the pilot noted that Pick n Pay will charge a small service fee for payments in BTC, “costing the customer on average 70c” of the local currency, or about $0.04 as of November 2022.
Pick n Pay has almost 2,000 stores across the country, Business Insider South Africa reported. The firm has a 16% market share of the country&#x27;s formal food and grocery sector, per the report.
The introduction of bitcoin to Pick n Pay&#x27;s stores is likely to have a significant impact on the broader bitcoin payments landscape in South Africa. It could bring the concept of using bitcoin as a form of payment to a wider audience, potentially stimulating more widespread adoption of bitcoin usage. Furthermore, it could inspire other major retailers to follow suit, further increasing the acceptance and usage of bitcoin as a payment method. This could be a major step forward in the wider adoption of bitcoin payments.</span>

                              <span>Litecoin raced to a nine-month high on Feb. 1, following a breakout of a key resistance level. The surge in price comes as the global cryptocurrency market cap rose marginally higher today, and is up by 0.57% as of writing. Cosmos was another notable mover, with prices up for a second straight session.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) surged to a nine-month high on Wednesday, as prices rose past a key resistance level.
 
LTC/USD hit a peak of $97.73 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $93.05.
 
As a result of the surge, litecoin rose to its strongest point since May 5, when prices were at a high of $106.86.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move took place following a breakout of a ceiling at $95.50, and came as the relative strength index (RSI) collided with a resistance of its own.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 65.96, which is marginally below a resistance level at 66.00.
 
Since approaching this point, earlier gains have somewhat declined, with LTC now trading at $95.58.
 
 
Cosmos (ATOM)
 
Cosmos (ATOM) was another notable mover in today’s session, with the token climbing for a second straight day.
 
Following a low of $13.15 on Tuesday, ATOM/USD moved to a peak of $13.84 earlier in the day.
 
Wednesday’s rally saw cosmos move above a ceiling at $13.50, nearing its highest point since November 8 in the process.
 
 
Whilst this resistance level was broken, the 14-day RSI was approaching one of its own at 66.00.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 61.77, after it bounced from a support point at 58.00
 
Should this ceiling at 66.00 be hit, it is likely that ATOM could be trading above the $14.00 mark.

Dogecoin Whale Transactions And Active Addresses Have Surged Recently
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, a couple of DOGE on-chain metrics are at two-month highs right now. The relevant indicators here are the whale transaction count and the daily active addresses.
 
The “whale transaction count” measures the total number of Dogecoin transfers taking place on the blockchain that is worth at least $100,000 in value. When the value of this metric is high, it means whales are actively trading the asset right now.
