Cryptocurrency Law Finally Sanctioned in Brazil
Brazil has, at last, approved its cryptocurrency law in the nick of time.

As Bitcoinist reported yesterday, redactions of all documents related to the summary judgment were due to be filed by the SEC and Ripple by yesterday. Both parties met that deadline in a timely manner. And the SEC’s filing reveals that it is still not ready to release the Hinman documents to the public.

A deputy governor of the Bank of England stated in a recent speech at Warwick Business School that the experience of the past few months illustrates that crypto is highly susceptible to the hazards that regulation in the traditional financial industry is intended to prevent.
 
Jon Cunliffe, the BOE deputy governor for financial stability, has reaffirmed his stance in the need to regulate cryptocurrencies, particularly in the aftermath of FTX’s demise.
 
Cunliffe emphasized the developing ties between the regular banking markets and crypto trading and highlighted the urgency of overseeing crypto before it can undermine the broader financial infrastructure.
