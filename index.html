BlackRock Takes Competitive Edge In Spot Bitcoin ETF Race
 
In a report published by Reuters in the early hours of Monday, the asset management giant announced that it has now set the fee at 0.20 percent for its iShares Bitcoin Trust, then increasing its fees to 0.30 positioning itself competitively against its rivals.
 
 
 
This strategic pricing undercuts the fees of Valkyrie Investments and Fidelity, which stand at 0.80 percent and 0.39 percent, respectively, for their spot BTC ETF offerings.

                              <span>Amid anticipations surrounding the potential  
approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product by the Securities and  
Exchange Commission (SEC), Chair Gary Gensler&#x27;s recent cautionary statements  
have cast a spotlight on the inherent risks within the crypto landscape. 
Gensler&#x27;s thread on social media, although not  
explicitly addressing the pending spot Bitcoin ETF decision, underscores the  
significant concerns around crypto investments, emphasizing their volatility  
and susceptibility to fraudulent schemes.
Gensler has warned against the risks inherent in  
cryptocurrency investments. His social media thread, albeit not explicitly tied  
to the awaited ETF approval, sheds light on the broader concerns surrounding  
crypto investments.

2⃣ Investments in crypto assets also can be exceptionally risky &amp; are often volatile. A number of major platforms &amp; crypto assets have become insolvent and/or lost value. Investments in crypto assets continue to be subject to significant risk.
— Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) January 8, 2024
Highlighting Risks and Volatility
Gensler&#x27;s cautionary tone concerns asset managers  
potentially bypassing federal securities laws with their crypto investment  
offerings. The SEC Chair&#x27;s commentary alludes to the possibility that certain  
investment assets may not align with established regulatory frameworks,  
prompting a call for investors&#x27; vigilance and due diligence.
Gensler&#x27;s remarks revolve around crypto investments&#x27;  
inherent volatility and vulnerability. His comments highlight the sector&#x27;s  
susceptibility to market fluctuations and emphasize the need for investors to  
exercise caution, particularly given the prevalence of fraudulent activities in  
the crypto space.
Expect ongoing updates as this story evolves.

                              <span>Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) could potentially commence live trading as early as Thursday or Friday, with approval happening this Wednesday, sources close to the matter told CNBC. 



This news comes amid intense anticipation for the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, a significant milestone anticipated to provide mainstream investors with a regulated avenue to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin.
&quot;Two sources close to the process now telling me it&#x27;s looking like Wednesday, which is also the deadline for Cathie Wood&#x27;s ARK and 21Shares bid,&quot; said CNBC anchor Kate Rooney. &quot;Then I&#x27;m told trading would happen Thursday or Friday, but it has been a moving target here on dates.&quot;
The imminent possibility of live trading for these ETFs signals a significant leap forward in the integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial markets. CNBC&#x27;s report adds to the growing speculation surrounding the imminent introduction of these ETFs, which have been eagerly awaited by both institutional and retail investors.
Should the live trading commence as projected, it would mark a historic moment for the Bitcoin industry, reflecting a seismic shift in the perception and adoption of BTC among traditional investors.
While the specific details and exact launch time remain speculative, the potential realization of Spot Bitcoin ETFs trading live signifies a culmination of rigorous regulatory evaluations and market readiness, bringing Bitcoin one step closer to wider acceptance and legitimacy within the financial landscape.</span>

Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley’s lead economist in the U.S., predicts rate reductions in the coming months. However, she cautions that the central bank has the luxury of patience, suggesting they are in no rush to make these changes.

                              <span>A bold statement has emerged from a former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Jay Clayton, suggesting that the approval of a Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is inevitable, stating that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing left to decide,&quot; in an interview with CNBC today.



The former SEC Chair&#x27;s confident proclamation hints at an imminent breakthrough in the regulatory landscape for Bitcoin-related financial products. This assertion aligns with the growing sentiment within the Bitcoin community, eagerly anticipating the approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF.
&quot;I think approval is inevitable, there&#x27;s nothing left to decide,&quot; Clayton said. &quot;Is the Bitcoin underlying trading market something that is robust enough, efficacious enough, where you can rely on it? It is much better today than it was five years ago.&quot;
These statements imply that key concerns or considerations previously hindering the approval process have been sufficiently addressed, paving the way for an inevitable green light from the SEC.
This bold declaration underscores the evolving sentiment within regulatory circles, reflecting a growing acceptance and understanding of Bitcoin. The potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is anticipated to mark a watershed moment in the financial sphere, enabling broader access for traditional investors seeking exposure to BTC through regulated investment vehicles.
&quot;The last thing, and I think this is missed, is the technology to actually provide the product,&quot; the former SEC Chair continued. &quot;The custodying, the create, the redeem. This is a big step, not just for Bitcoin but for finance generally.&quot;
The SEC is expected to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs by the end of day Wednesday. Bloomberg reported yesterday that if approved, the ETFs could be listed and starting to trade as soon as the next business day.</span>
