                              <span>Gold has seen a significant increase in value in 2023, with spot prices rising from $1,823 per ounce to the current price of $1,937 per ounce. However, Harry Dent, founder of HS Dent Investment Management, believes that this trend may not continue in the near future. Dent predicts that gold may lose value to the range of $900 to $1,000 over the next 18 months.
 
HS Dent Founder’s ‘Everything Bubble’ Theory and Its Potential Impact on the Economy

                              <span>Hackers broke through the social media accounts of Robinhood, a prominent US online trading platform, to peddle a fraudulent coin. The fake token is called RBH on the Binance Smart Chain.
 
Wednesday, the account released a tweet announcing the debut of the suspicious coin on BSC, with an initial price of $0.005. An analysis of the token reveals that creator and tokenomics information are missing.
 
 
Other social media profiles of Robinhood were also targeted. According to a BSC analysis provided by internet inspector ZackXBT, the fraudsters were able to extract around $8,200 worth of BNB tokens.

                              <span>Bitcoin rallied back above $23,000 on Thursday, following the release of Tesla’s quarterly earnings report. The report showed that Tesla was holding 9,720 bitcoin, worth $223 million. Ethereum was also higher, as prices were back above $1,600, rebounding from recent losses in the process.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) moved to a fresh five-month high earlier in the session, as markets reacted to Tesla’s latest quarterly earnings report.
 
The report, which was released after yesterday’s closing bell, showed that the electric vehicle maker did not sell any of its bitcoin.
 
Following the news, BTC/USD raced to a high of $23,722.10, hitting its strongest point since August 17 in the process.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move saw BTC once again break out of a ceiling at $23,500, and this comes after colliding with a floor at $22,500.
 
Earlier gains have somewhat eased, with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) back in overbought territory.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 80.77, with a support point at 78.00 the next visible target.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also rebounded in today’s session, with prices moving back above the $1,600 level.
 
ETH/USD, which slipped to a bottom of $1,535.00 on Wednesday, raced to a peak of $1,632.24 later in the day, following Tesla’s earnings call.
 
As a result of the move, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency rose past its recent resistance point at $1,600.
 
 
Like with BTC, previous bulls have somewhat abandoned their positions, opting to take profits as prices reentered overbought territory.
 
Ethereum’s 14-day RSI is currently sitting at 67.07, and appears to be heading for a ceiling at the 75.00 mark.
 
Should this occur, it is likely that ETH will collide with a ceiling at $1,685.

                              <span>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has surged recently. Here’s what it may mean for the price of the cryptocurrency.
 
Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio (72-Hour MA) Breaks Above 85%
 
As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC whale ratio is rising right now. The “exchange whale ratio” here is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 Bitcoin transfers to exchanges and the total exchange inflows.
 
Here, the 10 largest transactions going toward exchanges are assumed to be coming from the whales, which means that the indicator’s value tells us what part of the total exchange inflows is being contributed by these humongous holders right now.
 
When the whale ratio has a high value, it means a large percentage of the exchange deposits ar…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin was once viewed as a means to opt out of violent, legacy financial systems. Now, it is being co-opted by the very same, and zealous newcomers to crypto think that’s a good thing, while still giving lip service to peer-to-peer values. Ignoring the problems with fiat money, they beg political interests and bad actors to regulate Satoshi’s digital innovation. One such actor, Joe Biden, has been in the news recently complaining about not getting enough tax money from struggling Americans. To Biden and his elitist ilk, the destruction of crypto’s possibilities for economic sovereignty is a goal. Taxation is a key means to make that happen. To the crypto OGs, taxation is still theft, and permissionless, peer-to-peer exchange is still the answer.

In the report released yesterday, the Elon Musk-led company revealed that despite the recent market crash, it neither bought nor sold BTC in the fourth quarter. With this, Tesla proves that it does not have “weak hands” and believes in Bitcoin appreciation, even though the company’s Bitcoin investment is still in deficit.
 
Tesla made its most recent sale in the second quarter when it sold 75% of its Bitcoin holdings, worth $936 million. Musk’s company held $184 million in Bitcoin (estimated at 9,720 BTC) as of Dec. 31, down about $34 million in the fourth quarter from $218 million …</span>

Kazakhstan’s Financial Watchdog Goes After Unlicensed Crypto Exchange Services
 
The Financial Monitoring Agency (FMA) of the Republic of Kazakhstan has dismantled a group involved in the illegal exchange of cryptocurrencies. Its members organized the trading through several websites such as kzobmen.com, 1wm.kz, kazobmen.ru, wm007.kz, and kz-exchange.com.
 
As part of the operation in Kostanay region, searches were carried out at six locations, in which items incriminating the operators of the platforms were seized, the watchdog said in …</span>

                              <span>In the past year, bitcoin’s price has declined by about 60% from its all-time high. This has diminished the excitement surrounding the alpha coin, but not entirely.
 
There are still many who have faith in the cryptocurrency’s future. One of them is Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers.
 
Rogers, a Republican, has presented legislation that would make bitcoin legal currency in Arizona and allow state agencies to accept it.
 
The law proposed on Wednesday would, if passed, make Arizona the first state in the United States to recognize bitcoin as a legal form of currency.
 
The proposals are co-sponsored by Rogers’ Republican colleagues in the state senate, J.D. Mesnard and Jeff Weninger.

Critics cite the original distribution of XRP to Ripple on the one hand and the functionality of the XRP ledger on the other. Back in May 2017, Ripple announced a strategy to increase decentralization and ensure that no single entity has operational control over the XRP Ledger.
