                              <span>Crypto exchange Binance has decided to conduct a hiring drive amidst the market turmoil, especially when rival exchanges have been laying off employees constantly.
 
The crypto exchange will, or at least is planning to, increase its workforce by 15-30% in 2023, as mentioned by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao at the Crypto Finance Conference held in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
 
 
Zhao stated:
 

We will continue to build and hopefully we will ramp up again before the next bull market.
 
With the new hiring drive, Binance aims to add to the 5,000 workers that were hired in the previous year, as stated by Zhao at the conference. At the moment, Binance has been reported to have 687 job openings on its website’s careers page.

                              <span>For the Bitcoin price, the course for the rest of January may have been set today. The question was: Will Bitcoin continue its mini-bull run or will there be a correction? This was decided by today’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) release in the US at 8:30 am EST.
 
The baseline was relatively clear. Most estimates agreed that 6.5% is the magic line that will decide whether it is a bull or bear market in the short term. If the figure is 6.3% or lower, there will be a bull run as the US central bank projections from the last FOMC are no longer credible and will be thrown overboard.
 
At 6.3% to 6.5%, the market is likely to celebrate with restraint, although this may already be priced in. At 6.5% to 7.1%, there will be a sell-off.
 
And the estimates were spot on. The CPI came in at 6.5%

This is an opinion editorial by Mark Maraia, a professional development author and Bitcoin researcher.
I’ve been studying Bitcoin since 2020 and I’ve noticed there is a strong, vibrant community on Twitter. In fact, “Bitcoin Twitter” is virtually its own “country” that exists online. 
I’ve had a Twitter account since 2009, but I never use it to tweet. There are several reasons for this (perhaps the subject of a different article) but, suffice to say, I’ve never found it to be a great use of my time. Like many Boomers, I see social media as a huge time and productivity drain. I also see it as perhaps the worst addiction of our age.

With stocks being highly correlated with digital currencies, a worsening macroeconomic situation would be devastating for the broader financial market. But with the World Bank predicting that the global economy can slip into recession, the crypto market recovery might not happen this year. 
 
 As the macro trends worsen, cash that is crucial for the recovery of the market will flow out as investors flock to safe haven assets.

                              <span>Bitcoin rose to a four-week high on Thursday, as price surged above $18,000 hours before the upcoming U.S. inflation report. This comes as many expect today’s figures to show a considerable drop in consumer prices. Ethereum also moved higher, climbing above $1,400 in the process.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) surged above $18,000 on Thursday, as markets prepared for a further drop in U.S. consumer prices.
 
BTC/USD raced to an intraday high of $18,268.55 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $17,337.99.
 
Today’s move saw bitcoin climb to its strongest point since December 14, when prices were at a peak of $18,385.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the rally took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to move deeper into overbought territory
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 75.98, which is its highest mark since October 2021.
 
Depending on this afternoon’s inflation rate, there could be a reversal in BTC, as earlier momentum may have already peaked.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) was also significantly higher in today’s session, with prices moving to a two-month high.
 
Following a low of $1,323.58 on Wednesday, ETH/USD jumped to a peak of $1,408.13 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of this rally, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency is now trading at its strongest position since November 8.
 
 
Like with bitcoin earlier, the move has occurred as the RSI broke out of a ceiling at 69.00, and it is currently tracking at 75.89.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has continued its upwards crossover versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should this momentum maintain this trajectory, then the next target for bulls will likely be a ceiling of $1,470.

Bitcoin Percent Supply In Profit Has Grown To 60.5% Now
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the supply in profit was below 50% not too long ago. The “percent supply in profit” is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that’s carrying some amount of profit right now.
 
The metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last traded at. If this previous price for any coin was less than the current value of BTC, then that particular coin is holding some profit at the moment, and the indicator accounts for it in the data.
