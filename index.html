The Purchasing Power of the U.S. Dollar After the Creation of the Federal Reserve on Dec. 24, 1913 Dwindles Lower
 
During the last hundred years, economists have blamed the U.S. Federal Reserve for a great deal of America’s rising inflation. American economist and social theorist Thomas Sowell referred to the Fed as a “cancer,” and former politcians like Ron Paul have called on the masses to abolish the Fed. Prior to the creation of the Fed on Dec. 23, 1913, America had two central banks the preceded the current U.S. central bank.

This is an opinion editorial by Obi Nwosu, CEO of Fedi and a board member for ₿trust.
In 2020, I predicted that Bitcoin would face attacks during the 2018 to 2023 period but would ultimately emerge successful by the end of it. Although I am not a prophet, it was clear to me that this would be a critical time for Bitcoin. When the bear market hit this year, we saw a &quot;cleansing&quot; of the Bitcoin ecosystem and an opportunity to refocus on its main mission of monetary freedom.
The snowball started in the heat of July with the Celsius bankruptcy, which was the first sign that the ecosystem we were building was not healthy. The fact that we were using a decentralized currency to mirror the…</span>

On Dec. 22, 2022, the password management firm Lastpass disclosed that an “unknown threat actor” managed to breach the firm’s cloud-based storage environment in or around Aug. 2022. As soon as the news was published, the Lastpass data leak has been a topical discussion on social media and forums.

                              <span>Following FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s arrest and the statements from his co-workers Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, the spotlight has turned on the remaining executives who were part of the team’s inner circle. Another person people are curious about these days is Alameda Research’s ex-co-CEO Sam Trabucco. The 30-year-old executive left Alameda in Aug. 2022, but since Ellison detailed misconduct happened in 2019, it’s assumed that Trabucco knows a thing or two about what happened.
 
Spotlights Remain on a Few More FTX and Alameda Execs Like Sam Trabucco
 
Since Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was arrested and then later released on bail, attention has been drawn toward executives who have not come forward, or at least not publicly announced they have been cooperating with law enforcement.

In the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances. 
 
We kicked us this special with an institutional guest, asset management firm Blofin. In early December, they wrote an essay called “Catastrophe, Survival, and Evolution: Writing After November’s Crypto Markets” which inspired this series.

Privacy Economy Loses 55% Against the Greenback, European Union Looks to Ban Anonymizing Cryptos
 
Privacy coins are not talked about like they used to be. These days, the hype and discussions surrounding decentralized finance (defi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have eclipsed privacy coin conversations.

Solana (SOL) was in the red on Saturday, as prices moved lower for a fourth straight session.
 
SOL/USD slipped to a low of $11.24 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after the token was trading at $11.95.
 
Today’s drop saw solana fall to its lowest point since November 22, when price hit a low of $10.94.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, Saturday’s decline came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a floor at 34.00.
 
The index is currently tracking at 31.79, with the next visible point of support at the 29.90 level.
 
Should the RSI continue to head to this point, it is likely that solana will fall below the $10.94 level, which was last seen four weeks ago.
 
 
Uniswap (UNI)
 
Uniswap (UNI) also moved lower to start the weekend, as the token extended a recent bear run.
 
Following a high of $5.32 on Friday, UNI/USD fell to an intraday low of $5.20 on Christmas Eve.
 
The move led to uniswap landing on its long-term point of support, with bears likely to force a breakout as the weekend matures.
 
 
As of writing, the token remains marginally above its $5.20 floor, and is currently trading at $5.22.
 
Should this floor be broken, a possible target for sellers will possibly be a floor at $4.95, which was last hit in late November.

                              <span>This year was a turning point for Bitcoin and its community is now ready to cut the dead weight of price speculation.
This is an opinion editorial by Ray Youssef, a founder and CEO of Paxful and a founder of the Built With Bitcoin Foundation.
Bitcoin has had a defining year in 2022 and, as I look back, I couldn’t be more excited for 2023. We’re at a turning point. It is clear that Bitcoin is starting to cut the dead weight of speculation. All eyes are on us and it’s our responsibility to educate people and governments about why Bitcoin has real-life use cases that will allow money to flow freely and include billions more into the global economy. I’m ready to onboard the next billion Bitcoiners.
Here are my 2022 takeaways and predictions for 2023:

                              <span>Bitcoin rose closer to the $17,000 level on Saturday, despite crypto markets mostly consolidating to start the week. The global cryptocurrency market cap is down 0.32% as of writing. Ethereum was also higher earlier in the day, with prices nearing the $1,230 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) remained under the $17,000 level to start the weekend, as prices continued to consolidate despite earlier gains.
 
BTC/USD hit a high of $16,905.22 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after price was at a bottom, at the $16,793.53 mark.
 
The move saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency continue to trade above a key point of support at $16,800.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failed to break above a ceiling at 48.00.
 
The index is currently trading at 46.72, with bulls still attempting to push past the aforementioned point of resistance.
 
On the other hand, should price strength decline below a floor at 45.00, bitcoin will likely move towards the $16,000 level.
 
 
Ethereum
 
In addition to BTC, ethereum (ETH) also consolidated to start the weekend, with prices edging closer to a key resistance level.
 
Following a low of $1,216.34 on Friday, ETH/USD raced to a peak of $1,227.00 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of today’s move, ethereum once again attempted to break out of a key ceiling at the $1,230 level.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the breakout did not occur, mainly due to the RSI also remaining below a ceiling of its own at 47.50.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 47.12, with momentum appearing to be bearish as a result of the direction of moving averages (MA).
 
The 10-day (red) MA extended its downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which typically is a sign of price declines.
