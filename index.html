                              <span>Litecoin’s halving is a little over a month away, and historically, the cryptocurrency has peaked prior to this recurring event.
 
But this time very well could be different, as LTCUSD is exhibiting more similarities with a previous point — just before an incredible breakout performance. With a comparable technical setup returning, will the altcoin soar like the last time? Or like past halvings, is the top already in?

 In the US, it’s been a turbulent situation with regulatory bodies and some politicians behaving hostile to crypto, while BlackRock, which is filing an ETF application, has opened up the possibility of a more welcoming environment. In the EU, MiCA has been approved, creating the impression of a continent moving quickly towards crypto acceptance and looking to set a global standard. Additionally, Asia, Hong Kong and Singapore are often mentioned as potential crypto hubs, while Japan, too, appears to be taking an open-minded approach.
 Another region of particular interest, though, is the UK, which now – post-Brexit – is opera…</span>

According to a statement released today, Dutch crypto exchange Coinmerce claims it has agreed with the Seychelles-based company to refer its thousands of Dutch users to the Coinmerce trading platform.
 
Launched in 2017, Coinmerce is a Dutch-based cryptocurrency exchange with operations in 11 other countries. It claims to be one of the first crypto platforms to be registered with the Dutch Central Bank – De Nederlandsche Bank. 
 
Back in June, Binance announced it would shut down its operations in the Netherlands on July 17 after it could not obtain a Dutch government’s virtual assets service provider (VASP) license.
