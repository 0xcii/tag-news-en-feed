The transaction, which involved transferring the funds into cryptocurrency, is believed to have been an attempt to circumvent US sanctions.
 
Crypto Company Copper Technologies Under Fire
 
According to a report by The Guardian, Mikhail Klyukin faced sanctions due to his role on the supervisory board of Russian lender Sovcombank, following the invasion of Ukraine and the US’s targeting of “elites close to Vladimir Putin.” 
 
 
Copper Technologies, a company specializing in digital systems for cryptocurrency investment and trading, became concerned when Klyukin, who owned more…</span>

                              <span>Bartek Kiepuszewski, the co-founder of L2Beat, a portal for tracking Ethereum layer-2 activities, is concerned about the security and consistency of existing off-chain scaling solutions, suggesting that without fraud-proofs, there is room for fraud and irregularities.
 
Focus On Optimism And Manta: What’s Going On?
 
Taking to X on December 20, Kiepuszewski observed that some layer-2 solutions, such as Manta and Optimism, rely on sequencers to post data to Ethereum. However, without fraud-proofs, there is no way to verify that the data published by the Sequencer on the Ethereum mainnet is accurate or complete. 
 
In the co-founder’s view, whenever a sequencer posts the batch of transactions on the main net, there is no layer-1 state or event change. Per Kiepuszewski ‘s assessment, this is …</span>

XRP Holders Need Deeper Conviction
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bill Morgan said that convictions (likely in reference to XRP holders) need to be “deeper than a day, week, or month of price action.” He mentioned how he doesn’t read much into a month’s price action in the crypto market. 
 
 
Before then, the legal expert had highlighted how XRP’s price action hasn’t been great, as it is down over 2% over the last month. Although the 2% drop seems to be significant to Morgan, he was choosi…</span>
