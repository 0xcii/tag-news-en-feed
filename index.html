                              <span>Bitcoin&#x27;s recent price volatility has led many to wonder if large-scale bitcoin hodlers are taking advantage of price dips to accumulate more bitcoin. While some metrics may initially suggest an increase in long-term holdings, a closer examination reveals a more nuanced story, especially after the current prolonged period of choppy consolidation.
Are Long-Term Holders Accumulating?
Upon initial observation, long-term Bitcoin holders are seemingly increasing their holdings. According to the Long Term Holder Supply, since July 30th, the amount of BTC held by long-term holders has increased from 14.86 million to 15.36 million BTC. This surge of around 500,000 BTC has led some to believe that long-term holders are aggressively buying the dip, potentially setting the stage for the next signific…</span>

                              <span>Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price actions have been unimpressive in the last 24 hours. This is mainly thanks to Bitcoin’s strong price correlation with the foremost meme coins, with the flagship crypto’s price also on the decline. 
 
Why Dogecoin And Shiba Inu’s Prices Are Down
 
Dogecoin and Shiba Inu’s prices are down due to their strong positive price correlation with Bitcoin. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Dogecoin’s price correlation with Bitcoin is currently at 0.97, while Shiba Inu’s price correlation with the flagship crypto is at 0.91.

                              <span>Coinbase has reported that updated 2Q 2024 13-F filings indicate a notable increase in institutional inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which the company views as a &quot;promising indicator&quot; for the Bitcoin market. The 13-F filings, released on August 14, reveal that institutional ownership of these ETFs grew from 21.4% to 24.0% between Q1 and Q2 of 2024.
Significantly, the proportion of ETF shares held by the &quot;investment advisor&quot; category rose from 29.8% to 36.6%, signaling heightened interest from wealth management firms. Notable new holders include Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who added $412 million and $188 million worth of shares, respectively. Despite Bitcoin&#x27;s price drop during the quarter, net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $2.4 billion.
&quot;The ETF complex saw net inflows of $2.4B during this period, although the total AUM of spot bitcoin ETFs dropped from $59.3B to $51.8B (due to BTC dropping from $70,700 to $60,300),&quot; Coinbase reported. &quot;We think that the continued ETF inflows during bitcoin’s underperformance may be a promising indicator of sustained interest in crypto from the new pools of capital that the ETFs give access to.&quot;
 
                         
                         
                        
Coinbase And Bloomberg
 
                     
                    
Coinbase expects this growth to continue as more brokerage houses complete their due diligence on Bitcoin ETFs, particularly among registered investment advisors. However, the report also notes that short-term inflows may be tempered by seasonal factors and current market volatility.
&quot;In our view, it’s likely that we will see the proportion of investment advisor holdings continue to increase as more brokerage houses complete their due diligence on these funds,&quot; the report stated. &quot;We may not immediately see large inflows emerge in the short-term, as soliciting clients may be harder to do during the summer, when more people are on vacation, liquidity tends to be thinner and the price action might be choppy.&quot;</span>

Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Coming Soon?
 
Recent activities may indicate significant strides towards the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF Options. Notably, key market players such as NASDAQ, NYSE, and CBOE have retracted their initial filings. While CBOE already submitted a more detailed application shortly thereafter, NASDAQ and NYSE are expecting to follow suit.

                              <span>Recent data from Bitcoin Magazine Pro shows a significant trend among Bitcoin holders: nearly 75% of all circulating Bitcoin has remained dormant for over six months. This strong HODLing behavior reflects a steadfast belief in Bitcoin&#x27;s long-term value, despite market fluctuations.

The &quot;HODL Waves&quot; chart, a tool that visualizes the age of Bitcoins based on when they last moved, illustrates how various groups of holders react to market conditions. The dominance of older coins (those held for 6 months or more) suggests that long-term investors are increasingly holding onto their Bitcoin, possibly anticipating future price increases.
This trend of HODLing is significant because it indicates a reduced supply of Bitcoin available for trading, which could lead to increased price stability or even potential price appreciation as demand grows. The data also highlights the contrast between short-term traders and long-term investors, with the latter group—often considered &#x27;smart money&#x27;—likely to hold their positions during periods of market volatility.
For new Bitcoin investors, this trend emphasizes the potential benefits of adopting a long-term investment strategy. Consistently buying and holding Bitcoin over time, rather than attempting to time the market, aligns with the behavior of those who have historically seen the most significant gains holding Bitcoin.

The verdict will have a massive impact on both parties, while an appeal from both sides is also on the cards. 
 
What Next For Ripple And The SEC
 
Ripple will have to pay the SEC a $125 million fine for violating securities laws. This violation resulted from the firm’s sale of XRP to institutional investors without first registering these transactions as investment contracts. Last year, Judge Torres ruled that Ripple violated securities laws through its institutional sales, although she declared that XRP isn’t a security in itself.
