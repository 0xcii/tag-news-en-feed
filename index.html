                              <span>Hong Kong regulators are set to greenlight the inaugural  
batch of applications for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the  
upcoming week, potentially paving the way for these financial products to hit  
the market as early as April. Sources familiar with the matter disclosed this  
information to Reuters, highlighting a significant development in the financial  
landscape.
Asian Markets Eye Bitcoin ETF Approvals
If approved, these ETFs would mark a milestone for the Asian  
market, with Hong Kong and Australia emerging as frontrunners in offering such  
investment instruments. While Singapore and the United Arab Emirates have  
yet to signal immediate intentions in this regard, Hong Kong&#x27;s regulatory  
authorities appear to be accelerating the approval process, according to  
statements cited in the Reuters report.
Among the entities seeking approval, Harvest Global  
Investments, an asset management firm from China, and asset manager VSFG, in  
partnership with Value Partners, have submitted applications to the Securities  
and Futures Commission (SFC) for a spot ETF, as reported by CoinDesk. The  
report also mentioned that four entities, including the Hong Kong units of  
China Asset Management, Harvest Fund Management, and Bosera Asset Management,  
have applied to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Nevertheless, regulatory approval does not necessarily  
guarantee immediate market availability, as additional steps may be required  
before these ETFs are ready for trading. Investors and stakeholders alike will  
be closely monitoring developments in this space, anticipating the impact of  
spot Bitcoin ETFs on the broader financial landscape.

The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has expedited the approval process, positioning Hong Kong as a pioneer in Asia&#x27;s Bitcoin ETF space. The move comes ahead of industry expectations for launches later this year.
Multiple Chinese financial institutions, including the Hong Kong subsidiaries of Harvest Fund and China Southern Fund, have applied for bitcoin ETFs recently. Spot bitcoin ETFs provide exposure to actual bitcoin rather than derivatives.
According to sources, the SFC will announce its first approved batch of spot bitcoin ETFs on April 15. After approvals, the funds can then be applied to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which is expected to take 10 days.
This accelerated timeline demonstrates Hong Kong&#x27;s proactive approach in enhancing its appeal as a global financial hub. It also builds on the city&#x27;s Bitcoin-friendly stance, including granting crypto exchange Hashkey a retail trading license last year.
The news comes after the tremendous success of spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States after approval this January, which attracted over $12 billion in inflows. As the first Asian jurisdiction to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, Hong Kong is paving the way for potential launches in other markets.
Accessible Bitcoin investment products have seen rapid growth in demand among both institutional and retail investors. By leveraging its regulatory framework to meet this appetite, Hong Kong cements its position as a rising Bitcoin hub in Asia.</span>

The lawsuit, filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), accuses the government of false prosecution and a series of other serious allegations spanning from 2019 to 2023.
 
Ethereum Insider Vs. The US Govt
 
Nerayoff’s announcement of the lawsuit came through a post on X (formerly Twitter), where he vehemently expressed, “Today I have filed my Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) lawsuit suing the US government for personal damages related to false prosecution.

Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness a $94 million outflow, although outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may decelerate. Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase&#x27;s premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin&#x27;s all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance. Solana&#x27;s (SOL) decentralized exchange (DEX) achieves a monthly volume of $50 billion, with revenue soaring 30-fold. OKX announces support for a new Solana token standard. Despite expectations, Layer 2 activity remains sluggish post-Dencun, according to Vitalik Buterin.</span>
