However, a research report by Grayscale, a prominent digital asset investment firm, uncovers a significant transformation in this paradigm over the past three years. The report delves into the evolving correlation between BTC and macroeconomic trends, revealing how the once-isolated market now intertwines with broader market indicators.
 
Dawn Of A New Era For Bitcoin And Crypto
 
In the past, Bitcoin and crypto operated in relative isolation from traditional markets, showing little correlation with equities or currencies. This scenario began to shift with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, which acted as a catalyst for changing dynamics.

Central Bank of Argentina Delays Dollar Disbursements to Importers
 
The government of Argentina is now being accused of delaying the delivery of dollars to Argentine importers by using freight costs as an excuse.

The lack of the technical tool being triggered in BTC and ETH suggests that these two front runners could lag behind the lower-ranked altcoins. Here’s a closer look at why.
 
Explaining The Parabolic SAR In Crypto
 
Cryptocurrencies are known for their impressive, parabolic rallies, that later causes prices to reach extreme overvaluations. When the parabola breaks down, the trend tends to reverse into a brutal bear market. Understanding when these trend changes occur is the key to being profitable in the crypto market.

The NFT, technically a digital certificate of ownership, was purchased by Sina Estavi, the CEO of Malaysia-based cryptocurrency company Bridge Oracle. Estavi had plans to sell the NFT for $48 million and donate half of the proceeds to charity. 
 
However, the NFT has since lost almost all of its value. As of July 20, the highest bid for the NFT is just $3.82, according to data from OpenSea, one of the world’s largest NFT marketplaces. Further details reveal that the highest bid received recently was $47.78.

                              <span>The New York Times has reported that Caroline Ellison, the 27-year-old CEO of crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, could be a key witness in the upcoming criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. 
 
Bankman-Fried is accused of misusing billions of dollars taken from customer accounts and faces eight counts of fraud and election law violations.
 
Ellison, who was also a top executive in Mr. Bankman-Fried’s business empire, is said to have recorded her thoughts on private Google documents that have been reviewed by the New York Times. 
 
The documents, which have not been previously reported, offer new insight into Ellison’s psychology during the final months of FTX.
