                              <span>So far in July, the Bitcoin price has shown positive movement, emerging from the bearish trend of June and rising to new monthly highs. While this increase has been encouraging, it still leaves doubt in the hearts of investors, as the BTC price remains below $70,000. With the month drawing close to a rapid end, the question remains if the Bitcoin price will finish out this month in the green or if it will succumb to the bears once again.
 
How Bitcoin Price Has Performed Historically

On July 23, the budget brought up by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman left the digital currency industry unaddressed even after prior speculations and anticipation of potential regulatory clarifications or supportive measures.
 
This omission comes at a time when the global digital currency industry is seeing various levels of adoption and regulation, highlighting a stark contrast in India’s approach to handling these digital assets.

                              <span>Recent price action indicates that Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently underperforming compared to other major cryptocurrencies. Over the past seven days, SHIB has experienced a significant decline of 7.26%, and in just the last 24 hours, the token has fallen by an additional 2.58%. This downturn is particularly noteworthy when compared with the performance of Dogecoin (DOGE), its meme coin counterpart. Unlike SHIB, Dogecoin has enjoyed a robust 12% increase over the same seven-day time frame. 
 
One key factor contributing to SHIB’s recent struggles is a noticeable decline in several crucial Shibarium metrics over the past 24 hours. Shibarium, the L2 blockchain network associated with Shiba Inu, has seen a drop in user engagement, transaction volume, and other important indicators, which has li…</span>

Bitcoin Miner Revenue Is Now Close To Its 365-Day SMA
 
In a new post on X, analyst James Van Straten has discussed about how the situation of the BTC miners is looking like right now. There are different ways to gauge the condition of the miners, with a popular one being the hashrate, which is a measure of the total computing power connected to the Bitcoin network.
 
 
Here, though, the analyst has made use of the daily total revenue of these chain validators. There are two parts to miner revenue: block subsidy and transaction fees.
 
The first of these refers to the BTC rewards that miners receive as compensation for solving blocks on the network…</span>
