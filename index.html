Snowden’s statement came in the wake of a significant market disruption that saw Berkshire Hathaway shares plummet by 99% due to a technical glitch on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This incident has reignited discussions about the robustness and reliability of traditional financial systems versus decentralized alternatives.
 
Bitcoin Fixes This
 
A technical glitch on the NYSE triggered extreme price swings in several securities, causing a temporary suspension of trading. Approximately two hours after the NYSE halted trading, it was reported that all systems were operational again.

Kraken’s Historic Outflows, What Is Going On?
 
Insights from Joao Wedson of Dominando Cripto shared on CryptoQuant’s quick-take platform highlight a startling trend at Kraken. The exchange recorded an outflow of 49,100 BTC, translating to approximately $3.33 billion.
 
 
This massive withdrawal marks the largest movement of funds from the exchange in dollar terms. Ethereum was not left behind, with roughly 572,100 ETH, valued at around $2.15 billion, also exiting the platform.

Block Earner offered several cryptocurrency-based fixed-yield earning products, including USD Earner, Gold Earner, and Crypto Earner, collectively known as Earner Products. The company operated as an AUSTRAC-registered digital currency exchange but did not hold an Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence.

                              <span>Chamath Palihapitiya, a well-known billionaire investor, has joined the dialogue about future Bitcoin Halving events and their implications for the asset in the long term.
 
According to the Billionaire, this notable event that occurs in the Bitcoin ecosystem every four years could propel Bitcoin’s value to as high as $500,000 in the upcoming years, and here’s how.
 
 
Post-Halving Price Movements: A Historical Insight
 
The premier cryptocurrency has historically shown significant price movements post-halving, with most substantial gains typically occurring 12 to 18 months after the event.
 
Palihapitiya points out that while the price tends to show modest increases initially, substantial surges have followed previous Halvings. For instance, the first Halving led to a more than tenfold in…</span>

                              <span>Australia now officially has its first spot Bitcoin ETF that directly holds BTC. The Monochrome Asset Management&#x27;s Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) just began trading as the Cboe Australia exchange opened. Trading under the ticker IBTC, the ETF carries a management fee of 0.98%.

— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 4, 2024
  
  
  
This milestone makes IBTC the first fund in the country to offer direct Bitcoin holdings, providing investors with straightforward access to BTC. This new product stands apart from the two existing spot Bitcoin ETFs in Australia, which provide exposure to spot Bitcoin without holding Bitcoin directly. Monochrome&#x27;s ETF fills this gap, by providing an ETF that actually holds Bitcoin.
“Before IBTC, Australian investors were only able to invest in ETFs that indirectly hold bitcoin or through offshore bitcoin products, both of which don’t benefit from the investor protection rules under the directly held crypto asset Australian Financial Services Licensing (AFSL) licensing regime,” the company stated.
This development in Australia follows the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year. These ETFs have seen considerable success, reflecting strong investor interest and confidence in Bitcoin. Additionally, Bitcoin ETPs have gone live on the London Stock Exchange, and Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Commodities (ETCs) have gone live in Germany as well, further highlighting the global trend towards accessible Bitcoin investment products.</span>
