SBF Wants to Start a New Business
 
Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), former CEO of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX, was asked in an interview with the BBC, published Saturday, whether he planned to start a new business venture to earn the money to pay FTX investors and customers back. The former FTX boss replied:
 

I would give anything to be able to do that. And I’m going to try if I can.
 
He added: “I’m going to be thinking about how we can help the world and if users haven’t gotten much back, I’m going to be thinking about what I can do for them. And I think at…</span>

                              <span>Bahamian authorities have arrested Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and ex-CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, after the U.S. filed criminal charges.
Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has been arrested in the Bahamas by local authorities.
The arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the U.S. that it had filed criminal charges against SBF, per a statement from the Attorney General of the Bahamas. SBF’s extradition to the U.S. will likely be requested.
SBF has been on the news for a couple of years, but it wasn’t until recently that such coverage turned a dark corner. The Jane Street alumni turned crypto founder ultimately led his creations, FTX and Alameda Research, to insolvency as SBF’s severe mismanagement of users’ funds came to light. He then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and resigned as CEO.
The disgraced entrepreneur then went on an unusual interview spree, talking about the companies and his version of the story to as many journalists willing to give him a stage. Notably, however, SBF would only deflect from answering the tougher questions, reaching a point where he said he “didn’t knowingly commingle users’ funds.”
Now, the story is set to take a new twist as prosecutors move to unseal the indictment on Tuesday morning. A source familiar with the matter told The New York Times that charges brought against SBF include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin is a fair and transparent system because its rules are set and consistently enforced, allowing for a level playing field for all participants.
This is an opinion editorial by Tim Niemeyer, a Bitcoiner since circa 2018 and co-host of the Lincolnland Bitcoin Meetup in Springfield, Illinois.

Let’s pretend we’re playing a game of baseball. Aside from the occasional blind umpire, the rules are pretty fair and consistent. In our particular game though, let’s pretend I’m not only the opposition but also the umpire, rule maker and historian. When you score a run, I can overturn the call. After the game, I can change whatever rule could have prevented your run in…</span>

Musk further added that the deletions would be obvious accounts that have no tweets or they haven’t logged in for years. However, after Musk announced this plan, a great number of cryptocurrency proponents have grown concerned that Hal Finney’s account would be among the purged names. Finney, who passed away in Aug. 2014, was the first to mention bitcoin in a tweet on the public forum.

Bucharest, Romania,12/12/22, Chainwire:
 
After experiencing success in the crypto space, DeFi Yield Protocol announces a complete rebranding to Dypius. The experienced team conducted several months’ worth of research to come up with the best way to represent what they had evolved into over the years. Dypius has the suffix of the nebulae in the galaxy. Nebulas are the formations of gas, dust, and other materials that “clump” together to form denser regions in the universe. They attract further matter and eventually become dense enough to form stars, planets, and planetary system objects. Dypius is the place of creation of stars, planets, and life. This is Dypius, a place to create and shape the future!
 
DYP began as a DeFi protocol at the dawn of decentralized finance, of…</span>

                              <span>The hunt for Terra founder Do Kwon has been ongoing for months now since the network collapsed. South Korean authorities continue their search and have already gone as far as invalidating Kwon’s passport but he continues to be elusive. This time around, authorities believe that they may have located where the founder is currently hiding and are reportedly working with the Serbian government to get him back to South Korea.
 
Do Kwon Is In Serbia?
 
The South Korean prosecutors have seemingly been following Do Kwon around the world. Previously, authorities had said that they believed that Kwon was in Dubai. However, they now believe that the Terra founder made his way to Serbia from Dubai last month.
 
 
Kwon currently has a red notice him issued by Interpol, making him one of the most wante…</span>

                              <span>Cryptocurrency mining in Cuba has been interrupted for some time due to the electricity crisis on the Caribbean island. Several parts of Cuba have experienced repeated blackouts, which have made mining rigs in Cuba unsustainable and even impossible in certain cases.
 
This has caused many Cubans to lose thousands of dollars that they had invested in procuring crypto-mining equipment and graphics cards. The constant electricity blackouts have led to consistent interruptions to the mining hardware, which has hindered the potential income of the operators.
