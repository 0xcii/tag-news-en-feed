                              <span>As 2024 progresses, AI-driven cryptocurrencies are gaining more attention from investors, especially whales, who are trading on green candles. Two of the most promising projects leading the charge are Injective (INJ) and GoodEgg (GEGG), both of which have seen significant movement in their respective markets. While Injective (INJ) is signaling a potential breakout, GoodEgg (GEGG) is rapidly gaining attention with its innovative “Play-2-Date” feature.
