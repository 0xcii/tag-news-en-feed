                              <span>Ah, the wild west. John Wayne, the Man with No Name, Billy the Kid and Jesse James. 
The frontier has a way of capturing everyone’s imagination – young and old. The cowboys, the outlaws, the gold prospectors. A land of opportunity and harsh cruelty. Unforgiving yet irresistible. 
Bitcoin was once such a frontier. The early days were rife with scams, “criminals” and underground markets. The underbelly of the internet embraced it first. It was an agora filled with foreign and obscure figures. It thrived as a counterculture, void of any rules and regulations. No government to protect you from yourself. No KYC, no AML – only your name, your PGP key, gribble, and the Web-Of-Trust. Fortunes were made, and fortunes were lost. A beautiful chaos where only the authority of the Bitcoin blockchain re…</span>

                              <span>Alexey Pertsev, a developer for the Ethereum-based crypto mixer Tornado Cash, has been sentenced to 64 months in prison after a Dutch court found him guilty of money laundering charges on Tuesday.
The judge stated that the platform was &quot;intended for criminals&quot; and that Pertsev should have been suspicious of the criminal origins of transactions.
The closely-watched case marks a major blow to financial privacy advocates. Many critics argue that Pertsev is being unfairly targeted as the developer of an open-source platform. 
Further, they say he did not have control over how users chose to employ Tornado Cash to obscure transaction histories on the public blockchain.
Nonetheless, prosecutors successfully argued that Pertsev did too little to prevent the mixer from being utilized for money laundering. 
They rejected claims that his obligations were lessened due to the decentralized nature of the platform&#x27;s operations.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
Experts predict it will have a chilling effect on development of open-source tools that enable anonymity on Bitcoin and other blockchains. They argue it sets a precedent for holding developers liable for the actions of anonymous users.
Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in 2022 over allegations it obscured funds stolen by North Korean state hackers. Pertsev was arrested days later, dealing a major blow to the embryonic crypto privacy sector.</span>

                              <span>The Terra community isn’t relenting in its efforts to revive the LUNC and USTC tokens and take them back to their old glory days. This time, the community has proposed a proposal to ensure that the Luna Classic’s (LUNC) circulating supply data is well documented. 
 
Terra Community Proposes All Allnodes As An Official Organization
 
The text proposal titled ‘Change official CS API endpoint to Allnodes FCD’ aims to make Allnodes an official organization of the Terra community. Allnodes will be responsible for “hosting the endpoint, providing the correct circulating supply data for Luna Classic.” The proposal also aims to get an agreement from community members about how this circulating supply should be calculated.
