Ark Labs has announced it is developing the Bitcoin layer-two network and hopes to capitalize on the growing demand for scalable, low-cost Bitcoin payment solutions.
Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Marco Argentieri, CEO of Ark Labs, shared his perspective on the evolution of the protocol since its initial release. 
“After months of prototyping and putting together proofs-of-concept, we believe Ark is ready to enter the next stage of its development and we are excited to share this opportunity with the industry”.

                              <span>Death and taxes and 21 million Bitcoin. That is what we know to be certain. The rest is conjecture. Today I wanted to share my big bets on the next halving. I am sure I will cringe in 4 years at some of these “prophecies” but some of them will come true. I don’t have a ton of data to back up these predictions, some are gut feelings, others are random. All I know is that the future is weird. 
3 Zeta Hash Mining
Based on my experience mining during the previous cycle, I learned a valuable lesson in trying to estimate hashrate, think log not linear. The current hashrate exceeded my expectations by a very long shot, so I I am going extra long on the next cycle. We are going to see more nation-states adopt and it is going to rip up. This is the way we conquer the stars.

Pump And Dump Suspicions
 
This comes after a string of controversies. Mayweather has been entangled in lawsuits and settlements for failing to disclose payments to promote unregistered cryptocurrency ventures.

The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) endorsed asset manager One Asset Management (ONEAM) to introduce a Bitcoin ETF, according to the Bangkok Post. The ONE Bitcoin ETF Fund is scheduled to be distributed between May 31 and June 6
Under the Thai SEC&#x27;s rules, the ETF will be limited to wealthy and institutional investors. This follows the regulator amending local guidelines in April to permit restricted Bitcoin ETFs targeting professional investors.
ONEAM will invest the fund in 11 major global Bitcoin funds to ensure adequate liquidity and security. The company said the ETF provides exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated framework, addressing risks like theft that come with direct ownership.
While ONEAM obtained approval, fellow Thai firm MFC Asset Management still awaits regulatory clearance for its own planned Bitcoin ETF product. Both will be private offerings for qualified investors only.
Thailand follows the trail blazed by the US SEC, which approved several Bitcoin ETFs this January, sparking surging interest. Other jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong, Australia, and the UK, have since followed suit in issuing spot Bitcoin ETFs or similar products.
The launches provide easy, regulated exposure to Bitcoin&#x27;s price movements without the need to handle Bitcoin directly. This better accommodates professional investors and institutions
By approving a Bitcoin ETF, Thailand&#x27;s regulators acknowledge the growing demand from local institutions to add Bitcoin allocations. The move could enable broader mainstream adoption once public offerings become available.</span>

                              <span>In a recent interview with The Defiant, David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer at Ripple, shed light on the security mechanisms of the XRP Ledger and the theoretical attack strategies it could face. Schwartz explained that unlike Proof-of-Work systems like Bitcoin, the XRP Ledger relies on a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism called the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RCPΑ) for security.
 
How The XRP Ledger Could Theoretically Be Attacked
 
Here’s how Schwartz describes it: “The only problem you can’t fix [with every node enforcing every rule] is the double spend problem […] the only way that you could sort of attack the XRP Ledger was to stop the global ordering from working and that would just cause the whole the whole network to halt.”

                              <span>On the surface, institutional adoption of digital assets is  
thriving. The fact that multiple major firms like HSBC and BlackRock are  
beginning to offer tokenized products is a testament. One recent projection  
even suggested that by 2030 the tokenized asset market could go as high as $16.1  
trillion. 
Institutional participation has long been viewed as a  
necessary step for a larger mainstream adoption of digital assets, so the  
market is excited to welcome these new products. While this all sounds  
overwhelmingly positive, there is unfortunately still a significant hurdle that  
will need to be addressed before we see any broader acceptance and usage of digital assets:  
siloed liquidity.
