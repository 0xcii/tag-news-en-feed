Dai Sharks &amp; Whales Have Bought 6.4% Of The Supply In Last Six Weeks
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the holdings of Dai whales and sharks had plunged to a bottom last month. The relevant indicator here is the “DAI Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the percentage of the total circulating supply of the stablecoin that each market wallet group is holding.
 
Addresses are divided into these wallet groups based on the number of coins they have in their balances. For example, the 100 to 1,000 coins cohort includes all addresses holding at least 100 and 1,000 tokens of the stablecoin.

                              <span>In an announcement made on April 24, Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange with the largest trade volume, unveiled its latest staking product, wrapped beacon eth (WBETH). This new addition to Binance’s staking solutions is built on the Ethereum network, joining the ranks of other competing liquid staking products such as Lido, Coinbase, Rocket Pool, and Frax.
 
WBETH Emerges as Binance’s New Solution to Ethereum-Based Staking
 
Liquid staking products based on Ethereum have been gaining popularity over the past two years. According to defillama.com metrics, as of this writing, there are over 8.2 million ether worth $15.49 billion locked into liquid staking derivatives. A staggering 74.22% of these ether assets are held by Lido Finance, the current leader in this space.
 
Coinbase’s wrapped ether product comes in second with $2.19 billion locked, followed by Rocket Pool with $983.26 million, Frax with $297.09 million, and Stakewise with $163.98 million. Binance has revealed that it has created two contracts for its new WBETH token, one for the Binance Smart Chain and one for Ethereum. The token will be available for trading on Binance from Thursday, with BUSD, ETH, and USDT trading pairs.
 
 
Starting on April 27, 2023, users will be able to create WBETH by depositing 1 ether, and vice versa. “Each WBETH token will accrue ETH Staking rewards daily, in accordance with the daily APR on ETH Staking,” states Binance. Additionally, to “support the daily updates of the BETH/WBETH conversion rate, the ‘Wrap’ and ‘Unwrap’ functions will be temporarily paused each day” at a designated time.
 
What do you think the future holds for liquid staking products, and how will the launch of WBETH impact the competitive landscape? Share your thoughts about this subject in the comments section below.</span>

Unit of account is the thing that measures the value of goods and services. It&#x27;s an essential function for something to be [or become?] money. In simple terms, it is a standard measure of value, a common scaling system through which the value of products can be calculated and compared.
Countries typically have distinct units of account, identified as the national or regional currency, such as the euro (EUR) or the British pound (GBP). At the same time, internationally, the U.S. dollar (USD) is the unit of account that is mainly used for global invoicing and setting prices internationally. 
Unit of account is one of money’s three universally agreed functions of money that Bitcoin Magazine is reviewing; the other two are store of value and medium of exchange.

According to a recent analysis by Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, BTC must double in value every four years or sustain extremely high fees to maintain its current level of security. 
 
 
Is Bitcoin’s Security Linked To Its Price?
 
In Bons’ analysis, he highlights that Bitcoin’s security model is based on its mining network, which requires a constant flow of new miners to maintain its security. However, suppose the price of Bitcoin continues to rise at its current pace. In that case, it will eventually reach a point where the cost of mining will become too high, leading to a decline in the number of miners and a subsequent decreas…</span>

Correlations Between Crypto And Fiat Currency
 
Correlation is commonly found to some degree across almost all assets. It is rare that two assets show no correlation, and instead tend to exhibit strong and weak, positive and negative correlations.
 
Technical analysts or investors look at asset correlations for diversification purposes, and to reduce risk in a portfolio. For example, a crypto-heavy portfolio wouldn’t benefit much from adding tech stocks due to a strong correlation. It could even incre…</span>

Introduction
Money is something that most of us take for granted, as we use it daily to buy goods and services. We constantly transact in money, think in money and strive to earn more of it. However, few genuinely understand what money is, and even those who do often perceive it in very different ways. 
Some say that money is a form of energy that can be transformed and exchanged. Others see it as a technological tool that facilitates trade and commerce. Still others argue that money is a social construct shaped and governed by cultural norms and values. All these views can be correct since the concept of money is much deeper than the way it is c…</span>

Unit of account is the thing that measures the value of goods and services. It&#x27;s an essential function for something to be [or become?] money. In simple terms, it is a standard measure of value, a common scaling system through which the value of products can be calculated and compared.
Countries typically have distinct units of account, identified as the national or regional currency, such as the euro (EUR) or the British pound (GBP). At the same time, internationally, the U.S. dollar (USD) is the unit of account that is mainly used for global invoicing and setting prices internationally. 
Unit of account is one of money’s three universally agreed functions of money that Bitcoin Magazine is reviewing; the other two are store of value and medium of exchange.

The concept of a “store of value” refers to goods that are capable of retaining or increasing their worth over time rather than declining in value. This term is used to describe a mechanism that enables individuals to preserve their wealth without experiencing any loss in value over time. 
It is one of the three functions of money that Bitcoin Magazine is exploring; the other two are medium of exchange and unit of account.
What is a Store of Value
A store of value is an asset, a currency or a commodity that can be trusted to hold its value over time; ideally, it doesn’t bear much risk. Traditionally, people who are less tolerant to risk will invest in a store of value with an enduring lifespan, a stable demand and low volatility.

As society’s structure and organization became more complex over time, the need for an evolving monetary system arose from the limitations of barter. Barter is not suitable as a means to exchange goods and services in an economic system larger than a tribe or family; barter was unsuitable for expanding societies that needed a more efficient method to exchange goods and services. 
Hence, about 2,600 years ago, a new and more sophisticated medium of exchange emerged in Lydia — a region recognized as modern Turkey — and materialized with stamped coins to face the challenges of barter and facilitate trade.
A medium of exchange is an intermediary item that is widely accepted to facilitate the trade of goods and services between two parties. It is one of money’s three universa…</span>

                              <span>Litecoin rose marginally higher to start the week, despite cryptocurrency markets mostly trading lower on Monday. The global crypto market cap is down 0.15% at the time of writing, as volatility remains high. Chainlink also moved higher in today’s session.
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) bounced from a key point of support to start the week, as the token rallied, despite Monday’s crypto red wave.
 
Following a low of $84.92 on Sunday, LTC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $88.89 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of this move, litecoin moved further away from its price floor at $86.00, and is now trading at its highest point since last Friday.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has now risen to a point of resistance at 45.00, leading to LTC giving up earlier gains.
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.33, with litecoin trading at $88.11.
 
Should price strength move beyond the 45.00 mark, there is a good chance that LTC will be back above $90.00.
 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) was also in the green in today’s session, and the token rose by as much as 2%.
 
LINK/USD climbed to a peak of $7.25 to start the week, following a low of $6.92 on Sunday.
 
Today’s rebound sees LINK move away from the three-and-a-half-week low registered over the weekend.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this coincides with the RSI bouncing from a floor of its own at the 44.00 mark.
 
Currently price strength is tracking at 45.09, with a resistance point at 47.00 a potential target for bulls.
 
Should it hit this mark, then it is likely that LINK will move above $7.30.

                              <span>Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he&#x27;s living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. &quot;I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re capitalist or you&#x27;re a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We&#x27;ve passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,&quot; he said. &quot;And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that&#x27;s outside of the traditional banking system.&quot;</span>

And yet &quot;The Mooch&quot; tells Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott &quot;I&#x27;m more bullish now than I have ever been&quot; on crypto as an investment case.
