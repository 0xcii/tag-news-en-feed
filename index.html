                              <span>Binance Connect, the regulated buy-and-sell crypto arm of Binance exchange, is set to shut down on August 16. 
 
This announcement comes after the decentralized exchange Biswap tweeted on the same day, revealing that Binance had made a challenging decision to disable its crypto arm on August 15 due to the closure of its supporting card payments service.
 
Biswap’s Tweet Reveals Binance Connect’s Closure
 
Initially launched as Bfinity on March 7, 2022, Binance Connect aimed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the world of cryptocurrencies. 
 
It served as a fiat-to-crypto payments provider, facilitating connections between crypto firms and the conventional financial system. The platform’s launch boasted support for an array of 50 cryptocurrencies and included popular fiat pay…</span>

                              <span>The Russian currency’s exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar recently dropped below RUB100 per greenback — its lowest in 16 months. Economists attribute the ruble’s latest plunge to the effectiveness of a price cap imposed on Russian oil by Western countries. Russ Mould said a strengthening U.S. dollar could be the reason why the Russian currency has struggled against the greenback in the past few months. 
 
Impact of the Oil Price Cap
 
On Aug. 14, the Russian currency’s exchange rate versus the greenback dropped to a new low of just over 100 rubles for every dollar. The currency’s latest plunge means the ruble has now depreciated by over 8% in the past month and by more than 20% since the start of 2023.

                              <span>The Las Vegas-based cryptocurrency custodian Prime Trust  
has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This marks the latest setback  
for the financial technology company, which has faced a series of challenges  
over the past year, from regulatory intervention to failed acquisition attempts.
The collapse of Prime  
Trust gained momentum when it was placed under receivership by the regulators  
in Nevada in June. This action was taken due to the company&#x27;s insolvency and  
inability to serve its customers. Additionally, a prospective acquisition by  
rival crypto custodian Bitgo fizzled out without explanation, causing concerns  
about the stability of the firm.
In June, Prime Trust&#x27;s subsidiary, Banq, filed for bankruptcy due to  
alleged mismanagement under former CEO Scott Purcell. …</span>

The decision to undertake this action is in line with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s endeavors to achieve stability for its own currency, which has been experiencing significant devaluation.
 
The official introduction of GBDT was first made in May, in response to the urgent demand for dependable and feasible market-driven resolutions.
 
 
The presence of an exceptionally high inflation rate of 175.8% in June served as an additional catalyst for increased demand from domestic investors.

According to finance Lawyer Scott Johnsson, August is a crucial month due to the “cycling” of law clerks in the District of Columbia (DC) courts, leading to the potential clearance of pending cases before the arrival of new personnel. 
 
While the decision could extend into September, Johnson suggests August remains a promising timeframe for a ruling.

Cryptocurrencies present “novel and complex risks” that are difficult to assess amid recent volatility, according to the report. Growth in crypto assets corresponded with more banks expressing interest in crypto activities last year. However, the sector then experienced a crash that exposed vulnerabilities. The FDIC is closely monitoring crypto activities at banks and said additional guidance is likely.

                              <span>Solana was one of Tuesday’s big gainers, rising to a multi-week high following a ‘death cross’ of moving averages. The move came despite the global market cap falling marginally lower as of the time of writing. Toncoin was another notable mover, rising for a sixth-straight day.
 
Solana (SOL)
 
Solana (SOL) surged higher on Tuesday, as sentiment in the token has remained largely bullish in recent days.
 
SOL/USD peaked at $25.24 during today’s session, which follows up from a low of $24.35 to start the week.
 
This climb saw solana trade at its highest point since July 29, when price reached a high of $25.39.
 
 
The move came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should upward momentum continue to intensify, the next target for traders will likely be around the $26.00 mark.
 
At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $24.82.
 
 
Toncoin (TON)
 
Toncoin (TON) was also in the green in today’s session, as the price climbed for a sixth-consecutive session.
 
Following a low of $1.42 to start the week, TON/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1.49 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s surge in price, toncoin moved to its strongest level since July 23, and closer to a ceiling of $1.50.
 
 
Similar to solana above, the rally came as the 10-day and 25-day moving averages neared an upwards cross.
 
One area of concern for bulls is the current reading of the RSI indicator, which is tracking at 66.91.
 
This is the highest area it has reached in the coin’s history, meaning it is greatly overbought, with bears potentially waiting to take advantage of this.

                              <span>The XRP ecosystem could face more vigorous opposition to its expansion from Stellar and native cryptocurrency XLM. The company recently acquired a minority stake in payment processor MoneyGram.
 
 
XRP v. Stellar: MoneyGram Could Tip Balance In Rivalry?
 
Denelle Dixon, CEO of the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), celebrated the deal in an official post. The partners have been collaborating since 2021 and, as a result, developed a crypto-backed product called MoneyGram Access.
 
Dixon emphasized the growth experienced by the XLM ecosystem since its partnership with MoneyGram, claiming that the Stellar network became the “leader of cash-to-crypto on and off-ramps” due to this product. The partners have focused on creating tools to provide people with access to the “digital economy.”

Bitcoin’s Consistent Four-Year Cycle
 
On August 14, Kelly laid out some analysis in a Twitter thread, pointing out the consistency of past crypto market cycles and how they could impact the market going forward. He says that contrary to public opinion, the crypto market is “quite cyclical” and consistent in certain metrics, which usually mark the beginning and end of a particular cycle. 
 
 
Kelly used Bitcoin as a point of reference to drive home his point of the crypto market being cyclical. He noted that Bitcoin typically follows a four-year c…</span>

                              <span>During the last crypto bull market, Dogecoin was a clear leader among altcoins and beat Bitcoin by miles in terms of return on investment (ROI).
 
Could this old dog be up to it’s same tricks? The meme coin is mere pennies away from triggering a “parabolic” signal that the last time around resulted in a 25,000% gain.
 
Why Dogecoin Could Become A Bull-Dog
 
Dogecoin has lost a large share of its former value alongside the rest of the crypto industry. This is common during a bear market. But during a bull market, the returns have historically been shocking.
 
 
The meme coin became the poster child of the last crypto bull run, famously being mentioned numerous times during Elon Musk’s Saturday Night Live performance.
 
That event was close to the peak of the previous cycle, and since then has been rolling over and playing dead. Soon, it could bite back. That is according to the Parabolic SAR indicator on the 1M DOGEUSD chart.
 

 
 
DOGE Closes In On Parabolic Buy Trigger
 
The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator created by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. who also created such tools as the Relative Strength Index, the Average Directional Index, and Average True Range.
 
The tool is used to tell a trader or investor that the trend has “stopped and reversed”. If DOGEUSD can tag the Parabolic SAR on the 1M timeframe, it could tell the market that the trend has officially changed.
 
 
The reason this is important, is because Dogecoin is typically an indication that altcoin season is approaching. When it begins to take off, so does the rest of the altcoin market. At least it has always historically done so.
 
A buy signal has only been triggered three times in the past, causing a 500%, 225%, and 25,000% rally, respectively. Will this signal once again prove as reliable as man’s best friend?

It still may take some time, though, before these changes take effect.</span>
