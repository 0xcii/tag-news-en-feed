Expert Takes A Risk To Get More Bitcoin
 
On Thursday, renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe announced to his X followers that he had sold all his Bitcoin holdings. He prefaced his explanation by stating that he had not lost his faith in BTC.
 
The expert explained he is not expecting the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to be “topped out for this cycle.” Additionally, he clarified that he has not become a “complete believer in gold.”
