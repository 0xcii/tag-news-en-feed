                              <span>Somebody, somewhere, at some point decided they would destroy the competition by creating a barrier to entry. They made the barrier high so they could feel safe. It is logical to put a fence around your property, and perfectly fine to do so. The problem is when you put a regulatory fence over something that means you are not allowing anyone else to have a property like this. Just to make the distinction clearer a fence around your house is creating a cost for other people to get in the yard. A license to be able to have a fence is creating a cost for anyone to protect their yard. The harder to attain and costlier the license is the more people can’t afford it. The more people who can’t afford it the bigger the divide between rich and poor. You can&#x27;t have a fence because you can&#x27;t have a li…</span>

Internet Computer Has Become Most Developed Crypto Project In Past Month
 
In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared the latest standings of cryptocurrency projects based on the criterion of “Development Activity.”
 
The Development Activity measures the total amount of work that the developers of any cryptocurrency project have delivered on its public GitHub repositories.
 
 
One way to gauge this work is through the number of “commits” on the repository. A commit is a record of any change made on the repository. However, this method has a problem, and it’s the fact that commits are inheritable.
 
This means that if a project is forked (t…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin (BTC) is back in the spotlight, with a surge in investor activity and contract holdings fueling more than 20% price jump this week.

                              <span>Cboe Australia has listed new exchange-traded funds  
(ETFs) from iShares by BlackRock. This step marks BlackRock as the first asset  
manager to list its iShares ETFs on each of Cboe&#x27;s listing exchanges worldwide.
Dave Howson, the Executive Vice President and Global  
President at Cboe Global Markets, mentioned: &quot;This latest listing of  
iShares ETFs on Cboe Australia is a major milestone and a significant step  
forward to deliver on Cboe&#x27;s global listings vision. Cboe is the only exchange network in the world  
facilitating access to global capital and secondary liquidity by offering an  
efficient path for asset managers to list across our five listings  
exchanges.&quot;
iShares ETFs Enter the Australian Market
The newly listed iShares ETFs on Cboe Australia  
include iShares MSCI World ex Australia Momentum ETF (Ticker: IMTM), iShares  
MSCI World ex Australia Quality ETF (Ticker: IQLT), and iShares MSCI World ex  
Australia Value ETF (Ticker: IVLU). Cboe is one of the largest ETF listing venues in the  
US, hosting over 680 ETF listings. According to the press release, Cboe  
Australia accounts for up to 40% of the Australian ETF daily trading volume.
Last month, The US Securities and Exchange  
Commission approved the applications of 11 firms for spot Bitcoin ETFs. These  
ETFs were authorized to be listed on US stock exchanges, including NYSE Arca,  
Nasdaq, and Cboe BZX, and are available for trading starting today.
The approved issuers are ARK 21Shares, Invesco  
Galaxy, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, Valkyrie, BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise,  
Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton.
Bitcoin ETFs Poised for Record Inflows
Analysts speculate significant inflows into Bitcoin  
ETFs, estimating between $50 billion and $100 billion in the first year.  
However, the SEC’s Chief Gary Gensler clarified the approval’s scope,  
emphasizing it does not reflect approval for crypto asset securities.
