                              <span>In  
a court filing on Wednesday (yesterday), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)  
firmly opposed the renewed motion for temporary release filed by Sam  
Bankman-Fried, the Founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, ahead of his  
upcoming trial. 
The  
motion sought his temporary release with stringent restrictions.  However, it has been met with strong  
resistance from prosecutors. They contend that the arguments put forth by  
Bankman-Fried&#x27;s legal team lack specificity and fail to establish a compelling  
case for his release.
DOJ&#x27;s  
Opposition to Bankman-Fried&#x27;s Release

                              <span>Layer one (L1) and layer two (L2) blockchains offer different approaches to scaling distributed ledger networks. While developers of L1 blockchains focus on improving the base protocol, L2 programmers have moved transactions off-chain to enable faster and cheaper transactions. 
 
What Are Layer One Blockchains?
 
Layer one or L1 refers to a base blockchain protocol like Bitcoin or Ethereum. These networks operate on a decentralized ledger secured by proof-of-work (PoW) mining or proof-of-stake (PoS) staking. L1 chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum offer unparalleled security. However, during peak times, both of these chains grapple with sluggish transaction speeds and steep fees.

                              <span>Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has announced its full exit from Russia with a sale to a newly launched exchange. This move comes as a response to the firm’s compliance issues related to Western sanctions imposed on Russia.
 
In August, Binance began considering an exit from the Russian markets following reports of its continued support for sanctioned Russian banks on its platform. While the crypto exchange has since severed ties with these financial institutions, it seems set on also permanently discontinuing its operations in Russia.

In

Public Bitcoin Miners Control Around 28% Of The Total Hashrate
 
In a new post on X, Bloomberg Intelligence market analyst Jamie Coutts discussed how the mining industry has evolved. The first thing Coutts talked about is what the share of the global Bitcoin hashrate is looking like between private and public miners.
 
The “hashrate” here refers to the total computing power the miners have connected to the Bitcoin network. This metric can serve as a measure of the security of the blockchain, as more mining rigs being attached means a 51% hack is harder to perform.
 
The security also depends, however, on how decentralized the hashrate is. A large am…</span>

                              <span>Researchers at the Federal Reserve have delved into the world of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) on blockchain technology. This exploration sheds light on the transformative power of tokenization, emphasizing its potential benefits and financial stability implications.
 
Tokenization, as elucidated in the paper, is the process of creating digital avatars, known as crypto tokens, for non-crypto assets, often referred to as reference assets. This innovative approach intertwines the digital asset ecosystem with the traditional financial system, creating a complex web of connections. 
 
As RWAs, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities, undergo tokenization, they gain the ability to harness blockchain’s advantages.

Lawmakers Want Spot Bitcoin ETFs Approved
 
U.S. Representatives Mike Flood (R-NE), Tom Emmer (R-MN), Wiley Nickel (D-NC), and Ritchie Torres (D-NY) sent a letter to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler on Tuesday urging the regulator to immediately approve applications for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

                              <span>Rich Rhines, original Core DAO contributor and former Coinbase engineer, discusses how the narrative around Bitcoin is shifting in 2023. While Bitcoin remains digital gold, new layer 2 solutionsare emerging to unlock more utility and value from the huge amounts of capital stored in Bitcoin. He says these innovations can benefit Bitcoin holders while keeping Bitcoin maximalists happy by building outside the base layer. André Beganski interviewed him at Messari Mainnet 2023.</span>
