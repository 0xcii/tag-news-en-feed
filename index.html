                              <span>Chainlink rose to a six-month high in today’s session, as crypto markets moved back into the green on Tuesday. Markets were buoyant following stronger than expected Chinese growth data, with the global market cap up 0.45% as of writing. Litecoin also climbed, hitting a two-month high in the process.
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) rose to a six-month high on Tuesday, as the global crypto market cap rebounded from Monday’s decline.
 
LINK/USD rallied to an intraday high of $8.66 in today’s session, a day after trading at a low of $7.97.
 
Today’s surge in price saw chainlink climb to its highest point since November 8, when it traded at a peak of $9.48.
 
 
Looking at the chart, one of the catalysts of today’s surge in price was a breakout that occurred on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, price strength has moved beyond a ceiling at the 68.00 mark, and is now tracking at 72.93
 
This is the strongest reading for the index since February 2021, which could mean that a reversal is on the cards.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
In addition to LINK, litecoin (LTC) also moved to a multi-month high during today’s session.
 
Following a low of $98.11 to start the week, LTC/USD rose above the $100.00 mark, hitting a peak of $102.67 in the process.
 
As a result of Tuesday’s surge in price, litecoin has hit its highest point since February 16.
 
 
The move came as LTC saw a breakout of a long-term ceiling at the $101.00 level, before colliding with a wall on the RSI indicator.
 
This aforementioned ceiling was at the 67.00 mark, and as of writing the index is marginally higher, at a reading of 67.17.
 
Should a full breakout occur, the next high that litecoin bulls must overcome is a ceiling at $105.70.

                              <span>Blockchain-based  
remittance services are a rapidly growing sector of the fintech industry,  
providing a new and innovative way to transmit money across borders swiftly,  
securely, and affordably. 
We will look at  
the possibilities of blockchain-based remittance services, the benefits they  
provide, and the obstacles they confront in this article.
What are  
blockchain-enabled remittance services?
Blockchain-based  
remittance services employ blockchain technology to ease cross-border money  
transfers. Rather than depending on traditional middlemen like banks and money  
transfer operators, blockchain-based remittance services use distributed ledger  
technology to enable individuals and organizations to send and receive money  
directly, without the need for intermediaries.

Naturally, this has had some effect on the market, dragging some other coins down with it. But metrics point to this drawdown being only a temporary setback for BTC. According to volatility, there are still some ways to go before the rally comes to an end.
 
Bitcoin Volatility Drops To January 2023 Levels
 
According to new data shared by on-chain analytics platform Santiment, Bitcoin’s volatility could point to a continuation of the bull rally. The digital asset’s volatility has been on a decline and has now returned to levels not seen since January 2023.
 
 
The majority of this decline in volatility can be seen after BTC first cleared the $25,000 resistance…</span>

                              <span>Anthony Scaramucci of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital got burned by Sam Bankman-Fried: he co-hosted SALT conferences with FTX and sold a 30% stake in SkyBridge to FTX Ventures. And yet &quot;The Mooch&quot; tells Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott &quot;I&#x27;m more bullish now than I have ever been&quot; on crypto as an investment case. He discusses his frustration with SBF, how wrong he thinks politicians like Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler are about crypto and how to regulate it, what he sees happening next with adoption, and talks about Trump.

                              <span>Gnosis first launched in 2015 as a decentralized prediction market built on Ethereum. Now it&#x27;s a DAO, a multi-sig wallet, a staking chain, and a vibrant community with its own GNO governance token. Co-founder and COO Friederike Ernst talked to Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott about the careful evolution of Gnosis, decentralization impostors, account abstraction, DeFi UX failures, why Ethereum is the &quot;Manhattan of crypto,&quot; and much more.
