                              <span>This week marked a significant advancement in Argentina’s embrace of blockchain technology as the Cardano Foundation partnered with Entre Ríos, a central province.
 
 
Argentina’s Crypto Potential
 
This strategic alliance marks a turning point for both parties, with Cardano aiming to tango its way into the vibrant Argentine crypto scene and Entre Ríos seeking a skilled partner to lead the way in blockchain adoption.
 
The official signing ceremony between Governor Rogelio Frigerio and Cardano’s Rafael Fraga caused a stir in the South American nation. Although the details of the partnership are undisclosed, there is widespread speculation.

Commission’s (SEC) role in policing the “Wild West” crypto industry as a “cop

Although anecdotal, what has since followed is a series of  
high-profile civil lawsuits against some of the sector’s largest players. Yet,  
a statement like this would only ring true if the SEC actually adhered to its  
very own rule-driven standard. 
SEC&#x27;s Priorities in Crypto Regulation
It’s no secret that the SEC, which aims to bring  
crypto under tighter government scrutiny as its primary overseer, is continuing  
to drag its feet by refusing to tailor rules to clarify oversight of the  
multi-trillion dollar crypto sector. But it isn’t just that the SEC has

                              <span>Binance has reportedly reintroduced Mastercard  
payments for crypto purchases. This step arrived after Mastercard paused this  
service in August 2023 due to legal challenges facing Binance in the US. Both the  
US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading  
Commission had filed multiple charges against the exchange, leading to a  
temporary cessation of these services.
Enhanced Security Measures 
Binance&#x27;s spokesperson told Coindesk that this  
decision was reached after a review of the controls and processes that Binance has implemented. Mastercard now allows Binance-related purchases on  
its network and plans to support other services, such as withdrawals, later.

BREAKING: ROBINHOOD BUYS #BITCOIN AND CRYPTO EXCHANGE BITSTAMP FOR $200 MILLION. pic.twitter.com/Q9LfBDw3Di
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 6, 2024
  
  
  
Founded in 2011, Bitstamp is one of the world&#x27;s oldest and most established crypto exchanges. It operates across Europe, Asia and the U.S., with over 50 licenses globally. The acquisition will bring Bitstamp&#x27;s institutional and retail customers under Robinhood&#x27;s umbrella.
Robinhood aims to leverage Bitstamp&#x27;s reputation for resilience and trust to bolster its own Bitcoin and crypto offerings. Bitstamp underwent over a decade of market cycles and maintained high-security standards. 
The purchase comes as Robinhood faces scrutiny from the SEC over its crypto division. However, Bitcoin and crypto remain a key driver of growth, with transaction revenue from crypto trading jumping 40% last year. Acquiring an established platform like Bitstamp could significantly expand Robinhood&#x27;s global reach.
Robinhood general manager Johann Kerbrat said the deal is a &quot;major step in growing our crypto business&quot; and will help Robinhood &quot;expand our footprint outside of the U.S. and welcome institutional customers.&quot; Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev says, &quot;We believe crypto will fundamentally reorganize the financial system.&quot;
Robinhood has already been offering Bitcoin and crypto trading services in the EU. But buying Bitstamp provides a ready-made base of customers and regulatory licensing across multiple jurisdictions.  As Bitcoin demand increases, the acquisition positions Robinhood to capture growing trading volumes.</span>
