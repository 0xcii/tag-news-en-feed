                              <span>This year, there has been a flurry of news reports and opinion editorials discussing an alleged de-dollarization trend amid a wave of disclosures associated with the BRICS bloc. In a recent article, the American political scientist and author Ian Bremmer insisted that claims of the U.S. dollar dying are overblown. In addition to Bremmer’s comments, economist Paul Krugman also asserted in a recent op-ed that the greenback isn’t going away anytime soon and called some of the speculators “‘Weimarists,’ people who are always predicting hyperinflation.”

Bitcoin Correlation To Gold Has Increased During The Past Year
 
According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the correlation between the two assets remained high during the recent US banking crisis. The “BTC correlation to Gold” indicates how closely Bitcoin is following the movements taking place in the price of one troy ounce of Gold.
 
When the value of this metric is negative, it means BTC is currently responding to movements in the price of Gold by traveling in the opposite direction. On the other hand, positive values of the indicator imply the two assets are moving in a similar trajectory right now.
 
Naturally, when the correlation is zero, …</span>

Tether Supply Is Nearing Its All-Time High
 
The stablecoin market has recently contracted and is currently hovering around $131.94 billion. The decrease in the stablecoin market can be attributed to several dollar-pegged coins that have reduced their token supplies. In the last month, usd coin (USDC) has decreased its supply by 12.6%, while binance usd (BUSD) has seen an 18.9% reduction in supply.

                              <span>After the report revealing that the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex had received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the securities regulator charged Bittrex and the company’s CEO on April 17 for “operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency.”
 
Following the Wells Notice, SEC Charges Bittrex for Violating Federal Laws
 
On Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged another cryptocurrency exchange, accusing the trading platform Bittrex of operating “an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.” Since 2014, Bittrex allegedly sold crypto assets that were “offered and sold as securities.” The SEC’s complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.

                              <span>Dogecoin rose by over 6% to start the week, as prices moved back towards a key resistance level. The meme coin moved higher for a fifth straight session, despite the cryptocurrency market falling by 1.54% as of writing. Avalanche also climbed, hitting a two-month high.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) rose by as much as 6% on Monday, as prices surged for a fifth consecutive session.
 
Following a low of $0.08858 on Sunday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.0946 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move saw dogecoin close in on a key resistance at the $0.0960 level, which was last hit on April 5.
 
 
Looking at the chart, one of the catalysts of today’s surge in price was a breakout that occurred on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, price strength has moved beyond a ceiling at the 61.00 mark, and is tracking at 62.87
 
An upcoming wall at 65.00 could be a hurdle for current bulls. However, should they overcome this, there is a good chance that DOGE moves back above $0.1000.
 
 
Avalanche (AVAX)
 
In addition to DOGE, avalanche (AVAX), was another notable gainer in the market to start the week.
 
AVAX/USD climbed to an intraday high of $21.011 on Monday, following a low of $19.04 during Sunday’s session.
 
As a result of Monday’s surge in price, avalanche has hit its highest point since Feb. 22.
 
 
This has resulted in the token briefly breaking out of a point of resistance at $20.90, however gains have since slipped.
 
It appears that momentum was caught short following the RSI colliding with its own ceiling at the 73.00 mark.
 
Although the index is now tracking at 73.17, earlier bulls seem to be more tentative, and are moving to secure gains.

The general counsel disclosed that Bittrex had started winding down its operations before the SEC sent a potential enforcement notice.

                              <span>Anthony Scaramucci of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital got burned by Sam Bankman-Fried: he co-hosted SALT conferences with FTX and sold a 30% stake in SkyBridge to FTX Ventures. And yet &quot;The Mooch&quot; tells Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott &quot;I&#x27;m more bullish now than I have ever been&quot; on crypto as an investment case. He discusses his frustration with SBF, how wrong he thinks politicians like Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler are about crypto and how to regulate it, what he sees happening next with adoption, and talks about Trump.

                              <span>Gnosis first launched in 2015 as a decentralized prediction market built on Ethereum. Now it&#x27;s a DAO, a multi-sig wallet, a staking chain, and a vibrant community with its own GNO governance token. Co-founder and COO Friederike Ernst talked to Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott about the careful evolution of Gnosis, decentralization impostors, account abstraction, DeFi UX failures, why Ethereum is the &quot;Manhattan of crypto,&quot; and much more.
