                              <span>The crypto and legacy markets could see a spike in volatility in a few hours. Jeremy Siegel, the Wharton School of Business Professor, told CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell: Overtime’ that “it will be a disaster” if the United States Federal Reserve (FED) increases rates by 50 basis points on February 1, 2023.

Meanwhile, several alternative cryptocurrencies saw even greater increases in value, with metaverse tokens like Decentraland’s MANA and The Sandbox’s SAND rising 92-150% against the greenback.
 
Metaverse Crypto Assets Outshine Bitcoin and Ethereum
 
Metaverse crypto assets have outperformed both bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH), the leading crypto asset and top smart contract token, respectively. In the past month, Decentraland’s MANA token has been the top performer, rising 150% against the U.S. dollar. Over the last two weeks, MANA climbed 7.3%, and in the past seven days, it rose 2.9%.

However, over the long term, there is still a bullish case for the digital asset but how high the price will go remains anyone’s best guess. An analyst has taken to Twitter to share their own forecast, which paints one of the most bullish cases for bitcoin over time.
 
PlanB Says Bitcoin At $1 Million Is Possible
 
In a YouTube video, the pseudonymous analyst known as PlanB on Twitter laid out a chart that showed an expected growth pattern for bitcoin. The chart follows through to the very beginning of bitcoin, presumably to show this growth pattern in action over the years.

Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 just closed its January monthly session outside of a key trend line the entire world of finance has been watching. Here is why a possible breakout in the stock market could propel BTC higher along with it in a perfect storm scenario. 
 
The Stock Market Closes Monthly Candle Above Key Trend Line
 
The S&amp;P 500 index is often considered the best measure of the overall health of the US stock market, and indirectly, the economy. It’s used as a benchmark to compare the alpha and beta of other assets and individual stocks.
