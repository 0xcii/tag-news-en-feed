Market observers have been keeping a close eye on First Republic Bank since the collapse of three major banks in March.

                              <span>Neutronpay aims to empower the second largest population of El Salvadorans outside of the country using Lightning and Bitcoin.
Neutronpay, a Bitcoin and Lightning company, has announced the release of its mobile app in Canada. According to the company, Neutronpay aims to provide a fast, secure and low-cost solution for cross-border remittances using Lightning.
The app allows users to send and receive Bitcoin and Lightning payments, and it comes with a range of features, including a Lightning Network explorer, QR code scanner and a customizable address book. It also allows users to exchange Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies, such as Canadian dollars, and vice versa.
In addition to the release of the app, Neutronpay has announced its first Canadian partnership with DitoBanx, a Bitcoin and Lightning app in El Salvador. The partnership aims to facilitate cross-border remittances between El Salvadorian-Canadians and their families in El Salvador. Neutronpay&#x27;s Lightning-powered app will allow Canadians to send and receive money to and from DitoBanx instantly and transparently.
&quot;Cross-border remittances over Lightning are truly keeping more money in the hands of the people who need it the most, all while happening instantly and transparently,&quot; Neutronpay said in a statement. &quot;We look forward to supporting El Salvadorians and each new community which comes next for us, so stay tuned!&quot;
El Salvador was the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, and it has been attracting attention from bitcoin companies around the world. According to Neutronpay, Canada has the second largest El Salvadorian community outside the country making it a perfect market for this technology.</span>

However, the staking landscape is still evolving, with several exciting innovations on the horizon that are set to further shake up the ETH staking economy.
 
The “crypto explorers” known as Bankless have identified Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) as an innovative protocol that aims to improve the accessibility and ease of staking on blockchain networks. DVT’s approach involves introducing a “multi-sig for validators,” which splits control over a single private key among a group of validators.

Bitcoin Trading Volume Recently Crossed Above The $30 Billion Mark
 
According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, altcoins are now drawing lower and lower interest as BTC’s price dominance strengthens. The “trading volume” is an indicator that measures the daily total amount of a cryptocurrency (in USD) that’s being transacted on the blockchain.
 
When the value of this metric is high, it means a large number of tokens of the asset in question are being moved around on the network right now. Such a trend suggests that traders are active in the market currently.

David Bailey, the CEO of BTC Inc, the parent company of Bitcoin Magazine, tweeted that the world’s first Bitcoin-only magazine received harsh reaction from the Bitcoin community.

Now Marco Santori, the company&#x27;s chief legal officer, says the exchange is eager to move on from it. That means reckoning with a really challenging regulatory environment and growing its customer base overseas. And as Santori quips: &quot;Kraken&#x27;s master account application has not yet been rejected.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Arthur Hayes says the speed at which projects like Terra grow and implode is a feature of the crypto industry, not a bug. He founded crypto exchange Bitmex in 2014 and then became the original crypto bad boy. In 2021 the DOJ charged him in with violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act for not implementing an anti-money laundering program at Bitmex. He plead guilty and was sentenced to two years probation and six months of home detention. In fact, he was still sporting an ankle bracelet on a recent cover of New York Magazine. Now he&#x27;s living in Singapore, offering up his views on the crypto industry with long form, meme-filled essays, and still thinks the crypto industry will save investors from what he calls a broken banking system. &quot;I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re capitalist or you&#x27;re a communist. Everybody put on a lot of debt. We&#x27;ve passed the point where that debt is becoming useful,&quot; he said. &quot;And therefore everyone is going to take an L unless they get some crypto or some gold—some hard asset that&#x27;s outside of the traditional banking system.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Anthony Scaramucci of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital got burned by Sam Bankman-Fried: he co-hosted SALT conferences with FTX and sold a 30% stake in SkyBridge to FTX Ventures. And yet &quot;The Mooch&quot; tells Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott &quot;I&#x27;m more bullish now than I have ever been&quot; on crypto as an investment case. He discusses his frustration with SBF, how wrong he thinks politicians like Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler are about crypto and how to regulate it, what he sees happening next with adoption, and talks about Trump.

                              <span>Toronto-based Bitcoin mining company Hut 8 recently announced a merger with U.S. Bitcoin Corp that will take it into Texas, Nebraska, and New York. Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton joined Dan Roberts and Stacy Elliott to talk expanding into the U.S., dealing with regulatory pushback post-FTX, why Texas is such a hotspot, and where she&#x27;d like to expand globally down the road (the climates may surprise you).

                              <span>Move over, DeFi—ReFi is coming? Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki has stepped away from DeFi grant-giving machine Gitcoin as it fully decentralizes and is now focused on regenerative finance (huh?) and ReFi incubator Supermodular. He aims to &quot;regenerate the regenerators.&quot; He explained it all to Dan Roberts and Liam Kelly, and also talks DAO structure, crypto factions, NFT use cases, his book &quot;Greenpilled,&quot; and much more.
