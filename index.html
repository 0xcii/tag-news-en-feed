                              <span>Singapore’s Monetary Authority has introduced amendments to the Payment Services Act, signaling a widening regulatory framework. These changes, which will take effect in phases from April 4, mark a significant shift in the landscape for companies operating in the crypto sector.
 
Guidelines For Consumer Protection
 
The amendments encompass a range of measures, covering custodial services for digital payment tokens (DPTs), transmission facilitation of DPTs, and cross-border money transfers.
 
 
Notably, the regulations extend to activities involving funds from outside Singapore. This expanded regulatory purview “empowers” the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to impose stringent requirements on DPT service providers, signaling a “proactive” approach to mitigating risks associated with …</span>

Why Now Might Be A Good Time To Invest In DOGE
 
In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Kaleo reminded the crypto community of how the world’s richest man and X owner, Elon Musk, changed the X logo to Dogecoin a couple of days after April 1 last year. The crypto expert further revealed that he had already positioned himself just in case Musk does it again this time around. 
 
Last year, Dogecoin’S price jumped by over 30% after Musk replaced X’s logo with the Shiba Inu dog (which happens to be DOGE’s logo). As such, Kaleo expects the meme coin to enjoy a…</span>

                              <span>Today, the US government sent a transaction that appears to indicate it may be on the verge of liquidating the remaining Bitcoin it confiscated from the online marketplace Silk Road.
According to on-chain data, a 0.001 BTC test transaction, part of a larger stash of approximately 30,174 BTC worth $2 billion linked to the infamous Silk Road marketplace, were moved by the US government.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, received the transaction from these Silk Road-related funds. Arkham Intelligence first identified the origins of where the BTC was coming from, and the coins destination of Coinbase. It appears the purpose of this transaction is to sell the coins, as it has previously done in the past.
 
                         
                         
                         
                     
                    
Last March, the U.S. government sold off 10,000 bitcoin related to Silk Road, selling just over 9,861 BTC worth $216 million, according to a court filing.
As in this case, this event was proceeded by 3 on-chain transactions, which were sent a few weeks prior to the sale&#x27;s disclosure in a court filing.
The U.S. Marshals Service is one of the largest Bitcoin sellers to date. According to data from researcher Jameson Lopp, the US Marshals have helped the US government sell 195,000 BTC.

                              <span>This Tuesday, the price of gold ascended to a new zenith, reaching $2,266.85, marking the third consecutive day of record highs. The precious metal started the day trading just under $2,250, but surged to set a new record, slightly above its previous day’s peak. Amidst this surge in gold prices, the cryptocurrency sector, particularly Bitcoin, is perceived to be on the brink of significant gains.

                              <span>I recently spoke with Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes, a peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin trading platform with numerous other functionalities, about how NoOnes is empowering its users, what it&#x27;s doing in response to the Nigerian government’s crackdown on Binance P2P and why P2P marketplaces play a crucial role in fulfilling the promise of bitcoin as a medium of exchange.
Youssef and the global team at NoOnes are on a mission to end financial apartheid and to unite the financially disenfranchised around the world. In the process, they’re taking on the old financial guard, driven by the belief that when people can trade freely with one another using bitcoin, the oppressive powers that be will lose their leverage over those living in developing economies.

                              <span>Despite Bitcoin&#x27;s decline, several alternative cryptocurrencies remain robust. Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness a $94 million outflow, although outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may decelerate. Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase&#x27;s premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin&#x27;s all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance. Solana&#x27;s (SOL) decentralized exchange (DEX) achieves a monthly volume of $50 billion, with revenue soaring 30-fold. OKX announces support for a new Solana token standard. Despite expectations, Layer 2 activity remains sluggish post-Dencun, according to Vitalik Buterin.</span>
