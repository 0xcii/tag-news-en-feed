                              <span>Even before Michael Saylor dropped the now meme-immortalized phrase “there is no second best”, Bitcoin maximalism has been a staple of the crypto space. So much so that “crypto” itself became an unworthy moniker to describe Bitcoin’s weight and significance.
For Bitcoin maximalists, Bitcoin is Bitcoin and cryptos are altcoins, if not shitcoins. Now that Bitcoin is heading for a bull run, boosted by the 4th halving hype and Bitcoin ETF approvals, Saylor’s MicroStrategy is already over $1.2 billion in unrealized profit territory.
The Bitcoin meme maker himself wasted no time in visualizing the payoff from his Bitcoin maximalism strategy.



With such results on the table, it’s time to examine Bitcoin maximalism more closely. Is the simple holding of BTC tokens more sophisticated than all the…</span>

Cardano To Flip Dogecoin And XRP
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, self-acclaimed ‘Cardano OG’ Chris O opined that ADA will flip tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP on its way to becoming the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap. According to him, ADA and Solana (SOL) will battle it out for this position as he foresees them flipping each other “back and forth.”

Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin’s current price is situated within a 24-hour range of $43,412 to $44,243, reflecting short-term volatility. The leading crypto asset has seen a 1.1% decrease over the past day, though it maintains a 2% increase over the week and an impressive 19.6% rise over the last 30 days.
