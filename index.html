As September 2024 unfolds, analysts are asking whether INJ will hit the $20 mark before Mpeppe (MPEPE) reaches $1. Both projects have seen considerable growth, but their paths to success are very different. Let’s dive into what makes Injective Protocol (INJ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) top contenders and explore their price potential for the near future.
 
Injective Protocol (INJ): Can It Break Through $20?

Popular analyst Michaël van de Poppe says Bitcoin could very well follow the trajectory of the historic rise of gold during the Great Depression.

Van de Poppe is among the analysts taking the view that Bitcoin will have its ultimate rally very soon and that it will be sustained via rate cuts and quantitative easing policies.

                              <span>There’s no denying that Bitcoin has significantly underperformed in recent months and has fallen short of the high expectations held by many bullish market participants. This underperformance has been especially evident in the past few weeks, where the cryptocurrency has faced considerable declines. Bitcoin’s price has dropped by 8.2% over the last seven days and 5.4% in the past 20 days, pushing more short-term holders into losses.
 
 
A well-known crypto analyst, Caleb Franzen, recently weighed in on the situation through a post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). According to Franzen, Bitcoin’s underwhelming performance has now positioned the cryptocurrency at a crucial position that would determine a bull market continuation.

This rebound highlights the potential for Solana to overcome recent struggles and push through key resistance levels. With the bulls gaining traction, the spotlight now shifts to whether this upward momentum can be sustained or if the bears will regain control and hinder the rally.
 
As SOL approaches this key level, this article aims to determine whether Solana can maintain its upward trajectory and overcome existing bearish pressures, or if the resistance will prove too strong, affecting its short-term outlook. We will analyze …</span>
