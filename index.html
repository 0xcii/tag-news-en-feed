                              <span>Chase UK’s recent decision to ban cryptocurrency transactions for its customers has sparked debate within the crypto community. While the bank cites concerns over scams and fraud as the rationale behind this move, critics argue that it contradicts the United Kingdom’s crypto policy objectives. 
 
Jesper Johansen, founder and CEO of crypto service provider Northstake, expressed his reservations about the decision in an interview with Blockworks, stating:
 
 
“Firstly, this ban contradicts the UK government’s stated policy goal to develop favorable conditions and a supportive environment for crypto businesses to set up and scale their services.”  
 
This divergence from national policy goals raises questions about the bank’s commitment to the country’s evolving crypto landscape.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas provided significant insight on this development in a tweet: “UPDATE: Hearing the SEC wants to accelerate the launch of Ether futures ETFs (bc they want it off their plate bf shutdown) so they’ve asked the filers to update their docs by Fri pm (no small task to jam into 48hrs, esp for indie issuers), so they can go eff Mon and trade Tue.”

The  
motion sought his temporary release with stringent restrictions.  However, it has been met with strong

Layer one or L1 refers to a base blockchain protocol like Bitcoin or Ethereum. These networks operate on a decentralized ledger secured by proof-of-work (PoW) mining or proof-of-stake (PoS) staking.

Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, one of the US&#x27; largest  
cryptocurrency exchanges, has criticized JPMorgan Chase UK&#x27;s recent decision to  
prohibit its customers in the UK from engaging in crypto-related  
transactions. Armstrong  
expressed his discontent on X (formerly Twitter) on September 26, labeling  
Chase Bank&#x27;s actions as &quot;totally inappropriate&quot;.
Armstrong  
Requests Chase UK&#x27;s Crypto Transaction Ban Investigation
In  
his tweet, Armstrong called upon UK crypto holders to consider closing their  
accounts with Chase UK if they continue to face such restrictions. He also  
urged UK officials, including Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Economic  
Secretary, Andrew Griffith, to investigate whether Chase UK&#x27;s actions align with

High-Risk Crypto Investment Goes Sour

Public Bitcoin Miners Control Around 28% Of The Total Hashrate
 
In a new post on X, Bloomberg Intelligence market analyst Jamie Coutts discussed how the mining industry has evolved. The first thing Coutts talked about is what the share of the global Bitcoin hashrate is looking like between private and public miners.
 
The “hashrate” here refers to the total computing power the miners have connected to the Bitcoin network. This metric can serve as a measure of the security of the blockchain, as more mining rigs being attached means a 51% hack is harder to perform.
 
The security also depends, however, on how decentralized the hashrate is. A large am…</span>

                              <span>Researchers at the Federal Reserve have delved into the world of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) on blockchain technology. This exploration sheds light on the transformative power of tokenization, emphasizing its potential benefits and financial stability implications.
 
Tokenization, as elucidated in the paper, is the process of creating digital avatars, known as crypto tokens, for non-crypto assets, often referred to as reference assets. This innovative approach intertwines the digital asset ecosystem with the traditional financial system, creating a complex web of connections. 
 
As RWAs, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities, undergo tokenization, they gain the ability to harness blockchain’s advantages.

                              <span>Four U.S. lawmakers have called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to immediately approve spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Following the Court of Appeals’ decision, there is no reason to continue to deny such applications under inconsistent and discriminatory standards … We urge you to approve the listing of spot bitcoin ETPs immediately,” the lawmakers told SEC Chair Gary Gensler.
 
Lawmakers Want Spot Bitcoin ETFs Approved
 
U.S. Representatives Mike Flood (R-NE), Tom Emmer (R-MN), Wiley Nickel (D-NC), and Ritchie Torres (D-NY) sent a letter to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler on Tuesday urging the regulator to immediately approve applications for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
