Mark Cuban Shares What Crypto Needs to Go Mainstream
 
Billionaire Mark Cuban, a Shark Tank star and the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, answered a number of questions from users on social media platform X during an episode of Wired’s “Tech Support,” broadcast on Wednesday.

This time, it was in front of the jury as Bankman-Fried had a lot to say about what went on at his former company, including revelations about how he planned to sell the exchange to its one-time competition, Binance.
 
Why Sam Bankman-Fried Wanted To Sell FTX To Binance
 
According to a live report by CNN, SBF stated that he saw himself selling FTX to Binance when he and co-founder Gary Wang first started it in 2019 due to the number of crypto exchanges that already existed and the fact that he had no idea of how the company was going to get customers.

Will Dogecoin Be Implemented In X’s Financial Structure? 
 
So far, Musk hasn’t stated if there is any plan to incorporate cryptocurrencies into X’s payment service and, most especially, Dogecoin. However, with the X owner’s fondness and alleged investment in the token’s ecosystem, there is the possibility that this could happen once the platform’s payment service launches at the end of next year.

                              <span>Despite facing a formidable difficulty level of 61.03 trillion, bitcoin miners are gearing up for their fourth consecutive difficulty rise set to unfold on October 30, 2023. Surprisingly, the previous three surges in difficulty failed to thwart Bitcoin’s hashrate, which soared to an all-time peak on October 12, 2023. What’s even more interesting is that the recent epochs for block times have consistently outpaced the traditional ten-minute average.
 
Bitcoin’s Hashrate Skyrockets to Historic High Despite Rising Difficulty, 4th Increase Expected in 2 Days
 
The surge in bitcoin’s (BTC) value has translated into burgeoning profits for miners, with the world’s largest mining pools continuing to commit substantial hashpower to the network. On October 12, based on a simple moving seven-day aver…</span>

                              <span>Chainlink moved towards an 18-month high to start the weekend, following a second day of bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency rose by as much as 7% in today’s session, despite the global market cap mostly consolidating on Saturday. Cardano also rallied, nearing a multi-month high of its own. 
 
Chainlink (LINK)
 
Chainlink (LINK) made considerable gains to start the weekend, as the token rose by as much as 7% in the day.
 
LINK/USD peaked at a high of $11.59 earlier in today’s session, which comes a day after price fell to a low of $10.80.
 
Today’s gains pushed price closer to a recent 18-month high of $11.78, which was hit during the week.
 
 
The latest bullish push in LINK comes as the relative strength index (RSI) continued to trend upward, and it now sits at 81.68.
 
A ceiling is fast approaching at the 83.00 mark, and should bulls fail to break out of this level, there will likely be a reversal in price.
 
 
Cardano (ADA)
 
Cardano (ADA) was another notable mover on Saturday, climbing closer to a recent nine-week high.
 
Following a low of $0.284 on Friday, ADA/USD raced to a peak at $0.2973 earlier in today’s session.
 
As a result of the surge, cardano edged closer to its highest level since mid-August, when price traded over $0.30.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the 14-day RSI is now tracking at a reading above 77.00, which could prompt some bears to begin entering the market.
 
As a result, a handful of bulls have begun to secure gains, leading to ADA now trading marginally below today’s peak.

                              <span>Hester Peirce of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a dissenting remark on the regulator’s approach to the crypto sector. In a statement on October 27, the crypto-friendly commissioner lambasted the SEC’s enforcement actions against the LRBY blockchain company. 
 
Back in March 2021, the US securities regulator filed a lawsuit against LBRY, claiming the sale of the firm’s LBC token represented an offering of unregistered securities. In November 2022, the US Court finally ruled in favor of the SEC, subjecting LBRY to penalties imposed by the Commission.
 
Although LBRY did file an intent to appeal this ruling, it appears the blockchain firm will not be following through with this action, having recently announced plans to wind down its operations due to financia…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin started the weekend tracking around the $34,000 level, as prices rebounded following a two-day winless run. The cryptocurrency has begun to consolidate in recent days, following strong gains earlier in the week. Ethereum moved back closer to the $1,800 level.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin rose back above the $34,000 level on Saturday, which comes following recent price consolidation.
 
After hitting a low of $33,416.89 on Friday, BTC/USD rallied to an intraday high of $34,201.77 to start the day.
 
The move saw bitcoin snap a two-day losing streak, which came after the cryptocurrency was significantly overbought.
 
 
Despite the uncertainty of the past few days, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) remains in this territory.
 
As of writing, the index is tracking at 81.21, which comes as bulls implemented an interim floor at the 80.00 mark.
 
If this level holds throughout the weekend, bulls may make another run towards the $35,000 level.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) rebounded from Friday’s drop, making a run back towards the $1,800 level to start the weekend.
 
ETH/USD peaked at $1,796.57 on Saturday, which comes after the price fell to a low of $1,751.44 less than 24 hours ago.
 
This climb means that the world’s second largest cryptocurrency has traded higher for nine of the last ten sessions.
 
 
Looking at the chart, this latest rally comes as the 10-day (red) moving average continues its uptrend versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Additionally, the RSI found a floor at 68.00, using it as a springboard to a current reading of 69.94.
 
Bulls will likely make further runs towards $1,800, despite overall price strength being overbought.
