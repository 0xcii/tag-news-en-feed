                              <span>Bitcoin U.S. spot ETFs saw a remarkable reversal this week, with a massive $418 million net inflow on Tuesday. This comes after the ETFs experienced 5 straight days of net outflows last week during Bitcoin&#x27;s dip below $60,000.

The turnaround signals renewed confidence among institutional investors, who have eagerly piled into Bitcoin ETFs since the first US ETF approval earlier this year. The SEC has now approved eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs after years of rejecting applications.
Fidelity&#x27;s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust ETF (FBTC) led Tuesday&#x27;s surge. It saw a staggering $279 million in inflows, the largest single-day gain since its launch. 
The influx starkly contrasts last week&#x27;s bearish sentiment, when over $200 million flowed out of Bitcoin ETFs as prices fluctuated amid a broader Bitcoin price dip.
Now, with Bitcoin stabilizing around $70,000, institutional interest is returning. While Grayscale&#x27;s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) continued bleeding assets, BlackRock&#x27;s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw $162 million added on Tuesday. The total assets under management across Bitcoin ETFs are nearly $59 billion. 
The sharp inflow reversal underscores Wall Street&#x27;s growing appetite for Bitcoin exposure via regulated investment vehicles. Bitcoin ETFs are passing their first real test in a volatile market environment.
If the adoption trend persists despite market swings, Bitcoin ETFs could cement their status as the preferred Bitcoin on-ramps for institutional dollars. Their growth and resilience reflect Bitcoin&#x27;s broadening mainstream acceptance.</span>

The court found against the crypto firm, supporting the SEC’s claims that the platform operated as an exchange, broker, and clearing agency. However, the court also sided with the US-based exchange on certain SEC claims regarding its wallet. As a result, the case will proceed, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing dispute.

Bitcoin As The Perfect Asset
 
In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Kiyosaki posed a series of questions about Bitcoin, accompanied by answers to each query. When he questioned his stance on BTC, the finance guru unequivocally declared himself a Bitcoin bull, affirming his admiration for the cryptocurrency. 
 
 
He characterized Bitcoin as the “perfect asset at the right time,” because of its high value and potential in today’s economic and financial landscape.

                              <span>Despite Bitcoin&#x27;s decline, several alternative cryptocurrencies remain robust. Fantom (FTM) emerges as the top-performing Layer 1 blockchain, while Coinbase introduces futures trading. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness a $94 million outflow, although outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) may decelerate. Approximately $1 billion worth of Bitcoin shorts face liquidation if prices reach $67.8k. Coinbase&#x27;s premium resurfaces, marking the first occurrence since Bitcoin&#x27;s all-time high. Bitcoin continues its streak with seven consecutive months of positive performance.
