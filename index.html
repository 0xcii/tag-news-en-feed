reportedly dismissed several applications by asset managers to launch  
spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). According to sources who shared  
information with the Wall Street Journal on Friday, the agency termed the  
applications as neither sufficiently clear nor comprehensive.
Specifically, the SEC  
commented about the applications filed by Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets on  
behalf of the asset managers, BlackRock and Fidelity, the sources familiar with the matter told the  
publication.

This was reflected in the network’s on-chain activity and gas fees. According to the quarterly report by blockchain analytics company IntoTheBlock, Ethereum recorded an 83% increase in network fees in the past three months.
 
 
Ethereum Network Fees Surge Due To Memecoin Frenzy
 
The network fee surge experienced by the Ethereum network has been linked to the rise of Ethereum-based memecoins in the Q2 of 2023. In the last few months, new memecoins, like APED, BOBO, PEPE, etc., have taken over the market, with some of these tokens recording huge gains.

                              <span>In today’s latest development, the United State Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) has deemed the recent spot Bitcoin ETF filings by various asset managers as “inadequate.”
 
According to a report by Wall Street Journal, the U.S. financial watchdog communicated this resolution to the Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options exchanges (Cboe), stating these fillings are not “sufficiently clear and comprehensive.” 
 
In this process, Nasdaq and Cboe represent the asset managers behind the ETF fillings, including BlackRock, Fidelity, ARK, etc.
 
To the SEC, the Bitcoin ETF applications should have included more information on their “surveillance-sharing agreements” and perhaps the spot Bitcoin exchanges that would be involved in those agreements.

The VLS solution, an open-source Rust library and reference implementation, separates a user&#x27;s private keys from their Lightning node, providing an extra layer of protection against potential compromises and theft of funds. According to the announcement, VLS offers a level of security unmatched by other solutions in the ecosystem.
&quot;We&#x27;re thrilled to announce the VLS beta release, a major step forward for Lightning network security, and we&#x27;re excited to share it with developers and companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem,&quot; stated the VLS team. They encouraged developers and companies to try out t…</span>

Revix Reserves Customer Asset Balance
 
According to a statement by Revix on its website, 24% of the total crypto asset balances held on the platform will now be rendered as reserved. This is the percentage of Revix’s crypto assets that are held with Haru.
 
 
This means that each customer on the platform will have almost one-fourth of their assets locked, making them untradeable and non-withdrawable. On the other hand, 100% of fiat cash balances are fully accessible to customers whenever needed.

He aims to “achieve tax code fairness” by “ensuring that the burden is shared by the wealthy, super-wealthy, and large corporations while safeguarding the middle class from any tax increases.”
 
Biden Wants to Eliminate Tax Loopholes for Crypto Traders
 
U.S. President Joe Biden talked about taxation for crypto traders during his economic policy speech dubbed “Bidenomics” in Chicago on Wednesday.
 
“Does anyone here think the federal tax system is fair? Raise your hand,” Biden said, adding:
 

No matter how much money you make. We’re going to make it fair by eliminating loopholes for crypto traders, hedge fund managers.

Citigroup has initiated discussions with various other custody providers. This move suggests that the banking giant is exploring alternative options for its custody services.
 
In May, the payment company announced its decision to purchase Metaco. The acquisition was announced while Ripple fought, and continues to fight, a legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is anticipated to have significant financial implications for the blockchain company.

                              <span>Over the past two weeks, bitcoin cash has experienced a significant surge, increasing 182% against the U.S. dollar and attracting more hashrate to its network. Approximately 22 bitcoin cash mining pools are now allocating SHA256 hashrate to the chain as BCH is currently 2.7% more lucrative to mine compared to BTC.
 
Bitcoin Cash Hashrate Sees Surge in Interest as Mining Profitability Outshines Bitcoin
 
In the last 24 hours, the crypto market has been quite unstable, particularly following the release of May’s personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which showed a 0.1% increase.
 
Although several major cryptocurrencies lost value in response to this news, bitcoin cash (BCH) remains up by over 20% in just one day and more than 100% in a week. Two-wee…</span>

Elon Musk vs. Mark Zuckerberg: Training Sessions And Venue Considerations
 
The series of events began over a week ago when Elon Musk took to Twitter, stating his willingness to engage in a ‘cage fight’ with Mark Zuckerberg.
 
In response, the CEO of Meta asked Musk to provide a location for the potential fight through a social media post. He humorously referred to his fighting strategy as ‘walrus-style,’ which involves lying on top of his opponent without taking any action.
 
Maye Musk, Elon’s mother, made efforts to prevent the fight, urging everyone to refrain from encouraging it. To her relief, Ms. Musk later tweeted that…</span>

                              <span>Introduction
Bitcoin miners collect and broadcast transactions in a block and verify their validity. Then they apply a cryptographic hash function of the previous block&#x27;s header to the new block. Finally, they try to solve the proof-of-work problem. Satoshi Nakamoto adopted a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to resolve the Byzantine Generals&#x27; Problem, establishing a transparent and objective protocol.
What Is Proof Of Work (PoW)?
Proof of work is literally proof that work has been done to validate the network’s transactions and generate new bitcoin. It is the consensus mechanism and algorithm that uses computing power to verify transactions and add them to the Bitcoin blockchain. Such a mechanism allows the Bitcoin network to be trusted and remain decentralized.
