                              <span>In a significant turn of events, a court in Montenegro has overturned the extradition order of Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, to the United States or South Korea. The Podgorica-based Appeals Court made the decision, which cited procedural irregularities and lack of clarity in its ruling. 
 
The court’s decision came in response to an appeal filed by Do Kwon’s defense, which resulted in the case being sent back to the Supreme Court for reconsideration.
 
Do Kwon’s Extradition In Limbo
 
The appellate court’s ruling adds new uncertainty to extraditing Do Kwon. As reported by Bitcoinist, authorities last week extended Do Kwon’s extradition detention until mid-February, giving them time to decide whether he should be extradited to the United States or South Korea.

Upholding PoW as the Chain’s Consensus
 
On Dec. 18, the Ethereum Proof of Work (ETHW) core development organization was dissolved to help the protocol achieve full autonomy. A statement released by an ETHW core team member said the decision, which allows ETHW to operate independently without the Core’s support, followed “in-depth discussions and [was] based on a majority consensus.”

Bitcoin 7-Day Average Mining Hashrate Has Just Set A New All-Time High
 
The “mining hashrate” refers to a metric that keeps track of the total computing power the miners have connected to the Bitcoin blockchain.
 
This indicator can correlate with the network’s security, as this combined computing power controls and manages the chain. If a malicious attacker intends to take over the network, they would have to gain control over most of the online mining rigs.
 
 
Thus, the more computing power connected to the network, the harder it is to perform such a 51% hack, so the tighter the security of Bitcoin. This is only, of course, given that the hashrate is sufficiently dece…</span>
