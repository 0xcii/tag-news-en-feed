                              <span>BTC needs to top $65.2k to put in a higher high. ETH ETFs see biggest outflow since July. ETH outperformance could be start of ‘alt season’. BlackRock gets 12hr BTC withdrawal from Coinbase. cbBTC only wrapped BTC to not show reserves. Telegram to share user data upon legal requests. EIGEN non-transferability to be removed Sep 30th. TIA announces $100m funding round. TIA deal was OTC token sale ‘done months ago’. Polymarket considers token, trying $50m raise. Maybe we will pay off debt with crypto: Trump. Harris unlikely to give full crypto policy pre-election. 13m Binance users’ data may have been leaked. Caroline Ellison likely won’t serve time in jail.</span>
