                              <span>The crypto world witnessed a significant chapter close on December 20, 2023, as the United States Court of Appeals finalized the forfeiture of 69,370 Bitcoin. This decision, stemming from the notorious Silk Road case, marks one of the most substantial forfeitures in the annals of digital currency.
 
Final Chapter In Silk Road Saga
 
Silk Road, a now-defunct dark web marketplace, became synonymous with BTC in its early days. Since the shutdown of this notorious dark web marketplace, US authorities have been actively working to confiscate the crypto assets amassed during its operation

EVM Chains Face Surge in Token Inscriptions
 

 
Over the past year, Bitcoin inscriptions have surged in popularity due to the advent of Ordinals, significantly impacting the Bitcoin blockchain. This controversial method has led to a sharp increase in transaction costs and a congested mempool, reigniting debates reminiscent of 2017’s block size war.
 

 
The phenomenon has now extended to Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. Despite the initial skepticism about introducing inscriptions on smart contract-capable blockchains, the demand for EVM inscriptions has been …</span>

SHIB Burn Rate Spike 420%
 
According to data from the Shibburn website, the SHIB burn rate saw another 421% increase in the last 24 hours. This spike comes as Shiba Inu community members change from their pattern from the previous day, which saw only a little over 1 million tokens burned.

                              <span>In a significant development, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) convened with applicants seeking approval for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) today, according to Eleanor Terrett and Charles Gasparino of FOX Business. 



Terrett revealed sources who attended the meeting said the SEC was &quot;making sure everyone is doing cash creates,&quot; and &quot;asked issuers to remove all hints of in-kind redemptions from their filings.&quot; This meeting assumes paramount importance amid the ongoing discussions and evaluations regarding the approval of such ETFs.
Terrett&#x27;s post hinted at the collaborative nature of the meeting, suggesting efforts to bring all stakeholders onto the same page regarding the nuances, prerequisites, and potential implications associated with their spot Bitcoin ETF applications. While details about all the specifics remain undisclosed, the meeting likely focused on addressing concerns, clarifying regulatory expectations, and streamlining the evaluation process for these ETF applications.
The SEC&#x27;s engagement with applicants reflects a commitment to comprehensively assess the viability and regulatory compliance of the proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs. The outcome of this meeting could significantly influence the trajectory of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, potentially paving the way for a more structured framework for institutional participation in this burgeoning industry. 
As market participants await further developments, this meeting stands as a crucial milestone in the potential approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Yesterday, FOX Business reported that BlackRock made receiving an approval for their spot Bitcoin ETF a &quot;key corporate priority,&quot; and that the ETFs will have a SEC decision by January 10.</span>

He contends that the halving is overly sensationalized and will only exert a temporary impact on bitcoin’s price.
 
Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Dismisses Bitcoin Halving Buzz as Exaggerated Frenzy
 

 
Back at the end of July 2023, Peter Brandt had already conveyed his viewpoint, dismissing the forthcoming bitcoin halving as an inconsequential “non-event.” He reiterated this perspective on Thursday, taking to X (previously known as Twitter) to issue a statement about the halving event.
