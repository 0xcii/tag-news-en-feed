                              <span>Bartek Kiepuszewski, the co-founder of L2Beat, a portal for tracking Ethereum layer-2 activities, is concerned about the security and consistency of existing off-chain scaling solutions, suggesting that without fraud-proofs, there is room for fraud and irregularities.
 
Focus On Optimism And Manta: What’s Going On?
 
Taking to X on December 20, Kiepuszewski observed that some layer-2 solutions, such as Manta and Optimism, rely on sequencers to post data to Ethereum. However, without fraud-proofs, there is no way to verify that the data published by the Sequencer on the Ethereum mainnet is accurate or complete. 
 
In the co-founder’s view, whenever a sequencer posts the batch of transactions on the main net, there is no layer-1 state or event change. Per Kiepuszewski ‘s assessment, this is …</span>

This pro-XRP legal expert, however, thinks otherwise as he provides a different perspective on XRP’s relatively tepid movement. 
 
XRP Holders Need Deeper Conviction
 
In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bill Morgan said that convictions (likely in reference to XRP holders) need to be “deeper than a day, week, or month of price action.” He mentioned how he doesn’t read much into a month’s price action in the crypto market. 
 
 
Before then, the legal expert had highlighted how XRP’s price action hasn’t been great, as it is down over 2% over the last month. Although the 2% drop seems to be significant to Morgan, he was choosi…</span>

                              <span>The legal tussle surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the Former CEO of FTX, intensified after a federal judge denied his defense team&#x27;s  
plea for an extended sentencing process. This decision occurred amid the prospect  
of a looming second trial following SBF&#x27;s recent conviction on  
charges of fraud and conspiracy.
As initially reported by Coindesk, SBF&#x27;s  
defense team had sought an extension of four to six weeks for his sentencing. The team emphasized a potential second trial  
slated for March 11, which could impact the pending sentencing scheduled for  
March 28.

Cardano Founder Celebrates Full Blocks
 
For the longest time, the Cardano network has been referred to as a zombie chain due to it not seeing as many transactions as other networks in the same category. However, as the price of its native token, ADA, has been on the rise, so has the network usage.
 
 
Recently, the community has gone from being worried about not enough activity to the blocks being produced on the blockchain being too full. This has been a welcome development for Hoskinson who took to X …</span>

&quot;What luck for rulers that men do not think.” 
– Adolf Hitler
Bitcoin will not kill the U.S. dollar. It will become the U.S. dollar, with all controls and restrictions that any CBDC issuer could dream of. “Impossible!” I hear you crying out, giggling to myself in the face of the utmost ignorance that seems to have accumulated quadratically with bitcoin’s price increase. “Bitcoin is freedom money!”
