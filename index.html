                              <span>Binance has set forth a plan to gradually discontinue  
BUSD stablecoin support across its platforms. The exchange has asked users who  
have been relying on BUSD for trading to convert their holdings into  
alternative assets by February of the upcoming year. However, Binance stated  
that BUSD will always maintain a 1:1 peg with the stablecoin.
As a more immediate  
change, Binance has scheduled the delisting of BUSD as a loanable asset, set to  
take effect on September 6. Moreover, withdrawals of Binance-peg BUSD tokens  
via BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, and Tron will cease on September 7.

high-profile collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022, the

trading platforms are safe. This led to the idea of creating Proof of Reserves  
(PoR) to show the current state of a given exchange&#x27;s capital reserves. OKX has  
just published its tenth consecutive PoR report, showing $10.4 billion in  
reserves in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT).

Bitcoin mining company, GoMining, has changed the way we think about bitcoin mining with their GoMining NFTs, giving holders a share of ownership in their mining operations. With over 2,000 BTC paid out over the last two years, GoMining is proving their thesis that bitcoin mining can be easy and accessible for everyone.
 
 
With brand ambassadors like Khabib Nurmagomedov and the project’s avid participation in the Bitcoin Mining Council, GoMining understands the importance of the cryptocurrency industry and the role of their bitcoin mining operations within it.

                              <span>Following the court’s ruling in favor of Grayscale against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), many have begun to wonder whether or not the SEC will succumb and approve Grayscale’s ETF application. However, this looks more likely as Bloomberg ETF analysts have increased the odds in favor of the asset manager. 
 
Odds For ETF Approval “75%”
 
Bloomberg Analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have increased the likelihood of Spot Bitcoin ETFs launching this year to 75%. Balchunas further stated that the odds would rise to 95% by the end of 2024 if these ETFs weren’t approved by then.

                              <span>The mystery surrounding the identity of the founder of Shiba Inu, known as “Ryoshi,” has taken another twist. A recent theory proposed by crypto researcher @BoringSleuth suggests that the elusive Ryoshi might be a combination of two individuals: Ryo Suzuki and Tsuyoshi Maruyama, both of whom have ties to the B2C2 Group.
 
“@BoringSleuth” tweeted, “Who do I believe Ryoshi, the anonymous Founder of $SHIB is? I believe it is a combo of 2 people: Ryo Suzuki &amp; Tsuyoshi Maruyama – Both Advisors to B2C2 Group.” The researcher further pointed out a curious coincidence: “Ryo Suzuki resigned as an advisor from B2C2 Group on 4/27/21, the exact same day Tsuyoshi Maruyama was appointed as an advisor for B2C2 Group.”
