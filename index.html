                              <span>A crypto analyst is bullish on Bitcoin (BTC), saying the market should expect a “supply shock of all supply shocks” when the network halves its miner rewards in roughly two months.
 
The Bitcoin Mining Event In Focus
 
Taking to X, Ted believes BTC prices will float higher after Bitcoin halves in April 2024. This event, set at the protocol level and scheduled roughly every four years (or after 240,000 blocks), will significantly reduce the amount of coins entering the market. 
 
 
The reduction in this supply will make BTC deflationary, possibly increasing prices. This outlook is considering the expected demand that will continue to rise in 2024.
 
The Bitcoin network disburses 6.25 BTC roughly every 10 minutes, meaning 900 BTC is mined daily. After halving, that number will drop to 450 BT…</span>

The regulatory watchdog has recently adopted new rules imposing registration requirements on “dealers” and “government securities dealers.” While the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, believes these measures protect investors and enhance market integrity, the move has faced staunch opposition from Commissioner Hester Pierce.
 
SEC Crypto Regulations May Stifle Competition? 
 
The newly adopted rules, Exchange Act Rules 3a5-4 and 3a44-2, refine the definition of “as a part of a regular business” in Sections 3(a)(5) and 3(a)(44) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Reason Why Bitcoin Halving Could End Up Being Significant
 
In a new post on X, CryptoQuant CEO and founder Ki Young Ju has talked about how the US-based Bitcoin miners are behaving so far in the leadup to the upcoming halving.
 
The “halving” here refers to a periodic event for Bitcoin in which the cryptocurrency’s block rewards are permanently slashed in half. This event occurs every four years; the next one is estimated to happen this April.
 
 
The block rewards are the BTC rewards miners receive as compensation for adding blocks to the network. Since these rewards usually make up for most of the miners’ revenue (as the transaction fees have…</span>
