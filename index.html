                              <span>Bitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, has gained immense popularity and attention over the years. Among the various factors that influence its price, Bitcoin halving events stand out as crucial moments in the cryptocurrency market. In this article, we’ll delve into why Bitcoin halving remains an important factor for BTC prices.
 
Bitcoin Halving: A Brief Overview
 
Bitcoin halving, often referred to as “the halvening,” is a scheduled event that occurs approximately every four years, or after every 210,000 blocks are mined. During a halving, the rewards that Bitcoin miners receive for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain are slashed in half. This means that the rate at which new bitcoins are created is reduced by 50%. Let’s explore why this event holds such si…</span>

                              <span>For the seventh week straight, non-fungible token (NFT) sales have slipped further. In the last week alone, NFT transactions totaled $66.11 million, marking an 11.65% decline from the previous week.
 
NFT Sales Bleed Out: The Unrelenting Seven-Week Descent
 

 
Although the broader crypto market experienced some uplift, NFT sales didn’t mirror this positive trend. Week after week for the past seven weeks, NFT sales volumes have been plunging.
 

 

 

 
Despite this week’s sales being 11.65% lower than the previous week, there’s a silver lining: the count of NFT purchasers surged by 17.77%, while the tally of sellers jumped by 15.82%. Data sourced from cryptoslam.io reveals that NFT sales on the Ethereum platform took the lion’s share, accounting for $38.10 million of the week’s turnover.

Crypto Cards — How They Work and What Are the Offerings in 2023
 

 
While not as immediate as most in the crypto community would like, crypto cards nevertheless present an opportunity to pay with decentralized digital money where merchants would only take dollars, euros or any of the other central bank currencies.
 

 
Just like bank cards, crypto cards can come in physical, or plastic, and virtual form. The latter can be used to make payments online while the former can be also swiped …</span>

The conflict escalated significantly as Gaza militants launched a surprise attack early Saturday, leading to at least 300 deaths and thousands of injuries in Israel, with ongoing fighting and rocket attacks in Tel Aviv and other areas, reports said.
