As part of the argument, the legal experts explained why SBF should not get the statutory maximum sentence of over 100 years.  
 
Bankman-Fried’s Lawyers Propose A Sentencing Limit Of 78 Months
 
According to the court filing, Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers requested that the defendant get a sentence between 63 months (5 years) and 78 months (six and a half years). Having been convicted of all seven charges leveled against him, the FTX founder faces up to 100 years in prison.
