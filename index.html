The decision to downsize came as a response to the challenges posed by the current bear market conditions, according to Emin Gün Sirer, the founder and CEO of Ava Labs.
 
In a post shared on the company’s official platform, Sirer acknowledged the difficulties of navigating the crypto space during a bear market but expressed optimism about the future.
 
 
Today we parted ways with some of our Ava Labs team members. We are no longer a 12 person startup, but we strive to capture the speed and energy of a small, nimble team.

Among the lessons I have learned through the years is that in order for a student to truly learn a new and challenging concept, they need to feel comfortable and have a voice in their learning process. Today, the most effective teachers are able to foster a dynamic community of engaged students that have agency in what and how they learn. But this wasn’t always so.
