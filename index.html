                              <span>PRESS RELEASE. The AX1 syndicate has conducted an in-depth review of the latest legal developments in the cryptocurrency space, with particular attention to the regulations, exchanges, and tax implications for both the European Union and the United States. This review aims to illuminate the evolving regulatory landscape and highlight key areas of concern and significance.
 
The study begins by examining the risks associated with using Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) for long-term storage of funds, particularly in light of recent CEX troubles. The review advises against using CEXs for long-term storage, even for the largest Tier 1 CEXs, due to potential risks such as regulatory enforcement, fraud, and liquidity issues​​.

According to an anonymous source cited by The Block, the filing could be submitted as early as Tuesday. This move would put Fidelity in the growing race to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF, which was triggered by BlackRock’s filing earlier this month. 
 
Bitcoin ETF Race Heats Up Amidst Growing Institutional Interest
 
Fidelity’s interest in a spot BTC ETF is not new. The company filed for a similar product, the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, in 2021, but it was denied by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early 2022.

He highlighted that MiCA brings uniformity to the registration and anti-money laundering requirements for crypto asset service providers across Europe, allowing for passporting of licenses throughout the region.

                              <span>Bitcoin cash rose to a one-year high on Tuesday, as traders continued to buy the token following last week’s EDX markets listing. The newly formed exchange, which is backed by the likes of Citadel, Sequoia Capital and Fidelity, listed the coin in its offering. Litecoin was another token added to the exchange. 
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) was one of Tuesday’s notable gainers, as the token surged to a one-year high.
 
Following a low of $197.30 to start the week, BCH/USD raced to an intraday peak of $236.64 earlier in the day.
 
As a result of today’s peak bitcoin cash moved nearly 18% higher, hitting its strongest point since May 2022 in the process.
 
 
From the chart, a breakout above a ceiling at 80.00 on the relative strength index (RSI) appears to be one of the reasons for today’s surge.
 
The index is now tracking at 82.55, which is deep in overbought territory, and comes as price rose by 120% in the last seven days.
 
Bears are likely already circling the token, anticipating a potential change in direction in the coming days.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) was another token to be listed on the EDX platform, however prices have not risen to the extent of BCH.
 
LTC/USD snapped a three-day losing streak on Tuesday, climbing to a peak of $89.90 earlier in the day.
 
This comes less than 24 hours after the cryptocurrency fell to a bottom at $86.42, despite a recent crossover of moving averages.
 
 
The 10-day (red) moving average rose above its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which typically signals bullish momentum.
 
In order for this to truly materialize, a breakout of an upcoming ceiling at 58.00 on the RSI will need to occur.
 
As of writing, price strength is now tracking at 56.30.

                              <span>Hong Kong has taken a significant step forward in embracing crypto as it re-opened its doors to the world of digital assets at the beginning of the month. In a bid to position itself as a leading global financial hub for innovative technologies, the Hong Kong government, in collaboration with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), has introduced a set of regulations to govern the trading and issuance of cryptocurrencies within its jurisdiction.
 
The re-opening of Hong Kong comes after a period of careful evaluation and consultation with industry experts, market participants, and other stakeholders. In addition to these overarching measures, the Hong Kong SFC has outlined specific requirements for retail-tradable tokens, aimed at safeguarding retail investors. One of the measures is …</span>

                              <span>After a three-day losing streak, bitcoin rebounded on Tuesday, ahead of the upcoming consumer confidence report in the United States. Price briefly fell below the $30,000 level earlier in the session, however bullish momentum has since returned. Ethereum rose above $1,900 for a short period.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded from recent losses on Tuesday, ahead of the upcoming U.S. consumer confidence report.
 
The Conference Board expects its index to rise to a reading of 104.0 in June, up from 102.3 the month prior.
 
BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $30,751.19 on Tuesday, following a low at $29,955.74 to start the week.
 
 
The move appears to have occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a support point at 68.00.
 
As of writing, the index now sits at a reading of 70.17, which is once again in overbought territory.
 
A barrier at 73.00 is now the next visible ceiling, and unless bulls break out of this point, BTC will likely move back below $30,000.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) briefly rose above the $1,900 level in today’s session, after falling towards a support level of $1,830 on Monday.
 
Following a low of $1,840.22 to start the week, ETH/USD jumped to a peak at $1,905.36 earlier in the day.
 
Momentum has since shifted, with the world’s second largest cryptocurrency once again falling below the $1,900 level.
 
 
At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,881.79, with the RSI marginally below a resistance level of 58.00.
 
Overall, momentum is bullish, following a recent crossover between the 10-day (red) moving average, and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.
 
Should this cross mature, there is a good chance that ETH will not only move above $1,900, but closer to $2,000.

                              <span>In the world of crypto, the influence of regulatory decisions is profound. Recently, emerging ecosystem tokens witnessed a considerable downturn in market capitalization. This shift comes in the wake of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings against prominent crypto exchange platforms, Binance and Coinbase.
 
These events have spurred concerns around the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and their classifications, notably affecting tokens such as Solana’s SOL and Polygon’s MATIC.

And with such little competition, Zerion&#x27;s head of growth Alexander Guy told Decrypt at NFC Lisbon it&#x27;s managed to rake in 150,000 funded wallets. Next step? Taking on MetaMask and contending as a browser-extension wallet.</span>
