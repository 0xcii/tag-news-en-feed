However, this slowdown isn’t completely limited to the price as the open interest-weighted funding rate of the meme con has seen a significant decline over the last day.
 
Dogecoin OI-Weighted Funding Rate Crashes 50%
 
Over the last few days, as the Dogecoin price rose, so did the OI-weighted funding rate. This is normal, given that the funding rate follows market sentiment. In times when crypto traders are very bullish, the funding rate rises as long traders have to pay short traders to keep their positions open. Then, when sentiment is skewed toward bearishness, funding rates tend to drop, and short traders pay long traders to keep their positions open.

Key departures include Michael Stanley, head of exchange-traded products, and Hetal Patel, head of business development, who have played pivotal roles in the ETF team.

Kwon&#x27;s Appeal Granted
Montenegrin news outlet Vijesti reported today  
(Friday) that the country’s court of appeals accepted the arguments from Kwon’s  
lawyers. This action canceled a previous decision by the High Court and sent  
the case back for retrial. This move represents the latest legal strategy by  
Kwon’s team to postpone his extradition to either the U.S. or South Korea,  
where he faces multiple criminal charges.
The initial ruling from the High Court in Podgorica on  
April 8, 2024, determined that Kwon, a South Korean national, could be

What’s inside this exclusive Fringe Finance interview with Michael Saylor:

What the effects of inflation will eventually be (“The Matrix”) and how globalist organizations like the World Economic Forum fit into the mix
The differences between bitching and moaning about flawed monetary policy versus offering up an actual solution
Whether he thinks the Fed will raise or lower rates next and why
Similarities and differences between bitcoin and fine art when talking about intrinsic value
If bitcoin, now embraced by Wall Street, needs to homogenize itself into the AML/KYC world of regulated banking and, if so, how that’ll happen
