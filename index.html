Cryptocurrency Project Floki Counters Hong Kong SFC’s Warning
 
In a detailed blog post dated Jan. 29, Floki, the team behind the dog-themed memecoin, addressed the recent warning from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) regarding its staking programs. The SFC had earlier labeled Floki and Tokenfi Staking Programs as “suspicious investment products,” cautioning users against their high promised returns.

However, the customers’ assets will be evaluated based on the fiat value of held crypto assets when the markets were in turmoil at the time of the exchange’s bankruptcy.
Full Repayment in the Plans
In the court hearing, FTX attorney Andy Dietderich from the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell said that the bankrupt exchange could “cautiously predict” a full repayment to the customers and creditors. However, it was “an objective” and not a “guarantee.”

Per a Reuters report, FTX had negotiated with potential bidders and investors for several months. Still, no party was willing to provide sufficient funding to rebuild the exchange.
 
FTX Shifts Focus To Asset Liquidation And Repayments
 
During the court hearing, Dietderich emphasized that the objective of returning funds to customers was not a guarantee but an “ambitious goal.” He acknowledged the “considerable” amount of work and associated risks involved but expressed confidence in the company’s strategy to achieve it.
