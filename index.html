One of the most important use cases of Bitcoin is, as many users of a certain privacy wallet would say, “To make the transactions they don’t want you to make.” Censorship resistance. Financial institutions, and indirectly governments through the coercive influence they exert over those institutions, hold a large degree of control over society and the economy by having the ability to deny people access to financial services and the ability to transact in markets they deem unacceptable. 
The cannabis industry has notoriously gotten the short end of the stick in that regard since it first became…</span>

Norway&#x27;s In-Depth Exploration
Norway, a pioneer in CBDC research, recently disclosed the outcomes of  
its fourth-phase experiments, signaling a cautious approach. While ruling out  
an immediate need for a retail CBDC, the focus shifts to a wholesale CBDC for  
interbank settlement of tokenized deposits. The fifth phase, set to conclude in  
late 2025, aims to equip the central bank with the necessary insights for a

Coinbase CEO Says Anti-Crypto Strategy Looks Bad

against the crypto lending platform Celsius for alleged failure in regulatory  
compliance. This notice, dated December 20, 2023, marks a critical turn in the  
company&#x27;s operations since it filed for bankruptcy last year. 
The FCA&#x27;s decision to cancel Celsius&#x27; approval stems  
from multiple significant reasons. According to the financial watchdog, Celsius  
failed to prudently conduct its affairs and maintain sound business practices.  
In a notice seen by Finance Magnates, the regulator has canceled the company&#x27;s  
permission to offer regulated services.
