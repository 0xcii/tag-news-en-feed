More Swapping Happening On Base And Optimism
 
Optimism and Base, two widely used layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, offer distinct advantages for traders. When swapping tokens on Uniswap, which is deployed on either of these platforms, traders benefit from considerably lower transaction fees.
 
 
Uniswap Labs reports a notable surge in swappers on Optimism and Base. Over the past year, the number has doubled from 124,970 in February 2023 to 310,050 in February 2024, indicating a rising interest in these layer-2 solutions.

The settlement, outlined in a recent court filing, marks a pivotal moment for BlockFi’s recovery efforts and its clients’ potential for maximum asset recovery.
 
 The successful resolution of these claims, alongside the defense against FTX’s avoidance claims and counterclaims, significantly impacts BlockFi’s customer recoveries and paves the way for the proposed reorganization plan.

                              <span>The Ripple Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty has drawn the crypto community’s attention to a court transcript highlighting the SEC’s (Securities and Exchange Commission) lack of clear-cut rules for companies it regulates. 
 
SEC’s Rules Are “So Vague And Loosey-goosey”
 
Alderoty shared a part of the Judge’s statement in the case of NCPPR v. SEC in an X (formerly Twitter) post. In that case, the Judge remarked that the SEC’s rules were “so vague and loosey-goosey that nobody knows whether they will be at risk from not asking.” The case involves NCPPR challenging a ruling by the SEC about a proposal not being included in Kroger’s proxy statement.

a Montenegrin court has ruled in favor of his extradition to his native South  
Korea. The decision marks the latest twist in the legal saga that unfolded  
following Kwon&#x27;s arrest in the Balkan nation last year.
Appeals Court Reverses Decision: Extradition to US  
Overturned
The High Court&#x27;s ruling came swiftly after an appeals court  
overturned its previous decision to extradite Kwon to the United States, where  
he faces charges related to a $40 billion crash of Terraform Labs&#x27;  
cryptocurrency. Kwon, aged 32, was apprehended on an international arrest  
warrant, following allegations of fraud and financial misconduct that  
devastated retail investors globally.
