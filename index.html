After Wang’s and Ellison’s surrender announcement, the public has been wondering where FTX’s director of engineering, Nishad Singh, is located and whether or not he has come forward yet.

However, the company continued to operate following a hack that would likely destroy some firms. Three months later, with the hack behind them, it seems Wintermute is back on track. However, not everyone believes that the company is completely out of the woods.
 
The Wintermute “Dumpster-Fire” 
 
A now-deleted Twitter thread has accused the Wintermute crypto trading firm of being a “dumpster fire.” The thread which claims to have information from current and ex-employees of the company as well as clients, claims that employees, especially the dev team, are unsatisfied with the company’s leadership and practices.

                              <span>Dogecoin rebounded from Wednesday’s decline, as the meme coin moved away from a key support level. Prices have been hovering close to a two-month low in recent days, with today’s surge bringing optimism to remaining bulls. Litecoin was also higher, as the token remained close to a one-week high.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) was in the green on Thursday, as the meme coin rebounded from recent lows.
 
Following a low of $0.07283 on Wednesday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.07736 earlier in today’s session.
 
The move comes as prices rallied, following a recent collision with a support point at the $0.0715 level.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, today’s move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) raced to a ceiling of 40.00.
 
Since this time, earlier gains have somewhat faded, with the meme coin trading at $0.07657 as of writing.
 
Should price strength manage to climb above this threshold, then DOGE could rally to a ceiling near $0.0800.
 
 
Litecoin (LTC)
 
Litecoin (LTC) also rose on Thursday, as the token continued to trade near a one-week high.
 
LTC/USD hit a peak of $66.51 earlier in today’s session, which comes less than a day after it was residing at a low of $65.09.
 
Today’s high is marginally below Tuesday’s top at $66.90, which was the highest point LTC had hit since last Friday.
 
 
Looking at the chart, the move comes despite the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) recently extending its downward cross with the 25-day (blue) MA.
 
As of writing, the RSI is tracking at 39.67, which is below the next visible resistance line at 45.00.
 
Bulls will likely target this point, which could see LTC climb above the $70.00 price point.
