                              <span>Recent data indicates that the market capitalization of the newly introduced stablecoin, first digital usd (FDUSD), is approaching the $1 billion threshold. This growth, a 253% increase in supply, has been recorded since August 4, 2023. Currently, the circulation of FDUSD tokens stands at 921 million. 
 
FDUSD’s Market Value Climbs Toward $1 Billion in Just 120 Days
 
Since its inception, FDUSD’s market value is on the brink of reaching $1 billion, having expanded its supply by a substantial 253% over the past 120 days from August 4, 2023. To date, the issuer of FDUSD has released three attestations, with the latest monthly report concluding in October. As of December 2, 2023, the circulation of first digital usd (FDUSD) stands at approximately 921,272,192 tokens.
 

 
Of the 921 million FDUSD in existence, a mere 224 holders possess the stablecoin, which has been transacted onchain only 1,471 times. Dominating the FDUSD landscape, Binance holds the top three addresses. The leading address alone accounts for a staggering 90.96% of FDUSD’s total supply. Following closely, Binance‘s second wallet contains 7.65% of the circulating FDUSD. The third wallet, also under Binance’s control, holds 0.81%.
 
Wintermute owns the fourth-largest FDUSD wallet, comprising 0.16% of the total supply, equivalent to 1,502,179 FDUSD. The fifth-largest wallet, whose owner remains unidentified, controls 999,998 FDUSD, or 0.10% of the supply. Collectively, the top 100 holders own 921,269,821.68 FDUSD tokens, nearly the entire circulation.
 
 
FDUSD’s rising prominence has positioned it as the sixth-largest USD-pegged token by market capitalization. While it closely trails behind BUSD, TUSD, and DAI, FDUSD is considerably smaller compared to giants like USDC and USDT. However, it boasts a larger supply than newer entrants like Paypal’s PYUSD, Tron’s USDD, and Gemini’s GUSD stablecoin.

Thus far, the initiative has proven successful, as the committee managed to increase the token’s value to the targeted range.

                              <span>XRP went through a consolidation period in the last week of November, but fundamentals and price action show the crypto is primed for a breakout.

                              <span>Between 2018 and 2023, 2,127 out of 2,817 Web3 games launched have either failed or are now inactive, an analysis by Coingecko has shown. The failure rate was the highest in 2019 (94.3%) and 2020 (94.4%) while in 2021, 339 out of 738 games failed, translating to a failure rate of 45.9%.
 
2020 Had the Highest Failure Rate
 
According to a new analysis by Coingecko, between 2018 and 2023, 2,127 out of 2,817 Web3 games launched have either failed or are now inactive. This means that for every four games launched, three have disappeared. Coingecko’s analysis also shows that during this period, the number of Web3 games that failed averaged 80.8% each year.
 

 
As per Coingecko’s data, the failure rate during the five years was the highest in 2019 (94.3%) and 2020 (94.4%). However, in 2021, the year of the last crypto bull run, 339 out of 738 games failed, translating to a failure rate of 45.9%.
 
 
In terms of the actual number of failed games, Coingecko’s analysis identifies 2022 as the year with the highest number of dead games with 742. The failure rate in that year stood at 107.1%, meaning it was the only year when the number of failed games was higher than those launched (693).
 
Meanwhile, the analysis shows that 2023 has the second-highest number of games launched (720), while 2020’s 86 game launches are the least in each of the five years reviewed. The year 2020 recorded the lowest number of dead games in any of the five years with 81.

                              <span>In the past six months, Bitcoin miners’ revenue has dropped by more than 30%, with November revenues approximately $270 million lower than October revenues. The drop in Bitcoin miners’ revenue is attributed to Bitcoin price volatility, increased competition, and higher electricity prices.
 
Gradual Decline in Miner Revenue
 

 
Bitcoin miners’ revenues have fallen by over 30% in the past six months, despite the gradual increase in the price of Bitcoin from its March 10 low of just over $20,000 to just over $38,000 on Dec. 1, 2023. According to banklesstimes.com data, miners’ November revenue of $615.1 million is approximately $300 million less than the January revenue.
 

 
Since reaching a high of $918.8 million in January, miners’ revenue has gradually declined in the months that followed. The month of October was the only time this trend was bucked, with miners securing the second-highest monthly earnings of 2023 at $885 million.
 

 
Commenting on the drop in miner revenue, Alice Leetham, an analyst at Banklesstimes, said:
 

This downturn has sparked widespread interest and concern within the cryptocurrency community, prompting us to delve into the factors contributing to this substantial decline.
 

 
In the Banklesstimes report, BTC price volatility is identified as one key factor explaining the drop in miners’ revenue. Meanwhile, an earlier report by Galaxy attributes the drop in revenue to what it described as the “incredible increase in network hashrate during the first half of the year.”
 
 

 
The increase in the hashrate is due to improved mining economics, the oversupply of second-hand ASICs in the secondary market, as well as the plugging in of new generation mining rigs. Other publications have attributed the revenue drop to the surge in energy prices.
