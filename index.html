Bitcoin’s Ordinals Pioneer Presents New ‘Runes’ Protocol
 
On Monday, Casey Rodarmor, creator of Bitcoin’s Ordinals, wrote a blog post introducing a new fungible technology protocol named Runes. In the post’s opening, Rodarmor expressed uncertainty, saying he’s “not sure creating a new fungible token protocol for Bitcoin is a good idea.” He added that fungible tokens are “99.9% scams and memes.” However, he recognizes they’re here to stay and that developing a r…</span>

A blockchain analytics firm, Cyvers, highlighted the attack on the HTX crypto exchange on September 24. According to the discovery, the hacker drained about 5,000 Ether (ETH) from one of the exchange’s hot wallets.

This forecast comes on the heels of recent developments that have bolstered the outlook for institutional adoption of Bitcoin by Wall Street firms.
AB estimates that the current size of the crypto fund management sector stands at approximately $45-50 billion. However, the firm&#x27;s analysts argue that this figure has the potential to swell to over $500 billion in assets by 2028. This transformation would signify a transition from what AB dubs a &quot;cottage industry&quot; to a fully formalized, regulated asset management sector.

                              <span>Bitcoin rebounded from a multi-week low on Tuesday, as markets awaited the latest consumer confidence report in the United States. The latest figures from the Conference Board are expected to show a slight decline, with a reading of 105.9 in September. This will be down from 106.1 the month prior.
 
Bitcoin
 
Bitcoin was back in the green on Tuesday, as its price rebounded from a multi-week low during yesterday’s session.
 
BTC/USD peaked at $26,421.51 earlier today, which comes following a low of $26,011.47 the day prior.
 
Monday’s low saw the world’s largest cryptocurrency trade at its weakest point since September 13, after dropping below $25,800.
 
 
From the chart, it appears that the rebound in price came as a result of the relative strength index (RSI), finding a floor of its own at 45.00.
 
As of writing this, price strength is now tracking at 45.84, with the next visible point of resistance at the 55.00 mark.
 
Should bulls reach the 55.00 level, there is a strong possibility that BTC will move close to the $27,000 zone.
 
 
Ethereum
 
Ethereum (ETH) also rose higher on Tuesday, after dropping to a key point of support to start the week.
 
Following a low of $1,565.03 on Monday, ethereum rallied to an intraday high at $1,598.10 less than 24 hours later.
 
Not only did ETH bulls reject a breakout below a floor at $1,565, but also used this as a point of reentry, buying the dip in price.
 
 
Similar to bitcoin above, the surge came as a floor of the RSI also held firm, acting as a springboard for traders.
 
ETH continues to hover below the $1,600 level, however, this could change following this afternoon’s consumer confidence report.

Renewed  
Plea: Bankman-Fried&#x27;s Latest Bid for Release
The journey towards this request began in August when  
Bankman-Fried&#x27;s release on bond was revoked. He was incarcerated after a judge  
ruled that he had likely attempted to tamper with witnesses. On September 12,  
his request to overturn this decision was denied, and the appeal to reverse the  
ruling was met with rejection on September 21.
In their latest plea, Bankman-Fried&#x27;s lawyers noted that the

                              <span>In a move  
to bolster retail investors&#x27; protection, Hong Kong&#x27;s Securities and Futures  
Commission (SFC) has announced a series of new measures this week. These  
initiatives come on the heels of the JPEX crypto exchange debacle, which  
exposed vulnerabilities in the city&#x27;s regulatory framework for virtual assets.  
The SFC&#x27;s new measures aim to enhance transparency, improve public awareness,  
and tighten regulations around crypto trading platforms.
JPEX Blowup Prompted  
Response from Hong Kong Regulator
In June  
2023, Hong Kong opened up to retail cryptocurrency trading, significantly  
relaxing the country&#x27;s existing rules. However, the number of licensed

                              <span>Renowned investor Jordan Belfort, famously known as the ‘Wolf of Wall Street,’ has undergone a significant change of heart. Several years ago, he vehemently labeled cryptocurrency as a scam, but today, he’s singing a different tune, especially when it comes to Bitcoin (BTC). 
 
In a conversation with Benzinga CEO Jason Raznick on “The Raz Report,” Belfort admitted his past skepticism while expressing newfound faith in the staying power of Bitcoin.
 
Belfort’s journey from a crypto skeptic to a Bitcoin believer underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. 
 
 
 
“I think I was right with most, the 99% of crypto,” he said. “I was wrong about Bitcoin, and Ethereum, and maybe one other,” he said.

                              <span>Dave Weisberger, Co-Founder and CEO of CoinRoutes, argued that excessive regulation in the U.S. threatens to undermine the country&#x27;s long-standing dominance in global financial markets. He warned that other countries are embracing blockchain and crypto to build more efficient digital markets, which could cause the US to lose its competitive edge and trillions in GDP. Weisberger said CoinRoutes is now focusing more on expanding internationally due to restrictive policies in the U.S. He was interviewed by André Beganski of Decrypt at Messari Mainnet 2023.</span>
