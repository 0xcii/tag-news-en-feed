                              <span>On July 12, 2023, onchain data shows the U.S. government transferred 9,800 bitcoins (BTC), worth just over $300 million. These bitcoins originally came from James Zhong’s Silk Road hack. In March, the Department of Justice also moved a similar amount of bitcoins associated with Silk Road.
 
Silk Road Bitcoin Stash Controlled by the Feds Moves, Funds Reportedly Sent to Coinbase
 
About 9,800 BTC from Silk Road was moved in two transactions on Wednesday, reportedly sent to wallets controlled by Coinbase. At the time of writing, the funds held by the U.S. government are worth $302 million, based on the day’s BTC exchange rates.
 
The bitcoins came from James Zhong, the convicted Silk Road hacker. At the time of his arrest, federal authorities seized about 51,351.89785803 bitcoins on three separate occasions, along with a collection of precious metals and $661,900 in cash.

Last March, the government sold 9,861 bitcoins for just over $200 million. The onchain activity four months prior was also detected by onchain observers and blockchain parsers. It’s speculated that all the BTC transferred from Zhong’s stash has been sold on Coinbase.
 
 
The selling through Coinbase is unusual as the U.S. government typically auctions off BTC with assistance from the U.S. Marshals. For example, bitcoins seized from Ross Ulbricht in the Silk Road case were auctioned, with investors like Tim Draper purchasing some of the coins. Only recently has the government started moving cryptocurrency to spot exchanges.

                              <span>The crypto industry is known for being subject to prey from various criminals, but new data suggests that the pattern may be shifting in a positive direction. Crypto criminals seem to have been taking it a bit easy so far this year. According to Chainalysis’ latest cryptocurrency crime report, crypto-related crimes have decreased 65% in the first half of 2023 compared to the same period last year. 
 
Report Shows Major Drop in Cryptocurrency Crimes
 
The significant drop in crypto crimes seems to be largely due to a major decline in scams and dark web market activity. From January through to the end of June, the total value of funds stolen from scam victims plummeted, resulting in a 65% decrease.

According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the BTC HODLers are filling up their wallets at a rate of 27,100 BTC per month. The “HODLers” here refer to the investors who tend to hold onto their Bitcoin for extended periods.
 
These investors generally don’t easily sell, regardless of whether there is FUD going on in the market or a sharp surge in the price is taking place. As such, they are sometimes called the diamond hands of the cryptocurrency.

The stablecoin BUSD’s supply has dropped below the 4 billion mark as the token’s number of coins in circulation has fallen 16.7% over the last month.
 
Dollar-Pegged Cryptos Feel the Pinch as Supplies Shrink Steadily
 
During the past ten days, the stablecoin economy shrank by $890 million after dropping from $128.21 billion to today’s $127.32 billion. Statistics show that the net value of the top dollar-pegged market capitalizations shrunk a great deal since the start of 2023.
 
On March 26, 2023, the stablecoin economy was worth $135.08 billion, which means $7.76 billion has been removed from the dollar-pegged token economy over t…</span>

This move brings the digital ruble, Russia’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) project, closer to actual implementation. However, the bill still requires approval from the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly, and the Federation Council, and must be signed into law by the President of Russia. If Vladimir Putin approves the law, it would make Russia the largest country to formally adopt a CBDC.

                              <span>Bitcoin cash rose by nearly 6% on Wednesday, following the release of the latest consumer price index (CPI) in the United States. Inflation fell by 1.0% from May, coming in at 3.0% last month. Polkadot also rose, extending its winning run for a third straight day.
 
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
Bitcoin cash (BCH) rose by as much as 6% earlier in today’s session. BCH/USD surged to a peak of $289.49 earlier in the day, which comes following Tuesday’s bottom at $271.44.
 
This rise in price has pushed the cryptocurrency towards a ceiling at $300.00, and closer to a recent 15-month high at $329.71.
 
 
From the chart, the move occurred after a marginal breakout of a ceiling at 68.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).
 
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 70.56, with the next visible point of resistance at 73.00.
 
Should this point be hit, there is a strong chance that BCH will be trading at or over $300.00.
 
 
Polkadot (DOT)
 
Polkadot (DOT) rose for a third consecutive day during Wednesday’s session, as price neared a one-week high.
 
After falling to a low at $5.13 on Tuesday, DOT/USD jumped to an intraday high of $5.30 earlier today.
 
This is the strongest level the token has hit since last Thursday, when it peaked at $5.37, marginally below a ceiling at $5.40.
 
 
Since today’s peak, earlier gains have somewhat slipped, as a result of the RSI colliding with a ceiling at 55.00.
 
Currently, price strength is at a reading of 54.55, with DOT now trading $0.05 lower than its previous high.
 
In the event this ceiling is broken, the next target for polkadot bulls will likely be $5.50.

Ark Invest Sells Coinbase Shares
 
On July 11, Bloomberg data showed that ARK Invest sold 135,152 COIN, equivalent to $12 million, out of their $1 billion COIN holdings, from ARK Innovation ETF. Notably, Ark Invest is liquidating a portion of its $1 billion COIN haul when share prices are rising, surging briefly to $90 on July 11. 
 
The Coinbase stock plunged by over 80% in 2022 after trading to as high as $430 in the last bull cycle of 2021 when crypto prices and stocks of crypto-related firms soared as valuations broke key resistance levels.

In categories such as DeFi, GameFi, and more, innovation never stopped, possibly making these unique assets especially noteworthy when growth fully resumes. Across DeFi in particular, we’ve seen early signs of a potential repeat of the 2020 DeFi summer, arriving slightly later than expected.
