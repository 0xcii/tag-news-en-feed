                              <span>Bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms has proposed to acquire  
its rival Bitfarms for US$2.30 per Bitfarms common share. This could reportedly make Riot the largest publicly listed Bitcoin miner globally.  
The deal offers Bitfarms&#x27; shareholders a substantial premium despite  
the volatile cryptocurrency market.
24% Premium
According to the press release, Riot&#x27;s proposal offers a 24% premium to Bitfarms&#x27;  
one-month volume-weighted average share price. With approximately US$950  
million in total equity value, the acquisition aims to enhance Bitfarms&#x27;

                              <span>Russian commodity firms have increasingly turned to cryptocurrency to circumvent financial hurdles posed by international sanctions.
 
With traditional banking channels facing challenges, companies are now leveraging stablecoins, notably Tether (USDT), to facilitate “seamless and swift cross-border transactions” with their Chinese counterparts, as reported by Bloomberg.
 
Major Russian metal producers have primarily adopted this transition, seeking efficient alternatives to conventional financial systems to maintain their trading operations.
