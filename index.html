                              <span>In June 2022, Grayscale sued the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after the regulator had once more declined to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot ETF. The case is expected to drag on into the second half of 2023 but Grayscale has come forward to reveal its plans if the court were to side with the SEC.
 
Still Not Backing Down, Plans To Appeal
 
Oral arguments in the Grayscale Investments lawsuit against the SEC have been scheduled for March 7, 2023. The date came earlier than expected but has been accelerated due to Genesis filing for bankruptcy and possible liquidity issues at parent company Digital Currency Group, the umbrella under which Grayscale operates.

                              <span>Dogecoin slipped to a five-day low on Wednesday, as the meme coin fell for a second straight session. The move saw prices drop by over 5%, edging closer towards a key price floor in the process. Polygon also extended recent declines, hitting its weakest point since January 19.
 
Dogecoin (DOGE)
 
Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped to a five-day low on Wednesday, as the global cryptocurrency market cap fell by as much as 3% today.
 
Following a low of $0.08919, DOGE/USD fell to an intraday low of $0.08245 earlier today.
 
The move saw dogecoin hit its lowest point since January 20, which is the last time prices were trading at a floor of $0.080.
 
 
As can be seen from the chart, the decline took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a support level of its own at 55.00.
 
In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has now shifted its direction, and appears to be on course for a downward trend.
 
Should this take place, and result in a crossover with the 25-day (blue) moving average, then DOGE will likely be trading below $0.080.
 
 
Polygon (MATIC)
 
Polygon (MATIC) was also in the red on hump day, with the token moving lower for a third consecutive day.
 
MATIC/USD fell below the $1.00 mark in today’s session, as prices slipped to a low of $0.938 earlier in the day.
 
Similar to dogecoin, today’s decline has pushed polygon to its weakest point since last Thursday, when prices were trading at a floor of $0.940.
 
 
Looking at the chart, price strength also edged lower, with the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a floor of 58.00.
 
As of writing, the index is now tracking at 55.96, with a floor of 53.00 the next possible target for bears.
 
Bulls have so far rejected this advance, with MATIC rebounding from earlier lows, currently sitting at $0.9588, at the time of writing.

In the world of crypto, Bitcoin’s price action has been referred to as a Trojan Horse. In this case, buyers are first attracted by the digital currency’s historically rising prices, but by holding and trading coins buyers unknowingly legitimize and organically promote Bitcoin. Thus, its true benefits, decentralization, a fixed supply and freedom from central planners, are further disseminated.

                              <span>A bill introduced by Sen. Wendy Rogers reflects growing interest in bitcoin from U.S. states.
Sen. Wendy Rogers (R-AZ) has introduced a set of bills aimed at making bitcoin legal tender in Arizona and allowing state agencies to accept bitcoin.
The proposed legislation aims to recognize bitcoin as a legal form of currency in Arizona, allowing it to be used to pay for debts, taxes and other financial obligations. This would mean that all transactions that are currently done in U.S. dollars could potentially be done with bitcoin, and individuals and businesses would have the option to use bitcoin as they see fit.
Specifically mentioning bitcoin alone, the legal tender bill defines bitcoin as, “the decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency in which a record of transactions is maintained on the Bitcoin blockchain and new units of currency are generated by the computational solution of mathematical problems and that operates independently of a central bank.”
The acceptance bill is more broad, saying that, “A state agency may enter into an agreement with a cryptocurrency issuer to provide a method to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method of fines, civil penalties or other penalties, rent, rates, taxes, fees, charges, revenue, financial obligations and special assessments to pay any amount due to that agency or this state.”
This is the second time that Sen. Rogers has introduced a bill aimed at making bitcoin legal tender in her state. She introduced the same amendment in January 2022, which died by the second reading.
Although it may appear there are slim chances of the bill passing this time, El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin as legal tender has proven to be a boon for growth and investment in the country. Recent actions in states like Texas, New Hampshire, Missouri and Mississippi all indicate increasing U.S. state interest in bitcoin and its benefits. As bitcoin adoption strengthens, the likelihood of such bills passing will only increase.</span>

Unredacted Documents Reveal Blockfi’s $1.2 Billion Exposure to FTX, Alameda Research
 
It seems that Blockfi had a lot more money tied up with FTX and Alameda Research than what was originally suggested by the firm. A CNBC report indicates that unredacted documents were mistakenly sent to the bankruptcy court, revealing that Blockfi had $415.9 million connected to FTX, and roughly $831.3 million in loans to Alameda Research.

                              <span>The new Relai Business over-the-counter service will allow businesses to purchase bitcoin quickly.
Regulated Swiss non-custodial Bitcoin app Relai has announced the launch of “Relai Business,” a new OTC service aimed at business clients. 
According to the release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, Relai Business will allow small to medium-sized businesses to purchase bitcoin within one day. The service is Relai’s second OTC solution, with the first, Relai Private, being aimed at high net worth individuals, allowing for transactions greater than 100.000 CHF / EUR.
“It’s a huge market that we are entering: There are 25M SMEs in Europe, and a growing number of them are led by bitcoiners,” commented Julian Liniger, CEO and co-founder at Relai. “In the next ten years, millions of businesses will want to allocate billions into bitcoin, and we’re gonna make it super easy for them to do so!”
The Relai app recently received a complete overhaul including a simpler buy-flow and enhanced UX. The company also added support for VISA, Mastercard and Apple Pay, increasing the options for users to purchase bitcoin. According to the press release, “the Swiss company recently reported record numbers both in terms of active users and trading volume.”
Relai allows users to retain as much control over their money as possible. The app provides non-custodial wallets which lets users retain control over their own keys and therefore full sovereignty over their bitcoin. However, it should be noted that the most secure way to store bitcoin is always in cold storage using a dedicated hardware device.</span>
