With the world’s first cryptocurrency marching closer to $70,000, it is not all rosy for banks in the United States, considering what’s to happen in the next few weeks.
 
Late Q1 Through To Q2 2024 Will Define The United States Financial System
 
While pointing to a potential convergence of events, including the expiration of the United States Federal Reserve’s Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), the expiry of the Reverse Repo Facility (RRP), and the scheduled Bitcoin halving, it appears that Bitcoin will likely reap huge benefits.

These claims are based on documents shared by crypto researcher Darkhorse, shedding light on the intricate strategies employed to influence XRP’s market value during 2015 and 2016.
 
Has Ripple Manipulated The XRP Price?
 
The court documents, part of the ongoing SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, suggest that the company directed market maker GSR Markets to execute transactions that impacted XRP prices. Specifically, these documents detail the operation of “xrp 2t 6t bots” and outline how GSR was tasked with buying and selling XRP to affect its price, including actions attributed to bots operated by notable figures within the company, such as CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen.…</span>

While there aren&#x27;t really any fundamentally new pieces or developments in the Anduro design, they do compose in slightly different ways compared to other existing sidechain systems such as RSK or Liquid/Elements. 
Anduro is a federated model that makes use of a quorum, referred to as the “Collective” in the released documents. The main distinction between Anduro and other sidechain proposals is the explicit design based around the Collective operating and being capable of spinning up and managing multiple sidechains with different architectures. This is not so dissimilar from the concept of drivechains enabled a wider network of sidechains, rather than a singular one.

The move by these banks reflects the growing interest among investors in gaining exposure to Bitcoin. Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo are providing access to approved Bitcoin ETFs to select wealth management clients with brokerage accounts upon request, according to individuals familiar with the matter.
This development comes after spot Bitcoin ETFs had a record setting week in the US, with inflows of BlackRock&#x27;s ETF hitting $612 million yesterday. The decision by Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo to offer these ETFs demonstrates their recognition of the increasing demand for Bitcoin investment options among their affluent clientele.
By providing access to Bitcoin ETFs, these banks are catering to the evolving investment preferences of their clients, who are seeking opportunities to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the growth potential of Bitcoin. The availability of Bitcoin exposure through mainstream financial institutions like Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo further legitimizes the Bitcoin market and underscores its integration into traditional finance.</span>

                              <span>BlackRock&#x27;s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is poised to make its debut in Brazil tomorrow, according to a report from the largest financial market news platform in Brazil, InfoMoney. The launch follows the announcement by BlackRock that the Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs) of its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT39) will begin trading on B3, Brazil&#x27;s stock exchange, on Friday, according to the report.
“Our digital asset journey has been underpinned by the goal of providing high-quality access vehicles to investors,” said Karina Saade, president of BlackRock in Brazil. “IBIT39 is a natural progression of our efforts over many years and builds on the fundamental capabilities we have established so far in the digital asset market.”
IBIT39 will initially be available to qualified investors, with retail access expected to follow in the coming &quot;weeks.&quot; The management fee for IBIT39 is set at 0.25%, with a one-year waiver and a reduction to 0.12% after reaching $5 billion in assets under management.
In the United States, where Bitcoin spot ETFs were cleared by regulators in January, BlackRock&#x27;s Bitcoin ETF has emerged as the most popular option, accumulating over $9 billion in assets since launch. According to Bloomberg data, BlackRock&#x27;s ETF attracted a record $612 million of inflows in a single day yesterday.
Despite the success of Bitcoin ETFs, Saade emphasized that BlackRock&#x27;s launch in Brazil and the United States does not constitute an endorsement of Bitcoin itself but rather a recognition of its relevance as an asset class. “Our goal is to serve our customers with safe and transparent products. We have no recommendation or any expectations regarding Bitcoin itself,” Saade explained.</span>

Bankrupt Terraform Labs Accused Of Misusing Funds
