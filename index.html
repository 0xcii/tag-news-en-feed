As initially reported by Coindesk, SBF&#x27;s

Cardano Founder Celebrates Full Blocks
 
For the longest time, the Cardano network has been referred to as a zombie chain due to it not seeing as many transactions as other networks in the same category. However, as the price of its native token, ADA, has been on the rise, so has the network usage.
